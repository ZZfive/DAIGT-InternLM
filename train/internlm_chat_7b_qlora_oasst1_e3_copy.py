Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\n\nIn like matter of this, article, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, "Paris bans driving due to smog," by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\n\nLikewise, in the article, "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota," by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn\'t that far from you and doesn\'t need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.',
            'Text DAIGT Detection: Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there\'s always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\n\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a "carfree" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\n\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris\' incident with smog. Paris\' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\n\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it\'s hassles, but in hindsight, it has it\'s benefits.\n\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.',
