"Being able to know what your students are feeling in class may help a whole lot! Facial Action Coding is advance technology to show the scientist what people are feeling. Few scientist are wanting to put these in schools so teachers know what the students are feeling about there class if they sleepy or bored the teachers will be able to know because of the computer.

First, to have this new technology in class is valuable. It's valuable because will be able to understand there student more and if they need help because with the new technology they will know that. If the students need help the computer acknowledge that the student is confused and teacher can go and help them even though they might say they dont need it the facial program will identitfy that they do. It is benefical to both teacher and student because they will be able to know if the person is down or sad depending on how their facial expression is and how they are in need of help of some sort.

Second, the way this new technology works is it uses the way your face is constructed. It using your cheek bones they way you smile and the way you get your wrinkles when you do. But it takes a few scientist to figure it out like Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of FACS. He has classified the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. They all have very basic but common features but not a whole lot. For example, when youre mad your mouth shrinks and your face tightens up. Which is called your orbicularis oris around your mouth.

To wrap this up i am for this. I think teachers can use the help with this new technology.      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sysytem that enables computers to identitfy human emotions is a geat idea. I am all for the new technology. I plenty of reasons why.

One reason the new technology is a good idea is so you can tell wheather a child is bored or no in school. In the text it states,'' A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr Huang predicts. Also in the text is states,'' The same technology can make a computer-animated faces more expressive for video games and video surgey.

Second reason the technology is a good idea is because the computer can can tell how your feeling one day and how your feeling the next day. In the text it states,'' The computer has six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Also in the text it states,'' For example , your frontails pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. The technology system has diffrent emotions.

Finally a third reason why the technology is a good idea is because it helps produce your face expressions. In the text it states,'' According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emtion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. For example; coach Constantin stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

The new technology is a great idea because One it can tell wheather a child is confused or bored, Two the technology can tell what face expression and how your feeling one day or the next, and finally Three the new technology helps produce your face expressions.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The new Facial Action Coding System cannot be very accurate due to humans being able to hide emotions quite easily. As it says in the beginning statement, ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" Thus meaning this software is not one-hundred perect reliable. Human beings can hide emotions without even trying. It is impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.

In many movies actors act amd perform in different emotions everyday. Think about how an actor can use deception to trick the watcher into thinking they are upset and angry in the movie. Behind thr scenes the actor could be hystrically laughing but we dont see that, we only see the acting part. Therefor it is impossible for human beings to be able to detect someones true emotions, not even an advanced computer application can do so.

In paragraph 2 a statement catches the eye by saying, ""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotionslike math homework?"" First off the human body is not a calculation, it is a living creature that has feelings and emotions. You dont just calculate the emotions to find them out. To find emotions you get emotionally attatched to someome or get close to them by talking to thrm amd they will vent to you and find out what is going on, either if thry are happy or sad.

In the writing it talks about Mona Lisa,and how she was feeling during that moment. Many may say you can do this and find out how she was feeling, but others will say it is impossible to find her emotions. Those others would also say to find her true emotions you would have to ask her, in which you can no longer do because she and the artist are deceased. No one will trully know how she felt durung this time, unless she states her feelings somewhere.

In paragraph 6 it states that,""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad."" It later on states thag only looking into the webcam it could detect your emotions. Not only could it really not detect your emotions, it would make people feel unsafe because they are constantly being watched looking for a face to read. The Facial Action Coding System cannot read someones true emotions. The program may predict amd see what the individual is feeling, but it is trully impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Is the ""Facial Action Coding System"" really going to be able to read and react to students emotions? Well this new technology can read the facial expressions of a student therefore it can change the classwork based off how the student is feeling but, a computer can't really read a students true emotions just based off their facial expressions.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman is used in a new innovation created by Prof. Thomas Huang, Prof. Nicu Sebe and their collegues. This Innovation is a sort of program that allows a computer to read a persons emotions based off their facial expressions The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, states Dr. Huang. Although the facial expressions of a person are similiar to another like smiling for example, however we may unconsciously have an expression even though we are not feeling the emotion that expression conveys.

""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" this shows we may show an expression without truly feeling that emotion the expression suggests. Therefore can this technology really help a student in a classroom setting?

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. with this said it may become frustrating or irritating to the student with the constant changes. This technology sounds very convincing but think of an emotionally challenged teenager can the computer keep up or truly read the emotions of the teen just by facial expressions alone? ""Eckman has classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."". The technology can always improve but at the state it's in right now it may not be as accurate as needed to be in a classroom setting with only having the basic emotions proggramed. Although the technology is advanced and helpful to an extent it may not be something we can use right now.

This technology is helpful but also not good enough for students to enjoy and be helpful. This technology as previously mentioned can alter the classwork a student is doing based off their emotional state. According to Dr. Huang this technology can read mixed emotions as well but with only six to go off of it may not be a truly accurate answer and may make the student feel another emotion because it could not respond properly. This technology should be tested and improved on before going in a classroom setting.

In conclusion the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a technology not ready to be put in schools but is still a good innovation. The new technology can't read all their emotions just based off expressions alone but in the future change accordingly to a students emotions hopefully based off not just expressions and be ready for students to utillize.

When I was around eight years old, I joined a softball team not really knowing how to play.

Also I didn't know anybody or even know what to do, but joining the team taught me so much I wouldn't be where I am without it. It's been six years since I started playing, and I'm still friends with everyone that was on my softball team. Extracurricular activities such as clubs, sports, and the student council can and will make a big impact on students. I agree that students should participate in extracurricular actives because, they teach students teamwork, help them gain social skills, and keeps them healthy and active.

When students join an after school sport or club there will be others they may not know, playing on the same team. The first rule in teamwork is work as a team no matter what circumstances. The people on your team are the people that have your back at the end of the day. Even if you mess up in a game, practice, or a match, they are the people that going to tell you it's going to be okay. Even outside of school or practice, like the classroom you might have to do group work, and work as a team but you would already know how to. By doing extracurricular activities teaches students teamwork and will make students better at working as a team.

Joining extracurricular activities will improve and/or teach students social skills. Like when they first get on the team or get into the club, with other students they will most likely don't know. You have to have build teamwork but before that you need to get to know the people on your team by introducing yourself. There's always going to be a group of people that already know each other so, they will have to speak up. Not only would it build their social skills but it will expand their friend group.

After school sports and clubs will also help keep you healthy and active. Extracurricular activities like sports are usually everyday afrerschool about two hours. Sports like soccer or basketball will keep students running so they would be physically active and keep their heart healthy. Clubs like chess and student council students wouldnt be running but helps their mental health. Also both sports and clubs will boost mental health so much because you have friends you can talk to when your upset or going through anything.

Extracurricular can help you so much not just by hanging out with friends but by, teaching students teamwork, help them gain social skills, and keeps them healthy and active. Which will help students in the long run and also in the classroom. Students can just try it out and they will probably end up loving the activity and new friends they've made.                     ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"During the summer, students are given a plethora of work by their teacher for the upcoming school year to ensure that students are able to recall and apply their knowledge over the summer. Unfortunately, many of these projects and assignments are teacher-designed and lack the ability to properly ensure the retention of information over the summer. Instead, over-break projects should be student-designed as this would help students learn and memorize information better, make students have a more interactive experience, and make each student have a unique project based off their specific needs as a learner.

The unique nature of student-created assignments allows the student that creates their own project to have better retention of the material covered by the project due to a psychological concept using episodic memory. This psychological concept is a proven memory technique that uses personal experiences (episodic memories) as a link to the concept or term the individual is trying to learn and remember. This can easily be applied to the homework given over their break as when students design their own projects they are able to make mental links with the project components and the information they are doing a project on. These links allow them to be able to retain the information better as they have memory to draw back on when they think about the concept. Unlike this, however, teacher-designed projects have many students mindlessly doing their homework; thus, missing the connections with the experience and the concept. While, with student-designed projects they are forced to think about the concepts and project links as they create and complete the assignment.

Student-created projects also tend to be more interactive as it forces the student to engage with the project in through its interesting components. I have experiences with both sides of the argument as I am a high school student; this has caused me to partake in both teacher-made assignments and student-created projects. Overall, I have noticed that the teacher-made assignments tend to be more dry and more like busy work, rather than student-based assignments which are more interactive as they incorporate games, colorful activities and modern slang sprinkled throughout the assignment. This makes the work much more enjoyable for students as they are able to have fun doing the work. This also helps them retain information better as they are focusing on the work yet still enjoying it rather than mindlessly doing the work because you were told to do it. These fun, interactive activities are both fun for the user but also achieves the end goal of stimulating the student's knowledge over summer break.

While also interactive, student-created assignments are also unique to each student. Students understand their weakness and will be able to create a project that is catered to them and their specific strengths and weaknesses in order to better their current knowledge of the subject. For example, Generic_Name has trouble on cardiology for her AP Biology class; so for her project over the summer she focused on the anatomy of the heart and the blood circulation process of the human body. This allowed Generic_Name an opportunity to research and study cardiology and other heart-related processes, thus increasing her knowledge of her weakest subject within AP Biology. Therefore, every single student is given the opportunity to fix their individual flaws through these student-made projects. On the other hand, a standardized teacher-made assignment barely addresses their weaknesses. This is due to the fact that teacher-made assignments are generalized to all students and only brush the surface of every topic in order to cram all the information onto the one assignment. While conversely, student-made assignments are able to go deep into concepts the student struggles with due to the student being able to create the project.

Student-created projects have the ability to increase the knowledge of the material covered by the project, dramatically. It also gives the student a more pleasurable experience compared to a teacher-created assignment due to its interactive nature and more student catered experience through games and activities. However, the most important aspect of student-created projects is its ability to be a unique assignment that is perfectly created to address the needs and wants of that student as it is the student in question that is creating it. These three characteristics of student-created projects allows the student to grasp and retain the important information they need to learn and remember over the summer. It is my understanding that the student, the person who knows what they need to learn, should be given a project that caters to them and gives them the best opportunity to learn and remember information through a medium that allows them to understand the concept without getting bored of it. So why choose these standardized teacher-created assignments that are unable to meet the specific needs of its students? Why not go for the better option that allows students to flourish in their own creative and unique way? ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Limiting car usage has so many benefits to it, you may think ""Oh my gosh, I need my car!"" when in actuality this is better. Limiting car usage is great because you can save money on gas. We all know gas prices are going up, why worry when we don't need cars? Just think about how much money you spend on gas.

In addition, conserving car time can be beneficial to our health. If we don't get our lazy butts out of bed just to sit in a car and get fatter then we would be so much happier. Remember that new years resolution you made to lose more weight? Well ride a bike to work everyday, or ride a skateboard to school. We will stay in shape this way.

Not to mention, fuel creates pollution in the air, someof us are OCD about the air we breathe. By biking places, you can keep the air cleaner. Thi s is also quiter and brings us all closer. What if you biked to work with your friend instead of by yourself?

In conclusion, there are so many reasons why limiting car usage is the way to go. Think about how many times you can talk to your neighbor besides the regular ""Hey, how ya doing?"" when you see each other. The world can become so much closer to itself, just by not driving.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal:

School policy should change so that only students with a grade B average or above can participate in sports and other activities. Three reasons for the new policy are that school is a place to learn, sports and other activities keep students from doing homework, and students in school activities should maintain a creditable grade so that the students who have a C average and lower can raise their grades and the school's funding.

Foremost, school is a place to learn. Many students need to spend more time learning rather than going out and playing. If students with grade C average were in sports that would not help them much with their schoolwork. Other activities might keep them from going to class. Some sports and activities even take students out of class, and students should not lose class time if their grade is a C average or less.

Next, other activities and sports may keep students from doing their homework. The students with a C average or less are the ones who mostly need to do their homework. Recent statistics have shown that 90% of students fail classes because they are unable to complete or do their homework. Sports and other activities usually keep students after school, thus preventing them from having their afternoon to complete their homework.

Then, the school and students will both be awarded if they have good grade. The student can have a better future for college with outstanding grades. The school will also be more recognized. Therefore they will receive more money.

Finally, the reasons for agreeing with the change of policy are that there will be better grades and good reputation.      ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In the Challenge of the Exploring Venus, the auther suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers I think he I right, but i think that the dangers are to much to risk. In the story the auther calls venus the ''Evening Star'' and said that it was one of the brightest points in the the sky,but it also said ''while venus is simple to see from a good distance, but safe vantage point from eath.'' I think what that means is that, you can't get close to venus because it's too dangerus.

Some of the ways that venus is too dangerus to go to is because we know what will happy if we go. We sent things up befor and each previous mission was unmanned but for good reason, since not one spacecraft survied the landing for more then maybe a few hours. Thats when we saw the issue and stoped sending up sacescrafts. Not one spaceship has touched down on venus in more that three decades.

A thick atmospehere of 97% carbon dioxide covers venus, also to add to that theres even more difficulit clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid on venus. On the the planet the conditions arfe far more extreme then anything humans encoouter on earth or anywhere so far. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we have on earth. besides high presurs and unbareable heats, the weather is bad too. Erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquackes, and very frequent lighting strikes.

In the end, our travels on earth and farther should'nt be limitted but at the same time we are facesed with dangers and things we sould strive to do better in but we should do our best to look at the word without getting to close to danger.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The Seagoing Cowboys is a unique job, and also a once in a lifetime oppurtunity. I think you should try it. Luke Bomberger said It opened up the world to him, ""I'm gratful for the oportunity, it made me more aware of the people of other countries and thier needs."" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""

'It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover thier food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).' As stated in paragraph 2.

'UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.' As stated in paragraph 2. Luke had made nine trips in two years of ""service."" Luke says in paragraph 5 that ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured am excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China

You have to be prepared for long, rocking, swaying trips. If just reading those words made you sick then I suggest you don't go. 'It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.' Luke had slipped down a ladder and broke a couple ribs, so, he could not do very much heavy work.

'Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and gmaes also helped pass the time.'

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun! It sounds like if I were one I would be pretty amazed and entertained. It opens up the world to you. Luke says in paragraph 9 ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thir needs."" So give it a try. See if you like it. But remember this job requires much hard work and a lot of effort. Hope you enjoy it.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Mr. Senator,

The way the voting is now in the United States needs to be changed. It should change from Electoral College to popular vote. The voting system is an all or nothing system which means lots of peoples votes would not count for the president they want. If the voting system changes the president would actually be picked by the people and not by a group of people who won the popular vote.

The electoral college is unfair to many people because their vote goes to waste if the other slate of electors won. In Source 2 it says ""On the off-chance that those electors win the statewide election, they would go to Congress and... would get... electoral votes."" That is saying that part of the votes would not count because the other group won and not the one they wanted to win. So then the president will get a certain number of electoral votes based on the population of that state. Some people feel like their votes are not needed as much because if the majority of that state chose the other candidate.

The electoral college is a good idea, but people can betray the trust of others. In Source 3 it says ""...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."" That means the voters have the ability to vote for the other candidate. If someone decides to vote for the other candidate then some peoples votes will have been for nothing. If we had the popular vote voting system then everyones vote would go to the specific candidate, and people would not have to hope the person they slate they pick has everyone pick the candidate they were trusted to vote for.

In the end the voting system of the United States is built on trust. If we have the popular vote voting system everyones vote would go to the candidate that wanted it to go to and not have their vote be wasted on a slate that may or may not win. With the popular voting system the president would win on popular vote and not electoral vote; therefore, the president could not cheat his way to power by targeting big states.

"Sports and extracurricular activities are very common in today's schools, yet in recent years the number of students who participate in these has diminished. One of the few top causes are, technology, lack of drive, and higher levels of stress. Therefore I feel, that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity to, aid in finding peers with similar interest, be stress beneficial, and drive students with the enticement of competition.

First and foremost, this will aid in finding peers with similar interest because, we are more often than not, on social media or are on our phones more intrigued in what somebody else is doing, or where they are going than what we are doing with their own lives. A prime example of this, is that people won't sign up for something they don't like. So people in chess club most likely want to be there, that is something everyone there has in common. Plus if we participate in multiple clubs or activities and the same people are in them to, they probably have similar interest that could lead to companionship. With this added benefit of friendship it opens a whole new door of opportunities for us. It means that we can have someone there for support or someone to go hangout with in the future. It can also drive us to take more risk in our life and open us to new opportunities like a new food or activity that we may enjoy.

Secondly, a lot of students, especially in late middle to high school, are under a exponential amount of stress. This can cause them to do are think about harmful or life threatening activities to them or others. To prevent this, it would be wise for us to be in a place where we can express ourselves and let off some steam. Extracurricular activities fulfill this need for relief in our lives, and A few of the ways it does this is exposure to the community by, travel, community service, or self influence in the community. Another benefit is time management, many students, my self included, struggle with time management because we are constantly over run by massive a amount of knowledge from the day or week, so that leads us to give to much or little time to self benefit. This leads to higher levels of stress when we don't have time to do anything on the spot. I have first hand experience with this where just the other day I came home after a long and dreadful day where I was to tired to do anything so I simply fell asleep even though I had plans to go with my friends that evening, but was famished of energy from school.

Lastly, it opens up a window of opportunity when it comes to competition. As human beings we strive to be the best in life. We want to have, the style, the smarts, and the popularity in life. With that said, clubs and sports allow for that through competition. For some they get to express their leadership skills, for others they get to home in on their teamwork skills and on the very rare occasion it teaches some to be humble with loss. Competition gives a sense of unity with each other because everyone is working toward the same goal, winning, and it can also build confidence though leadership. A good example is a sport coach, in some sports one of the players is actually the coach, and having that job is often a way to build confidence because it gives a sense of power to them. Even losing can help them, for some they feel that winning is the only thing in life so they get all worked up about it. So when they lose and understand that its not a bad thing. It helps them learn not to be so stressed about winning, and I used to be that way, but because I learned that I can lose and it won't kill me, I have enjoyed life more.

In conclusion, I feel that having us participate in a extracurricular activity is a highly beneficial idea that will allow for us to enjoy life with a higher acceptance. It will let us make more friends with similar interest, allow for us to be less stressed in life, and give us a higher sense of confidence in life. All of this leads to the fact of enjoying life to the fullest and sharing that with others instead of being secluded and stressed in life which is where a lot of the student population is right now in comparison to a couple of decades ago.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Cell Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become part of our social culture. These devices are used to send calls or texts to our friends and family members. However, we do not notice the dangers that cell phones pose when someone is driving behind the wheel.

Texting while driving has become a phenomenon in our society as we see more people dying because they do not put their phones down. We do not realize that they distract us when we drive causing so many vehicular accidents that could have been prevented in the first place. Drivers should not use their cell phones as they become a distraction on the road.

One of the main reasons that make using our cell phones while driving very dangerous is that it reduces your reaction time. Let's say that you are driving and you receive a text from a friend. You do not become aware that a car in front of you has stopped that you do not have enough time to react to hit the brakes. Limited reaction time leads to a dangerous car crash. We do not realize that looking at our phones more than your driving can lead to a fatal car accident where your life can end in the matter of seconds.

Teenagers in our society use their phones to record videos where they end up on social networks such as Snapchat. It has become a trend to record themselves driving behind the wheel without thinking about the consequences that comes with them. Constant phone use when driving has created an unsafe environment where we see young drivers becoming more addicted to their phones rather than focusing on going home safely. Recording a video for Snapchat not only endangers you , the driver, but your surroundings such as pedestrians, your fellow passengers, and other drivers. We must think more about the dangers that we create when we record a video by thinking about what could go wrong. Think about the lives that would be destroyed . This is another reason why accidents happen because many people, especially young teenagers , tend to become careless that they would prefer social media over maintaining control on the steering wheel.

How do we control our cell phone use when we are driving? We need to put our phones away and focus on the road. "" Don't text and drive"" messages seen on billboards are there to remind you and other drivers that it is not a safe using your phone while driving. Other road signs contain a "" drive home safe"" poster for this reason. We cannot risk our lives for an electronic device. We have families that are waiting for us to come home safely.

Distracted driving has become a hot topic in many states such as Georgia where we have a ""hands-free law."" It is illegal to have a cell phone when operating a motorized vehicle. We need to raise more awareness about our cell phones and driving that many posters shown in highways reminds drivers of the dangers they face. Informational commercials with drivers on their cell phones depict their lives where they show that being distracted by these hand-held devices can cause a fatal accident. And that we might not make it home safe . Not only do we have to be tough on drivers, but we have to remind them that we have families . And some of them may never see us again for not putting our phones away.

"As technology and digital devices improve, more and more schools have begun to utilize them by offering the option to take a class at home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to have an empty slot in their class schedule which results in students being able to come to school late or leave school early. Allowing students to take their classes by way of online or video conferencing would not be beneficial because students would be able to cheat more easily, it would be harder to communicate with teachers, and students would get more distracted in online classes than they would in school classes.

While the internet can provide long distance communication for a student to attend an online class, the internet can also provide the answers to assignments and work that the student may be assigned. If a student is allowed to take a class solely online, they will be inclined to cheat and look up answers. One counter argument that people have is that teachers have a way of seeing how many tabs are opened on the computer, but even if the teacher could see how many tabs were opened, the student could still use their phone or another digital device to look up answers. An online class would also make it easier to cheat because since the assignments would be all digital, students could utilize the copy and paste keys to look up answers quicker. If the student was taking the class at school instead, they could be given paper assignments and it would be harder for them to cheat. Online classes also make it easier for students to collaborate on assignments that they should be doing independently. Students could be using other students' help or they could be using previous students' work and it would be harder to identify.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because it would be harder to communicate with teachers. Some online classes may be taught by teachers who don't teach at the actual school the student attends. This makes it harder for students to ask them questions or ask for their help when they need it. This could cause students to not understand the topic completely and it might reflect in their grades. Online classes also make it harder for the student to build a relationship with the teacher. Because it is an online class, the student and the teacher don't really get to know each other and this could cause their relationship to be very weak. If the student was taking the in school class, they would have a stronger relationship with their teacher because the student would get to physically see and talk to the teacher every other day. The better the relationship between the teacher and the student is, the more likely it is for the student to go to the teacher and ask for help. Because the online teacher and student are not able to build a good relationship, the student might not ask questions to the teacher even if they don't understand the topic.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because students would be able to become distracted easier. Because the online class is done through video, teachers can not verify that there are no distractions present for the student. If the student was taking the class in school, the teacher would be able to see most distractions and could take them away. During an online class, the student could be able to use their phone away from the camera and the teacher would not know. This can cause the student to not pay attention to parts of the lesson and cause them to not understand as much as they might in an in school class. The student might have other distracting factors at home that would have been controlled at school like siblings or pets. At school you can produce a more focused environment than you could by taking an online class.

Online classes have some benefits, but have too many flaws to be beneficial to students. The flaws of cheating, lack of communication between teacher and student, and distractions make online classes an ineffective method of teaching. The system of online classes could be changed to try and make it more effective, but there are too many sacrifices made when you substitute in person teaching with online teaching. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes online or video conferences. Do I think students would benefit this more? Yes I do believe that this can be something that these Young Kids growing on becoming what they wanna be as adults. Do I think they would possibly enjoy this more for maybe personal reasons or making more time for other things that might be important to you as well.

Some kids that want to start working early to start saving up getting your own things, not having to worry about other people trying to get you stuff. But maybe helping family with money and things at home that they probably would want you to do for them. also putting school in mind because you might need to buy certain things for school that you might really need to get for yourself to help your learning online. Doing things on your very own for yourself and for family. caring for what truly matters.

Another reason on doing this is maybe doing things with family more, out of school activities that you might be doing Like sports. If you ever have a trip to some where with a family member or a friend. maybe take your materials and computer and do it whenever. Wherever you go and got time to get back to it when you're ready.

If not then maybe just do all the work when your back on doing whatever just dont forget about getting work done for school maybe email them too letting them know your having a trip or whatever is happening at that moment of time. You might play a sport and have a team that you love playing with outside of school and you make more time on playing with them. Wouldnt mind learning and working during the night maybe?, During the day. whenever is easiest and best for you.

Realized that there is different types of kids and people in the world where they would like to work alone and be where they prefer is better for them to work. Some kids say that being in crowds make them feel uncomfortable in some sorta way, it doesnt make them feel like they wanna be there for personal reasons that they possibly gone through in life. So thats why kids sometimes leave and go some where else that the staff wouldnt like during lunch or wherever during the day. Then the kids get in trouble for not wanting to be some where that they dont wanna be at.

So I think kids that feel this way during school in some certain classes or the whole day of school. Maybe you can have the opportunity to work your classes online instead of in school. Doing things that is possibly best for you on improving yourself in life and learning to getting your education could be a good choice for you if you dont like dealing with certain things that you agree and understand for people that want to do this too. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Have you ever imagined a world without drivers? Google cofounder Sergey Brin has envisioned public transportation systems that are driverless. Driverless vehicles is a bad idea because of, safety, more money being wasted in production, and driving itself.

First of all, the saftey of a driver is in danger when a computer takes over. At any given moment, the car can fail, and the driver can get injured. The text states, ""The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" In the 21st century, we have cell phone. If a people already today use their phones while driving, imagine when driverless cars are introduced to the public. People will be paying more attention to their cell phones that the road.

Secondly, making these car will take a large amount of money. The text say that a Toyota Prius was modified with numerous cameras and sensors to make this driverless car mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Buying a car made with all those modifications will cost you. Also, adding more systems in the car such as, entertainment and information systems, will cost money too.

Driving was always fun to everybody, but with the idea of a driverless car, the fun goes away. ""The phsychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" To fix the problem, BMW project manager says that they have to interpret the driving in a new fun way. BMW says they will add entertainments systems. That is a dumb idea because you need to be paying attention to the road.

Driverless cars, will become worse thorughout the course of its production. There will be failures within the car itself and the technology inside it. There will also be more problems to worry about, such as the systems breaking and the car breaking down. Do you really want to sit and watch a computer drive you to your destination?

"Phones VS Driving

Nowadays, it is estimated that around 5 billion people around the world own a mobile device. That is a huge amount of people but to every pro there is a con so, a major problem has come into light from all these phones. One out of four car accidents in the United States Alone is caused by texting and driving. Many people believe drivers should not use cell phones during the operation of a motor vehicle but in my opinion, it is a necessary evil to a certain extent and you should proceed at your own risk. Let me elaborate on how I came up on this assumption.

First of All, the x factor is phones have become such an important asset to our lives that most people got to stay connected some type of way. Whether you have to reply to a message from your best friend or you want to replay your favorite song, etc... Humans will always choose to pick up the phone no matter what. Laws and different measures have been taken throughout the world to stop people from picking up the phone but sadly, people still have accidents. Therefore, when laws and word of mouth does not stop this ""epidemic"", innovators step in and instead of trying to stop the act of using a phone during driving, they enhance the experience in a safer way.

Like I was stating above innovators step in, let me build on that statement. Many companies seen the safety hazard and they came up with their own solution. For example, most cars from 2007 & up come with a hands free feature. You connect your smartphone to the car through Bluetooth or a USB and you don't got to pick up the phone due to the fact you can do most of the activities that you do on the phone, on your car through a series of buttons and knobs, hence the name of the feature. In addition, many extra accessories have been created to help, not stop the use of smartphones but control it instead.

Lastly, no matter what the subject is whether its phones or something else, people are going to be people. What I mean by that is there will always be that # of people that just will not follow directions till an accident happens to them. I am a prime example of that, back then my dad would always tell me to put the phone down while I was driving, and I would be like ""yeah yeah"" sarcastically. Until finally one day I was driving home from school, and my favorite song played, so right after it ended I looked down for less than 10 seconds to replay it. Without noticing the car in front of me had stopped, I ended up rear ending her. It was nothing serious because I was going slow but still that little time I took to look at my phone could've cost me way more.

In my opinion, phones are an unavoidable problem nowadays. What I mean by that is yes they do cause accidents and they are a huge problem, but in this day and age almost everyone has a phone. Which makes the situation worsen due to the fact that we have become so accustomed to using our phones no matter the gravity of the situation.               ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I think that the first policy is the best, because it doesn't do any harm to allow students to have their phones during free time or lunch since there are no classes going on at the time. Really there are only two main problems with having cell phones during classes; texting the answers on a test or quiz to a friend, and distracting and disrupting the other students and teachers. Many kids in the middle schools have phones now and they will try to bring them into classes, and carry them around at lunch. Many other schools allow phones during lunch breaks, so I am told by kids from other schools. If a student has his/her phone in their pocket during a class but it is either off, on silent mode, or on airplane mode(phone is unable to text or call or use any sort of feature that requires a signal) it won't disrupt the other class mates. However, it still may be a distraction during class, so then they should remain either off, or not in their pocket, but in their locker. I see teachers using their cell phones in classes all the time, so why shouldn't we be aloud to use ours at lunch or free time?

If a student has a phone and they either have free time or it is lunch period, they should be able to have their phones out and be able to call or text. Some students forget things that they needed for the day and they call or text their parents to bring them to school for them; books, P.E. clothes, lunches, flash drives, assignments, and other things that you may need for a class. And at lunch breaks teachers are usually in the teacher's lounge eating lunch so we are unable to use their classroom phones to call our parents if we are in need of something or aren't feeling good.

I think that phones should be aloud in schools during lunch breaks and free time because even if they are not aloud, kids will still use them and just hide them from teachers which isn't good. If they are just aloud during free time and lunch, kids will have a set time to be able to use their phones and they won't be breaking any rules, or distracting or disrupting others. There is no harm done to allow the use of cell phones during lunch or free time, so why not let the students be able to use them if they have them?",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear principal,

I have heard that you are may start to not allow the student body not able to participate in activities such as sports, and or after school activities unless they have at least a B average. It is to say that most of the student body have at least a C. I disagree with this new rule for three reasons. The first reason is that some of the students in this school learn slower than others and may not get their work finished in time, this also is to say that it is not because they don't want to do the work but because they may be overly excessive with the quality with their work.

The second reason is that in some of the after school activities can help with the lack of work being done of the timing in the way that in some of the activities that this school has ,like sports, use math and reading which in the long-run will make the students grades superior .

The final reason is that some of the students may have disability's which may make their comprehension of what is being taught confusing and hard to know how to do that project. Most schools in North Carolina go by if the average is at least a C. i hope that you think about whatI have said about this topic which would impact the students in a big way , I also hope that you decide not to enforce this new rule .

"The ways in which students learn differentiates from person to person. while some may thrive in a structured environment, this does not work for those who learn best by teaching themselves. Summer is designed to be a break from the structure of school and is meant to be for students to be relieved of the constant conformity in classrooms. While summer projects should be regulated by the teacher, they should be largely student designed due to the simple facts that all students learn differently, students are more likely to do a project they designed themselves, and that summer is made for students to live their own lives, apart from teachers.

School is designed for very specific types of learners, when in reality there is no one way to teach that works for all students. Projects are designed to teach in one specific way, whether its by writing, reading, listening, or working, but rarely are projects fit into every category, and this is troublesome for those who learn differently. Teacher-designed projects are structured to be like a classroom and they are reflective of that teacher's style, and teachers do not influence the learning of all students in the same way. One student may learn better from one teacher, but another might be failing their class because the teacher does not teach in the style in which that student learns. When students influence their learning atmosphere, they are more likely to understand what works best for them and then excel in learning as they need to on their terms. Student-designed summer projects can give a student the opportunity to not only learn about what style works best for them, but to grow independent of a structure-based, conformitive style of learning.

Students love to follow through with something they took charge in initiating, and this trait can be exploited for student-designed summer projects. A teenager is washing the dishes without having been asked, their parent calls out ""Hey, can you wash the dishes?"" suddenly, for no reason, that teenager feels a rush of motivation to not continue doing the dishes, even though they were already on the task. This is something every teenager relates to and they will testify. This can be transferred to summer projects when they are teacher-designed, because the teacher is asking them to teach themselves in a specific way, even though they could have been doing it their own way. When a student can determine how, when, and what they are doing, they are far more likely to commit to the task. Students can design the project in a way that they will want to do it, so that it does not feel as if they have to, and they will perfect it because, well, they designed it in the first place. Summer projects that the students chose to do are obviously going to be completed thoroughly and very well.

No student wants to feel the reach of teachers any further than the school schedule, and when they do, it can feel like an invasion of privacy. Students need to be able to lead their own lives because teachers will not always be there to tell them what to do and when to do it. If students designed their own summer projects, they can learn to be independent from the structure of school and lay down the foundation for good work ethic. Summer is a relief from the conformity of classrooms and a time for students to be people in the world, not sheep in a classroom. Part of being a person is choosing what kind of life, schedule, work, and things one wants to do, and student-designed summer projects is a great opportunity for students to do this. Summer projects should be student-designed because it is an opportunity for students to learn outside of the classroom and in their own lives, in their own way.

Summer projects can be hard to commit to, especially when the student is forced in to something that does not work for their style of learning. When a student can design their classroom to fit their groove, they can learn better and commit to it fully. Summer projects are meant for the student to continue learning, and if it is designed in a way they do not learn, what is the point of it? Students should be allowed to design their own summer projects so that they can gain the most from it, commit to it, and finish it through to the end.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Based on the passage , the government would like a change in the way people drive their cars around. Some people would just get in the car and ride all day and night if they could. So what do the head source of some countries even took the drastic measures of baning driving due to so much smog and health problems in the air. Almost 4,000 drivers would be fined becuase of their actions to the news.

In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without carsin this capital of 7 million. Of course the goal was to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The turnout was huge, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on bogota. for the first time two other Colombian cities, cali and valledupar, joined the event. The day without cars is part of an improvment campain that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.

The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been of the world's prime car cultures. It is the home of Detroit, which by the way has the most and biggest car production in the U.S. alone, its also the bithplace of the first car ever the Model T. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older folk are likely to retain their license as they age .                                                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"To whom this may concern,

The ""winner takes all"" system we've been using doesn't work. Less power is essentially being given to the people, and, some are even being ignored.

In cases such as Al Gore's, the people said yes, and the College said no. And, voters didn't like this. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore lost the race, ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"", meaning, Mr. Senator, it's time for change. In addition, this system easily allows for a tie. In this event, the results of the race would be decided by the House of Representatives, which we all know would swiftly put in a vote for the Republican canidate. And, since the Senate has also been recently dominated by Republicans, they too would choose one of their own, resulting in two branches of the government dominated by one political party.

Moreover, with this faulty system, many people are being ignored. As you may recall (or not), ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""(Source 2, Paragraph 13) [(Although not seeing the ads might not have been a bad thing. (I'm just kidding.)] Why is this important? Because the people need to see and meet their canidates, but due to the electoral collage, people are being ignored. If the majority of the votes are known to be going to one canidate or the other, they will most likely not be visited by either side, because whom that state's electoral votes are going to are essentially locked in. The only states that recieve any attention are the ""Swing states"" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) that are pretty equal on both sides and can be easily swayed to pick one canidate or the other.

The only evidence to refute my claim would be that ""Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation"" (Source 1, Paragraph 7), which actually might work; however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily.

So, in summary, Mr. Senator, the way things work is going to need to change, we are being ignored and elections are being thrown. If you don't help us change this, the power of electing the president is going to remain with our, faulty, college.

I hope you consider this,

"Once school is over, students finally can enjoy their long summer break after months of hard work. Despite this, many teachers require summer projects that can turn an exciting summer into one full of stress, procrastination, and boredom. Personally, I have experienced several teacher-designed summer projects that have been a hardship to complete and require me to do unnecessary amount of tedious work. I have always wished that there was some sort of alternative that could be educational and still allow me to enjoy it, such as student-designed projects. Summer projects should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed because the students will be more likely to complete it successfully and teacher-designed projects are far more restricting and dull.

Students are more likely to complete their project successfully if they design it themselves. In the past, I have experienced many summers in which I was assigned a specific teacher-designed project, and the majority of the students in my class did not have any motivation to do it. Often times, it leads to several students procrastinating and trying to finish the entire project days before the end of their break, or not doing it at all. However, during the school year we were given different types of projects that allow us to design them ourselves, I noticed that even students who procrastinate or don't complete their summer projects have a much more successful project when they design them. For example, during the school science fair, when the students were given the opportunity to do a project on their own, they were much more motivated to complete it and finished quicker. This resulted in many of them receiving 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place awards which clearly shows how much more successful they can be. Also, when students have the opportunity to design projects themselves, it is much more engaging because they are able to execute the project in the way they please. Once they are more focused and committed to what they like, they create more advanced and successful projects that can enhance their learning, as opposed to forcing students to doing something they have no interest to do in the first place. Allowing student-designed summer projects can help them complete their project successfully due to them being more motivated to do it and being able to choose what they want.

Teacher designed projects can be very restricting and dull, which can make students have a more difficult learning process. Since teachers and students have completely different perspectives, when teachers design projects they tend to forget to consider how the student may react to it. Teachers may pick projects that are not interesting for the student and don't catch the attention of them, which makes it much harder for the student to start the project or learn anything. Many teachers I have had in the past have assigned very restricting projects that leave no room for creativity or choice, which makes it nearly impossible for students to be interested in it. Once the student is not interested, their learning process has been completely hindered by their teachers since the students have no input or ability to be creative. Furthermore, when students are assigned a project they do not want to do in the first place, it makes it much harder for them to have the drive to even start the project, which prevents them from learning anything at all. It is much harder for students to learn, or anyone in general, when they have no interest in something or do not want to complete it. When teachers design projects themselves they don't give the students the ability to be creative, which leads to restricting and boring projects that prevent students from being able to adequately learn.

A valid argument that may be proposed by people in favor of teacher-designed summer projects is that student-designed projects won't continue to develop the learning that the teachers require. However, their is a simple way to ensure that the students are still learning while making student-designed projects; the teachers could make a basic rubric or requirement that may ask for a few topics or ideas to be covered while still allowing the students to design the projects on their own. For example, a Spanish language class could assign a student-designed summer project for students to demonstrate their Spanish speaking skills in any that they please, but may require the students to use 10 conjugated verbs. Doing so allows for a student to still be creative and design the project themselves and guarantee that the learning aspect is incorporated into their project. Also, by giving students freedom to design the project how they please, this allows them to do more research and exploring on their own, which can branch out their learning not only into the required curriculum, but also learn other valid information in the long run. When the students choose how they design their project, they will have be able to be more independent and this can teach the students various more topics and they can do tasks on their own without the teachers pressuring them. Allowing student-designed projects can still allow them to continue their learning in the summer because the students can have the ability to explore and research themselves, and teachers can still install a basic requirement that ensures their learning process but still gives the student freedom.

Summer projects should be student-designed because the students will be more likely to complete it successfully and teacher-designed projects are far more restricting and dull. Student-designed projects can open up a student's imagination and creativity, and also allow them to be independent and learn on their own. They will enjoy the project more and be stay motivated, allowing them to create a more successful project that can deepen their learning. In the end, they will have a great final project and still be able to have a great summer.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Summary

The ""Face on Mars"" was found during a search for a possible landing site for the sister ship of Viking 1,

Pictures were taken during the search, a showy likeness of a human face was spotted.

An enourmous head close to two miles from end to end, was looking back at the camera.

Scientists believed it was just another Martian mesa, common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. But it had unusual shadows that made it look similar to an Egypt Pharaoh.

The ""Face on Mars"" is a huge rock formation, which resembles a human head.

Shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and because of this, it caused alot of attention to Mars. People believe that it was an alien monument, but proof showed that it was, just a natural landform.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Argumentative Essay

Few Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact.

Photographing Cydonia and the Face became a priorty for NASA.

Eighteen years after the Viking missions ended, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos in 1976.

Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. To no surprise at all, revealed . . . a natural landform. No alien monument after all, Just rocks.

When the photo was taken it was winter in April '98. A cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to look through wispy clouds to see the Face, skeptics believe that because of this the alien markings were hidden. As said in the article

""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.""

The pixels in the 2001 image spans to 1.56 meters.

While the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel.

In a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, if there were objects on the ground in this picture, you could see what they were just by looking at it.

The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, commonly found around the American West.

""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" ",0,persuade_corpus,3

Also, students could have fun while participating in these extracurricular activities. For instance, I just recently joined an majorette group, and while i'm at practice , I really be enjoying myself. Joining new teams can be scary, but its worth a try. Once you join a team you will never regret it.

In conclusion , I for once agree with the principal decisions. Joining extracurricular activities could have you having new friends , and fun , in no time.

"To the Principal:

Community service, to young people, is not always an idea of fun. Most kids and teens think of community service as a waste of time or no fun at all. This school should require community service because not only is it a learning experience, but a way to improve the community and one's self confidence.

Community service is beneficial to society. Simple tasks such as cleaning up the field, or picking up trash improve living conditions and make the environment more enjoyable to look at. I think students should be required to do some sort of community service because its not as hard as they may think, and if you put your mind to it you can get it done and move on to the things you want to do.

Community service can also help improve self-confidence. Doing good work for other people feels good. It feels good knowing that you just helped someone. Mowing a neighbors lawn or accompanying a grandparent on a walk around the park may not be what a student may call fun, but if done with a smile and determination, students will find that they are feeling better about themselves.

Overall, community service should be required because it can help contribute to a healthier environment and improve self confidence. Truly, it doesn't take much time out of the day to talk someone's dog for a walk, or mow the lawn. Today's generation needs to learn how to work and not just sit in front of the TV like a potato.

"Limiting car usage would not be good for few citizens. Some citizens are just plain lazy and have no sense of being active. But they are good sides of lowering car usage like citizens will have a more open community, citizens will save alot of money throughout the year, and the cities air would be less harmful.

To begin with, Some cities are just known for not having safe communities. But i think limiting car usage will make people interact with one another. The community will eventually join together and everyone will know everybody. Maybe the same neighbor you hate that lives across from you will become your best friend because you guys can walk to the same places together. I think that'll be utopia for cities across the United States.

To add on, They are citizens everyday that struggle everyday just to go to the store to buy some food for the house. I feel like this would save alot of money for citizens and it'll help them spend it on other things they need. I sometimes have struggled on my own to just to make it to school because i don't have any money for gas. I Think this is the main reason why citizens will benefit from the limitation of car usage.

Lastly,Limiting the car usage will greatly benefit the cities air. Some cities in the us have a bad reputation of having alot of air polution. I think after a while the cities will eventually just run on having no cars on the streets because of how good it was the cities air. It'll turn out to be a win-win situation for everyone.

In conclusion, Limiting car usage will first be a hard task to do but it think eventually everyone will adapt to it. Limiting the air pollution, saving alot on gas money, and building a better community are all great factors in this change. They're is many more good factors into doing this but these are just some i thought i should talk about.                             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In my opinion I believe change the election to popular vote because it is better for the citizens and all of the people. And doing the popular votes is better to do because it gives everyone a chance to vote for who they want to support for their president.

The Electoral College may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying there state, knowing their vote will have no effect at all, they will tend to have less incentive to pay attention to the campaihn than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So thats not far to every state.

The Electoral College is mostly regared as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that out to be overuled by declaring the cadidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. The electoral College is totally unfair to the people who want to vote for president and outdated. The best arguments based on reality. Onlu 270 people have to voke to elect the president and thats crazy because they could all gang up and be told to chose only one person and thats unfair to the other person running for president. The best argument against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system really calls for much worse.

The electoal college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know have a chance of winning.

One of the most importante things that I see is how some students sacrified to take their classes at college, stay there, sleep there run to work, because if they doesno't work how they should be pay for the classes?

They can pay the classes in calm, taken the classes at home there they will be not tired to do their homeworks at night where is too late, because they are taken the classes onlien in their home where it doesno't matter at what time you go to bed because you don't have to wake up on time to go to college.

Here is another things that you can be get benefit if you take the classes online:

You get time to do any other things at home while you are doing your homework or watching a video about your classes.

When you are doing your homework and if the homework is watching a video, and if you are at home you have to write so fast, because you are at home so that's mean you can stop the video and copy the answer in calm.

You can read in calm your answer to be sure that are correctly.

You can take the classes at the time you want or that's what I think I don't know, but if you are at home you can make your own time to do everything and order.

You will be safe because you are at home.

You don't have to worry at mornings to drive all the way to college.

If you are taking the classes at home You don't have can get a traffic and be late at college.

Your family can feel happy, because you are at home and not to far way from home.

In my oponion this a good benefit, because every effort you do is a good is a good benefit, because you do this with your heart for every students is a dream go to college, so I think it doesno't matter the way you choose to go to college, the only thing that really matter is if you can dream it, you can do it.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Limiting car usage is great for people and the enviroment. There is less air pollution, less traffic jams, alot less stress, and people going out on the sidewalks enjoying the scenery and having fun! Limiting car usage can be very good in many ways!

If people limit car usage there will be less air pollution. Because cars use a non-resuable gas, (Gasoline and Desiel) they must be burned in order for the cars engine to power the car. After it burns and gets used up the exhaust pipe from the car leaks out the Carbon Monoxide that resides in the car after the gas is burned. When realised into the atmosphere, the gas damages it. Not allowing enough sun to get in, creating smog which is harmful for the human to breathe, and blocks vision for many people! SO if we stop using cars or at leaste limit them, then we won't have these problems that often or even AT ALL! If there were half the amount of cars driving around everyday then we would have a much more beautiful sky than we do now, also we would not have as much fog as some people do. Like Paris. They banned driving for a few days because of smog! ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Duffer Paragraph 1). So if we limit car usage we wouldn't have this problem!

If we limit or eliminate car usage in a certain area for a certain time, then people can go outside, enjoy the scenery and get some fresh air. Because of cars existing you don't really see much people walking on the street unless they don't have a car. People with cars just drive past everything and don't really look around, but people who don't have cars enjoy the scenery, get fresh air, and get excersice. It is proven that people who rather ride a bike or walk to a destination opposed to people who drive a car are more phisicaly fit than those who normally drive a car to their destination.

To clnclude, if people limit the car usage in the world there bwill be less pollution and all around more friendliness between all people and people will enjoy the life around them, rather then sitting in their cars!               ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Everyone has asked for advice or asked for someones opinion on things. Asking for advice is something we all do. We want the approval and acceptance of others to try to fit in. I have asked many people their opinions on my hair, clothes, shoes, etc. Knowing that I'm accepted by my peers makes me feel like I fit in more. School is like a game; if you don't wear the same clothes, talk the same or act the same then your out and you lost the game you didn't even know you were playing. Seeking multiple opinions can help you because you get a different perspective on things, you start to learn how to make the best decicions for you, and you'll become accepted and less judged.

One reason why people ask for others opinion on things is so that they get a different perspective. Looking at something one minded and not being open to other ides can block creativity. Causing you to not be so confident in your desicions. Which personally makes me paranoid. Yes, we all make mistakes and learn from them, but we won't learn anyhting if all people do when we make a mistake is judge you and hold a grudge. So getting somebody else's perspective on what you wear, say, and do can stop you from making a mistake that most people won't forgive you for.

Another reason why people ask for others opinion on things is so that you learn how to make the best desicions for you. After a while, you'll start to want to explore with your life and do things you want to do. Asking people for help when you most need it can help you prepare and be ready for situations that will come. Then after you can decide for yourself knowing that you won't be judged for it. Going outside your comfort zone can make you more confident and more proud of your choices. Having someone else decide for you sometimes can help you learn what choices are best for you.

Lastly, another reason why people ask for others opinion is so that they will be approved and accepted by others. I'd rather ask for others opinions then choose for myself and then be outcasted and embarrased. Being rejected and not loved is one of my worst fears, so I'm not gonna let it happen by making the wrong choice. Being outcasted by the entire school just because you wore the wrong thing or you said something that somebody didn't approve of is heartbreaking. Everyone wants to be loved and accepted by others, so why don't we just ask for their way of seeing things. Most of my classmates feel the same way. I think we all just want to fit in and be normal.

In conclusion, asking for peoples opinions can benifit you in many ways. It could even be an asset later on in life. I know that it's good to be different and unique, but in school and life it's not. If someone is unique in life then they will be squashed like a bug by everyone else and seen as nothing. I feel like that sometimes and so do my peers. Being judged and feeling like nothing can bring down you self asteem. Who knows though, maybe later on in life it will change. We'll just have to wait and see.                ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Im going to be talking about driverless cars and my oppinion or position on them, I think they are a great idea, they keep people safe and notifies when they need human skill required.

Driverless cars keep you safer than if a human was driving, human error can make the difference between life and death when it comes to driving, if there is a car that doesnt need to be driven by humans, we need to fund it for safety and the advamcement of our society. Driverless cas are also safe for when they have problems that the car's computer cant handle then it notifies the driver when it does want human skill, eventually we will have cars that will need no human skill and fatal car crashes will not happen as often. If the car can drive itself and not crash nearly as often as humans do then what if everyone had one, will there be no more fatal car crashes or even crashes, will crime rates go down because the car will most likely have a sensor that is related to the owner of the vehicle so they cant get away from the police or car owner.

In a perfect world there will be no more car crashes of any sort, yes there will be the occasional fender bender, but with no more death because of fatal car crashes and saftey will rise and crime rates will go down, these are all what if's, but if these were to come true the whole world will change completly.

"I agree with the principal that all students should at least have one extracurricular activity .What activities do you like ?

There are plenty of extracurricular activity's you could do along with reasons why you should do at least one activity. It can help out with exercise and staying healthy ,getting things off your mind and having fun. There are plenty of activity's you could do that you could like.

Reason one is there's activities that can help you exercise and stay healthy like soccer,football,basketball and more .You could get more into them and play them while having fun .Example before you play soccer or any other sports you exercise first to be stretched out. In that way you can stay healthy.

Also having fun if you have nothing to do you can do fun activities like working on the school yearbook and helping out in community service .And in sports you can have fun to by meeting new people that like the same activity as you. Having fun in stuff you love. Example you can have fun by spending time with your friends and activities you guys love .

Last activities can help you get you things off your mind and focusing on yourself .You can have so many things on your mind like family problems ,tests,school activities can be a way of getting things off your mind you could do boxing to release anger and stress .And bring out the fun in you .

In my conclusion you should do at least one activity to be productive and be able to stay healthy ,get things off your mind while having fun . I know theres other stuff you need to complete but you can make time for an activity.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Some schools want students to continue their education outside of school so that the students will be prepared for the following school year and so that the teachers won't have to spend their class time reteaching a certain subject. But the summer projects that schools give to their students are more then likely made by teachers making those projects not fun and boring. Students should be the ones make the projects because they lose some of their summer do to working on the teacher's project. If the students were to make these summer projects they will be fun, not as time consuming, and not difficult.

Summer projects should be fun for the students so that they will actually learn and remember what the project was actually about over the summer break. So if a student make their own project they will try to make as fun as possible for themselves for their summer break and the project won't make their summer boring. If a student has a project in a science class the student could make a project about wildlife and the could keep track of all the different animals they seen over their summer. Another class that a student should make their own project in is history because the student could write down all the historical buildings and places that they seen over the summer break while traveling. The summer is a time for students to relax and stop worrying about school and homework but if a school decides to give out a summer projects the students should be allowed to make it as fun as they want it to be for themselves.

Next a summer project should not be extremely time consuming so the students will actually have time to enjoy their break from school. If teachers were to make a summer project it would take all summer but if a student was to make a project it wouldn't be very long. Most students will travel throughout their summer break so a long summer project will stop them from traveling as much as possible but if the project was shorter they could travel more and experience life to the fullest. If a English teacher was to make a summer project it may require a students to read 15 books over their break, but if a student make that project for English they could lower that amount to 4 book meaning the have more time to have more fun and not sit around reading all the time. The summer is about fun and not school work so if a school decides to make a summer project the student should be the one who decides how long it should take and not the teachers.

Finally a schools project should never be difficult because summer is supposed to a stress free time and the time for students to relax. If a project is too difficult a student will not want to do it at all and so they will not understand anything when they go over said project the following year, but if a student was to make the project it be easy so they will actually want to do it over their break and understand what may happen that following year. If a student is make their own project they will make it easy so that they will have no issue working on the project over the break and will get a good grade the following year on said project. If a math teacher was to give a summer project that makes students work out a big packet with a ton of questions in it a student will never finish it and they will receive a bad grade, but if a student was to make the packet it would shorter and a whole lot easier for themselves not requiring the student to struggle over their break. The more difficult a summer project is the student will never learn from it but if a student was to make their own it wouldn't be difficult and they would continue to learn over their summer break.

In conclusion a student should be allowed to make their own summer projects because teachers make everything more difficult then possibly needed. A summer project needs to be fun, easy, and short so a student can enjoy their summer to the fullest and still come back to school the next year ready to learn. So if a student make their summer project they will fufill the school by still learning and still having a great summer.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Today's world is full of ideas and innovation. Sometimes there are good ideas, and sometimes there are bad ideas. You can never expect all good ideas from one person, and that brings me to Sergey Brin, co-founder of the world's biggest search engine Google. Brin states his company is developing a car that operates without a driver- to an extent. Do not be fooled, Google has not came up with a completely autonomous car, though the project's future does seem bright.

There are many faults when it comes to a self-driving car. First, you will have to understand that, despite all of the technological advances brought on by our society, the car has advanced fairly slowly. With this, one has to realize the change from a car controlled by a person to a car controlled by itself may not be well-suited.

Secondly, there seems to be somewhat of a complication when it comes to regulations of a new concept. For example, in the passage ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", the author brings up the issue with creating new traffic laws in order to accomodate the autonomous car. Would that not be a hassle? In my opinion, there are far more things to worry about than a driverless car. All of the time used to create laws, roadways, hubs, and so forth could be spent on medical research or fixing our environment.

On the other hand, the industry of making and manufacturing these cars and their components could create jobs for people living in our desperate country. On the flipside of that, what if, similar to all other industries, labor is outsourced in order for companies to establish an edge early? When dealing with social issues such as these, all conditions must be considered before moving on.

With this idea of self-driving cars, I really can not say I agree with the project. I feel like if there ever was to be a car like that, the problems would far outway the common good of it all, and perhaps the whole thing would turn into a hastly jumbled mess. All in all, the idea of an autonomous car seems outlandish and unnecessary, not to mention sloth in an already lazy America.          ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Why should we stop using cars especially to our everyday advantage? Cars can pollute the air running on normal gas rather then hybrid cars though. Why is being car-free such a big hit? Will the use of cars come to an end? Not driving cars can be good for us in many ways.

""Congestion was down 60% in France after 5 days the smog rivaled in Beijing, China, wich is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" (as Robert Duffer says in pragraph). The pollution can spread and make it worse some where else but be pollution free there. In france diesel feul is to blame for their pollution 67% compared to 53.3% of gasoline. Not using cars for only just a small amount of time can get rid of much of the pollution. Some people say its more stress free to not have cars around.

Being car-free is becoming more known and more people are trying it. There has been less traffic jams too. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" (as Andrew Selsky states in pragraph 21). Also that of having no stress and nonpolluted air. In Bogota, Columbia cars have been banned for 3 years. People are being more active and walking more, this is helping a lot because everyone is getting more excercise and being healthier and having no pollution is a plus because you can also breathe easier.

""Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (as Elisabeth Rosenthal states in paragrah 29.) The United States is very cultural based on cars. The use has dropped drastically because in 2013 the miles driven was 9% below the peak. A part of it was because some people dont make much money or have jobs. sociologists believe that being car-free can be a benefit to society but bad for car companies. More people are using technology to communicate rather then driving somewhere too see them in person.

Being care-free is a great way too live your life, theres so many advantages to not having to use your cars. This helps save money from gas or car problems. It helps you be healthier and more active. All in all it even helps pollution one of the biggest problems we have and a main cause is the gas from cars.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The studying of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The studys of Venus has almost the same features of Earth, using old technology that could help, and might danger humans.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing you this letter today to talk about the new policy of at least a B average to play sports. I do not favor this idea because most of our athletes in the school have only C averages. Our grading system for sports should stay as it is also because there really is no purpose of even having sports if you don't have good players. If you do decide to change this most of the parents and student-athletes would be upset.

Also what made you want to change the rule that you must have a B average instead of a C? Was there some sort of commotion about how people think this school doesn't have enough good grades or that were not smart enough? If so you need to tell them that just because our boys football and basketball team are undefeated does not mean we are not smart.

Our academic program here is already good as can be and i do not believe we can up how well we are anymore which would be pushing the limit. Thank you for reading this letter and taking time out of your day. I hope you will consider not changing the overall letter grade our student-athletes must have.

TEACHER_NAME

I believe children should be able to use and also bring there phones to school. Just for the fact if something happens on there way to school they would be able to call there parents and notify hem what happen. Or maybe after school they get kid napped and they don't got there phone what are they going to do. Like for example i bring my phone to school just in case something happens.

I don't think kids shouldn't be able to bring there phones. What if there parents needs to tell you something like come straight home. Then they would know not to stay after school. If I was the principle i would allow children to bring there phones as long as they don't use it in class. There are lots of reasons kids should be able to have phones the have calculators on them they help you do everything like check your email. Stuff like that there like a little laptop and also teachers have them why cant we.

Schools shouldn't care off of the little things. We text instead of wasting paper. Instead of going to the office to use there phones we could use are own. Its just lunch it wouldn't hurt any one its not like were in class. most kids would probably bring there phones any way I bet if they made it to were we cant bring or phones most of the kids would still bring them. It would probably make them bring it even more. Well any way its not really up to me but if it were i would go with phones out at lunch.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. How well does this author truly show this? He shows how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, it's often reffered to as earth's twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks.

People from earth can see Venus just by looking up at the right place. The author states, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" So from afar we can see it as a big ""light"" in the sky, kind of like a star. But Venus is not a star it is a planet. What he means by this is that you can see how bright Venus is from afar but what you can't see what it is really like close up. But if we dont know what Venus is like close up then how do we know it is Earth's ""twin""?

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". According to the text ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the clostest distance too."" The passage also states, ""Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" So if Venus is so much like earth then why can't we send a spacecraft to Venus now? Well we tried and it didnt workout. There was a spacecraft sent unmanned because the spacecraft could only survive the landing for three hours. Venus today still have some features that are close to ours on earth. Could this mean it could become safe sometime? Doubtful. According to the passage, ""Venus is a planet that has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters."" So why do we need to get so up close to Venus even though it causes risks?

Wouldn't you like to know whats on Venus even if it could be dangerous? I beileve this is why the author suggest thst Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it precents. You may wonder what thoes dangers are. According to the passage, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" So why should we still go? NASA is finding a possible solution to the hostile conditions. According to the text ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hoveriing 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground confitions by staying up and out of their way."" It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means we would be able to see and get more information about Venus.

I conclude that because of all the new findings that this is why the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers. If Venus is like Earth does that mean that what happened to Venus might happen to us? This is why we need more information. The author shows us how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, its often reffered to as earths twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks. These are very important to know when deciding weather it is a good idea to travel to Venus even with the dangers. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obselete way of electing the President. It is, essentially, an indirect way for voters to choose their candidates, by voting for electors whose loyalty is not guaranteed. The Electoral College vote can override the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 Presidential Election. Some say that the Electoral College is a system worth keeping, because it provides a certain outcome and avoids run-off elections, yet these arguments are founded on little reason.

Undoubtedly outdated, this system is a catastrophe in the works, the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy (11). Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occassionally, it is yet another fault in this system.

Not only is the Electoral College irrational, it is also simply unfair. Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters (12). Other sources say a tie would be unlikely. However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way (12). Because of the ""winner-take-all"" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or unfavor them (13).

It is simple, the Electoral College system is a turn-off for many voters, especially after the incident in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. Voters can be discouraged if they have no hope of carrying their state, like Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in Cali (23). Assuming that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election (23)"" is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. Relying on the popular vote may make a tie more likely, but it would free voters from an obselete and untrustworthy system. Over 60 percent of voters oppose the Electoral College (9) which is enough to bring attention to these facts and, hopefully, address them before another controversial occurance.

The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and near-mishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters. The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.                                                               ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

I have been told that you wanted to change the policy on the grade students should have to play in sports (if you have a grade C average than you wouldn't be able to play) , and that you also wanted the students views on that. Well I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME and I know for the majority, most kids wouldn't think it fair if you went into action with this policy, and there are other reasons you shouldn't put this policy into action too, here are some of them.

One reason why you should put this policy into action is because if the majority of the students have a grade C average at your school, then SCHOOL_NAME would lose many team members, this policy might make you think it would encourage kids to have better grades, but it might affect the team for those who want to slack off, not even necessarily slack off because a grade C average isn't even failing. Unless you want the school's reputation to go down by losing many games because they have little members, than you could follow through with this policy. But I wouldn't encourage it.

Another reason why I wouldn't encourage putting this policy into action is because a grade C average isn't considered failing, and in most schools for activities they won't let you participate if you are failing, but it would be fine with them if you had a grade C average. Not that we are in competition or anything but I am sure SCHOOL_NAME wants to be represented as a good, cool, and fair school.

Also another reason could be because maybe a student has a grade average C in one of their elective classes, now that definitely wouldn't be fair if someone didn't get to do sports because they had a grade average C in an elective class. Electives are supposed to be a privilege, not something you should base whether they play sports or not. And the fact that they had a grade average C in that class and saying that they couldn't play sports wouldn't be fair because if they aren't even failing the class then they should have the right to play.

These are a few reasons why you shouldn't tell kids they can't play sports if they a grade C average. Think these reasons over and thank you for the time being that you read this letter.

"The Face on Mars

Have you ever thought of being a scientist at NASA or have you ever seen the Face on Mars? Well I am a scientist and I have been very lucky to go to space and see the Face in person. It was one of the best experiences that has ever happened to me in life! Some people think that the Face was created by aliens even though there has been many tests and agreements that it is just a natural landform. I belive that it is a natural landform beacuse there is proof that scientists have figured it was just another Martian mesa, there are pictures that proves it could just be formed like that because it is common around Cydonia, and there has not yet been any proof to encourage it was created by aliens.

The scientists and I have done several researches ever since we first saw the Face. Everything has yet led to prooving it is just another Martian mesa. Looking through all the pictures, everything stated that it is just a huge rock formation. The rock resembles a human head with eyes, a mouth, and a nose. I believe that after all the temperatures such as the heat and coldness, it could have caused it to be shaped like that. There has probably even been spaceships that has landed in Mars in search of investigation. The spaceships could have formed these shapes when landing there.

As you probably know, it is very common around Cydonia to have these kind of natural landfoms. Yes, it is common to have shapes and forms that are unusual such as the Face. The only difference in this one was that it had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Theres not really much of a difference if you think about it. It is unbelievable that it's the first time poeple think of an alien doing this art work when they have never thought of this idea when we have found other evidence of natural lanforms like the Face.

There has been plenty of evidence to proove that the Face is just a natural landform, but there is no proove of it to be created by aliens. Looking at the pictures closely, there are no footprints, fingerprints, or marks to show any living life in Mars. If theres no living life in Mars, then how could there be aliens? I want you to think about that. There has not been any kind of creatures found in Mars which is shocking.

Now that I have explained myself of why I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, what do you think? Do you still believe aliens created it? If you do, I encourage you to do some research and tell me the reasons of why you think that the Face was created by aliens. After all the research I've done, all my conclusions sum up to the same knowledge through the evidence prooven. ",0,persuade_corpus,2

Teachers should design the summer project, not the students.

There are a variety of reasons why teachers should design the project. Teachers purpose in this is to make sure the students project is educational and will benifit them in the long run. A teacher is a professional and will most likey pick a topic that will help them through the summer untill they get to school. Students might pick a topic or design their project on something that might not benefit them significantly educationally. Along with teacher design would come clear and formal instructions. Provided the teacher designs the project the instrustions should be crystal clear and students will be on the right path and most likely less confused than if they had to do it all themselves. Teacher design will aswell booost the project in looking more formal provided rubric can show expectations that need to be met. When teachers provide a project for their class, everyone has the same assignment, and it not only makes it easier for them but the students. This makes said project still formal but everyone can add their creative skills making it more personal giving it their own twist. With the same summer project and teachers permission, it would aswell be easier to work with others and share ideas. Teacher design benefits the students.

There are further reasons on why teachers should be the ones designing students projects. Teachers know what will benefit the students, preparing them for their next year. Edcationally they will design a project based to fit their class and that will help their students. This is teachers being hard working and picking themselves what is best for their students. As stated previously everyone having the same project would benefit the teachers aswell. Multiple projects after a long summer is hard to grade but with everyone having the same assignment and rubric it would make it easier for the hard working teachers. The teacher deciding and designing how they would want their project would asvwell be a plus for them. They decide how they want it as well as theirs expectations, which makes it clearer for the student to unerstand as stated previously. Teachers designing the summer/schiool year projects benefit both students and teachers.

The summer project should be designed by the teachers and not the students. There are many reasons why teachers should design it, for example it makes it easier for both the teachers and the students in the long run. those who disagree state that it would make it easier, more creative, and fun for the students but realistically this is not true. School work at anytime of the year should be designed and given by the school, this puts order in the school system.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The first reason why I think the new technology to read the emontional expression for students in a classroom is valuable, because it will be helpful for students who are sad/depress These causing can be caused by bullying, a depresion, home issues, etc. In need of help from bullying meaning if the student is getting bullied we could help the stduents asking who is bullying them. Teachers can figure out why some students are have trouble during class time it can be causing by the bullying. It also can help to see if students are going threw a depression, so if the students are going threw a depression teachers can send their students down to the students consonlors and try to help their student by having a meeting and asking questions.

The second reason why I think the new technology is vauble is because the teachers figure out students why they have a lack of communication with the teachers or why being late to school almost everyday. These causing can because of depression or of bullying. Social media doesn't help either because thats the main problem or because of cyberbullying or because of schools.

The third reason why I think the FACS can help teachers figure out why student by not having suscide thoughts and etc. Being sad or lonely can lead to sucide thoughts for stduents which nobody wants. The text sates ""Accroding to the Facial Feedback Theory Emotion, moving your facial mucles not only expresses the emotions but it also may help produced them."" The FACS can help the teachers

The new technology says what your face expression is going to be to tell if you're sad, happy, surprise, anger, disgust,fear, or depressed, etc. Dr. Paul Eckman the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in the text it states that ""associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" you can tell by these epressions by your facial mucles for example your eyebrows, around your mouth. Those are reasons why I think FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is valuable for schools in the classroom.      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Generic_Name is an intelligent girl who really enjoys learning, however, going to school is not something she looks forward to. When PROPER_NAME is at school, she is a victim of bullying and it distracts her from her assignments in the classroom. Considering her situation, Generic_Name's parents decided to remove her from the toxic environment of her current school, and enroll her into online courses she can take from home. Many students are in the same situation as Generic_Name, and find going to school hard because of fear of the way their peers treat them. Although public schools provide the social aspect of student's lives, and allow them to communicate and interact with one another, many students would benefit from distance learning because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus.

As many people know, bullying is a huge problem plaguing schools all over. It takes place in schools everyday ,and many times goes unnoticed by teachers and staff due to the fact of students concealing their bullying tactics from authority, and making their victim stay silent in fear of being treated worse. These situations make it extremely hard for students to focus in class and complete their work. Bullying also makes students afraid to even go to school, which can cause them to skip and fall behind. Distance school however, gives students the opportunity to work from home, taking online classes or using video conferences to learn material. It helps the many students who experience bullying by eliminating the problem and creating a safe space for learning and creativity to take place.

Secondly, not all students work at the same pace. Many different factors contribute to the way students receive information and the speed at which they complete assignments. Some students just naturally work faster and online classes would allow them to complete school at a quicker pace. Then, there are also the students who work at a much slower pace, and need extra time to process and comprehend information without feeling rushed by their peers. Also, students who are heavy in sports, or already working jobs are often overwhelmed, and online schooling would allow them to create their own schedule based around their activities, while still staying on track and not falling behind. Whatever the situation, the option for students to take part in online school allows them to work at their own individual pace and tailor their curriculum accordingly.

Lastly, public schools are usually not the most ideal learning environments. Disruptions are frequent and they make it hard for some students to actually be able to focus and complete assignments on time. Also, behavioral problems and fights are common in public schools, and make many students uncomfortable. Furthermore, public schools often lack healthy learning environments and make focusing especially hard for students who have specific learning needs or already have a hard time concentrating. Taking classes in the privacy, and comfort of ones home is a good solution for certain students who struggle with focusing, because the environment is familiar and essentially better suited for learning.

In conclusion, many students would benefit from distance school because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus. If more schools offered these programs, bullying rates would decrease, students would have better success in learning, and students would have more excitement when it comes to school instead of stress. All in all, more schools should consider offering online courses to accommodate students, and make school a better, safer, and more successful place for all.         ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In school, students can participate in a wide range of extracurricular activities like sports, science and everything in between. The principal has made a decision that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and for good reason. Students can learn many things from these activities, they can improve on social skills and cooperation with one another, and they can engage in a fun experience that will help them grow.

Students can learn many things from extracurricular activities, such as programming or acting. Students are preparing for the world ahead of them, and activities like these enable students to get a head start on their goals for the future. Students also learn valuable life skills from these activities like cooking and sewing.

Students are able to improve their social skills and cooperation with their classmates, not only their learning prowess. Being in a team or in a club of some sort allows students to grow friendships and connections with each other, improve team building skills and expand on communication.

Students, regardless of the activity they choose to be a part of, can engage in a fun and worthwhile experience that will help them grow as people. Students can be a part of something they love and branch out their experiences, try new things and enjoy what they've worked for.

Regardless of students participating in one activity or three, the reward is still the same. Students learn all kinds of things from extracurricular activities, they can branch out to new horizons and grow as people. Students are preparing for the world ahead of them, and extracurricular activities can help them get a head start in the real world even if they are a part of just one thing.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"To Whom It May Concern:

Community service is a great way to help out the community. I highly suggest that your students help out the community. Not only does it help your community, but it makes others feel that we should do something to help out too. It can change our world. If your students work together, they can make a difference in the world.

Recycling is a fantastic way to help out the community. It helps reduce waste and does not fill up our land fills as much as we normally do. In only one hour, we can fill up a person's home with garbage. Also, if some kids drive to school, they can carpool with another student and that helps reduce pollution. If we carpool, we help reduce gas usage and it saves the air from being so polluted.

Thank you for your time. I hope you and your school can help out the community and make a difference in the world. It will be a fun experience for them to know they helped out with the community. It is all worth it for all of their hard work. Thank you for your consideration and your time.

"In today's world, we are able to say a generous amount of people are being educated around the world everyday thanks to all the technology advances and the develoment of more educated minds lately. Even though not all education systems are optimal, it is believed that education can change anyone's perspective and understanding of the world. Some schools in America have decided to take advantage of the tools we have today to give students the posibility of taking a class on a device with interactive videos and activities. There is people who disagree with this new way of giving education to students but I argue that the advantages and benefits of taking a class online outweight by far the cons because it can help those who are unable to attend regularly because of a condition or sickness, the comfort of home, or other safe environment can improve the overall performance, and those wanting to learn more can really take this as an advantage.

As of myself, I am a current student in Generic_City in a public high school called Generic_School which offers these courses online to students at no cost during the school year and over the summer with a fee. A few years ago, during my freshmen year, there was a terrible car accident relating to a senior student back then; he ended up in the hospital for more than six months. This was very devastating for the family, friends and especially to his future because he was a football player and had a schoolarship waiting for him. However, his friends at school decided to help Generic_Name's parents by selling wristsbands and shirts with his favorite color, purple, to alleviate the hospital debt. When he was able to move again, one of the first thing he had in his priority list, besides recovery, was to start his learning as soon as possible so he contacted the school's principal to see if he could take advantage of our online classes so he could catch up on what he had missed in school. With a little adjusting and permission with the county, he was able to continue with is education and he was able to eventually graduate from high school and I think this is a fantastic example to show one of the biggest advantages of onlne teaching.

I have mentioned before, I am taking an online class. I decided to take this class for the following reasons: to experience online school and see if it was adequate for me and to get this class done this year so I could focus on more specific subjects my senior year in high school. I started the course through a platform called vision used by Generic_School, which is both an in-school class resource and a online class tool. As far as I have been experiencing this new learning format, I have found many advantages to it. The course i'm enrolled in is self-paced, meaning I can do my work when suggested or work ahead if I have the time, which I have had. This doesn't happen often to me because I always find myself stressed during school hours, not thinking of learning and working ahead, but thinking about the time I can get our of the school's campus and go home. This is something thousands of students in this school had felt or are feeling. I have made a research paper describing how decoration and lighting in a classroom affect significantly the learning process of anyone at any given time. This occurs because many schools, including mine, have pure white lights and walls which can induce anxiety, stress and overtime help mental health problems appear or worsen depending on the person. This prison-like design of most classrooms and the lack of natural light really affect my focus and performance in class. However, when I find myslef in the public library or at home I can focus for longer periods of time and get my work done fater and I actually understand what I'm reading and doing better.

One might believe that when students aren't in a classroom environment, they are simply just going to find a way to cheat the system and not actually do the work and tests assigned to them like a famous Youtube creator has told his fans. Mark, or as most people know him Markiplier, is a famous Youtuber who has over 10 million subscribers and specializes in gameplays and some acting skits. He has shared his story multiple times about how he almost graduated from his engeinering career in college based on a complex but effective way of cheating the university's online grading system, which brings up the example of the potential abuse of online lessons. I agree there is those who choose to do the wrong thing and try to cheat the system, but I have known many dedicated people who have taken online courses who always try to use the resources given to them to make the most out of their education. This can be compared to a well known classic

Matilda, a movie about a little girl who has very high cognitive abilities, making her a child genius. She takes the public library as one of her primary resources for learning to read more books than any child of her age; however, Matilda was born into a family where intelligence and manners were not appreciated at all so she was shut down from her true mental capacities. If a child like her had these many resources, including an online system for lessons, she would've gone further with her learning in less time. She could have also done many courses herself to not be pushed aside by her family and made fun of for her desire to learn.

If we look back when children were working on farms and factories, we can see how much progress out society has made in the last couple decades since we open education to more and more people ever since. It is without a doubt we're lucky for this. This is why many see online classes as a good resource since it can help those who are in a hospital to keep up with their learning, the different envirnoments surrounding a student can make a difference and it can be a tool for students who want to achieve more than average.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Although extracurricular activities are great they should not be mandatory. Sports and clubs can be wonderful, but there is always a downside. Some children just don't have time. That is why I disagree with the principal because not all kids can do extracurricular activities.

Children just don't have time for extra things in their lives. Some children don't get home until very late at night because their parents work late. It's not their faults, but making extracurricular's mandatory is putting more stress on parents too. When some students get home they have hours of homework to do. Homework can make you stay up extremely late and that can make you tired for school the next day.

A lot of students have extra work around the house that they have to do when they get home. Some students have to do chores that take hours. Students have to cook dinner,clean, and babysit. Doing chores,homework,and a extracurricular activity would be too much stress for a child. If the children had to do all of that they would never end up going to bed!

There are some students who don't work well in groups. Forcing that on them would just make them feel worse. Some children have horrible anxiety and working in groups can make them afraid. I know from experience that when children that suffer from anxiety have to do something they feel they can't they will have a panic attack. That is something that is very hard to deal with and when they go into that state you can't get them out, you just have to comfort them. That is why I personally think you shouldn't force kids into activities.

Students need to be reassured that they have a choice because being forced into something is never enjoyable especially since we're teenagers. We don't like to listen and usually do the opposite of what we get told to do. Giving us the decision of if we want to do extracurricular activities or not will give us responsibility. That is why I compelety disagree with the principal. We want a choice!",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student of your school, I hope that students will have to be required to do community service. Doing community service will benefit students for their college and high school, make children realize that they need to help people other than themselves, and help solve some economical problems. Community service should be a requirement for students.

First of all, doing community service can benefit students for their college and high school, because the students will be able to talk about doing community service at their interview to get into the school, instead of saying "" I did nothing other than do some sports and have good grades."" Communit

Third of all, doing community service can help solve some economical problems. Community service can be picking up trash to making houses. So shouldn't students be able to pick up trash? Even picking up trash isn't so hard. It's not like you will die from picking up trash, but the Earth is going through some problems because you are not picking up your trash! Earth is our home. We should take care of our home, for our home has treated us so well. Students can do a lot of things to help solve economical problems.

It can lead into success in your business that you work in. Community service should not take to much time if it does you should still waste you time and have fun with it.

"""Hey Generic_Name! I'm trying to ask out this girl but I don't know what to say, so I need some advice."" Generic_Name said, ""Oh okay. You should tell her..."" I said ""I need some more advice because his advice might not work.""

People seek multiple advice because they can get more than one answer to a problem. They do that so they can summarize and break down each advice that was given to see which works well with your problem. If someone ask you the same question, it will help you give another person some advice and help them. If you ask only one person for advice then you will barely get any information for the problem.

Pros:

It will help you give another person advice that was giving to you before

People give you multiple answers and use which one that will work out well.

It will give you a plan B if the first advice doesn't work

Cons:

They could give you bad advice and will effect you.

Before you get advice, ask someone that has experience it before or know about it. If they've never experience it before or know about it then they could give you the wrong advice or they wont know. I ask for multiple advice before and it works out well because someone gave me a lot of advice to a certain problem I had. So this is a good idea if you need some advice.  ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear principal,

We should not have to have a

B

average just to participate in sports or other activities our school provides.

C

average anyways.

I see your concern for having a

B

average because a

C

average is easy to contain.

Maybe you should rethink this a little bit, and have the students, teachers, and couches choose what the appropriate grades are to play sports.

C

average is very clear and simple.

it would be to hard for a student to have to bring there grades up to a

B

average, and focus on sports.

Some students barley make a

C

average and that is trying there hardest. Most students are good at sports and a

C

Average is just to much to ask.

I do see your point in making it a

B

average.

students come to school to learn to to play sports.

ports are and privilege not a right.

They should come to school for school and that only you can graduate without ever playing sports. But lets be honest a

B average is

Way to much to ask in a student.

"Phones & Driving 1. Today the majority of adults and teens own or operate a cell phone. The average person is claimed to spend about three hours on a cellular device daily, for others that number is much higher. With cell phones constantly being upgraded and advancing, it makes it more tempting for individuals to buy them and cause people to use them more than what is necessary. This leads to adults and teens to even be tempted to use them even while on the road. Should drivers be able to use a cell phone in any captivity while behind the wheel? Even if it's for something as simple as only using it for GPS directions. It's all up to the way the driver uses that privilege. The usage of a phone while driving should be avoided as much as possible, especially texting and driving. When you think about it, texting and driving is the equivalent to driving intoxicated or under the influence. By taking the chance and texting while driving Your putting you and innocent pedestrians in danger.

Too many people have lost their lives because someone was not being cautious, being on their device and not paying attention to the road, distracted by their phone trying to reply to a simple message that can wait till you are safely parked or not on the road. Why risk getting a ticket and having to pay money or even getting arrested or possible taking a life just by being careless and making a little mistake you could have easily refrained from. Your only increasing the chance of you getting into an accident and endangering someone's life, and if a wreck does happen is likely insurance would cost more because of the situation. You being in the wrong and caused the wreck, meaning you would have to pay more for the insurance Texting and driving is not only very dangerous it has been made illegal but yet there are still individuals who feel they just need to use their phone while behind the wheel. In conclusion, the overall usage of a cell phone.....that's why teenagers shouldn't drive with the cell phone an be on the phone because u can be focused on the phone with messages and calling an get in a crash an that's good if You got a GPS but phone are not good while driving in the dark it can costed Accident especially when you can't see an got the light in yo face an it's always good to have another person in the car with a phone an your driving.

"The planet Venus, is called Earth's ""twin"" when in reality they are only the same size. Venus is a dangerous planet, our spacecrafts haven't been able to land in three decades. The author of this article gives us evidence that scientists are still trying to find a way to land on its surface. Why? They know it's a dangerous misson, they know somebody could get hurt.

Venus's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which blankets the whole planet. The average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience. Scientists should know that if they try and send a spacecraft full of men to Venus and land they are risking lives. Scientists want to study the planet on how it used to be, they belive it used to be just like Earth and it could've supported living things.

The surface of the planet has similar feautures that resemble our valleys, moutains and craters. NASA has one exciting idea for sending a spacecraft back but it would take time and money from the government. Don't get me wrong I don't like the idea of sending humans to Venus but it is survivable. It is possible, using solar power and creating a floating blimp-like vehicle.

"Summer school: two words that don't belong together. Hardly any student enjoys doing assigned work over break. In the eyes of many pupils, summer projects are not very beneficial to developing the mind. Although the theory of the work may be sound, the excessive watch over the students is not the best way to support them; instead, they should be able to take control of their own learning. Summer projects should be student-designed so that they are able to learn about topics that interest them, which can be used later in life, rather than being walked through a uniform topic simply related to the curriculum.

If students are allowed to design their own projects, they are more likely to choose a topic of interest to them and be motivated to learn. Imagine you have a cluttered bedroom, and you begin to tidy up. Then, only a few minutes after you begin, just when your frustration is dissipating, your parent yells from another room, commanding you to clean your room. All of the energy that was there, the appeal to work, simply disappears as you realize that they did not have enough faith in you to expect you to complete the task without a reminder. Similarly, teachers are always assigning reading or projects to continue learning during summer, forgetting that students learn on their own. As time is freed up, children can learn by reading, traveling, visiting museums, and observing the world around them. Kids are naturally curious. In the classic comic strip

Calvin and Hobbes,

Calvin is constantly bored with school. It's clear to the reader based on his large vocabulary and vivid imagination that Calvin is very smart, but he doesn't do well in school because he is constantly being forced to learn addition and word problems when he'd rather be learning about space, or the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Everybody is different, so the topics and skills taught in school may not come easily to all. Because each individual has a unique skill set, they cannot all go after the same occupation, nor can they use the same information taught in schools to support them throughout their life. This is why it is so important to use summer projects as an opportunity to have the students be in control: so that they have an opportunity to do what they are good at and will be motivated to develop knowledge about things that will be helpful to them later on in life.

As students are able to learn about a topic that they enjoy, they will gain experience that will make them stand out when pursuing a future career. Many people do not enjoy their jobs. Although some do, it seems to be a somewhat common trend that the people who love their jobs had to do more work to get them. This correlation suggests that in order to do what you enjoy, you should begin learning about it at a young age to create positive working skills and higher education. An earlier start will give time to develop your knowledge on a topic, and the better you are at something, the more likely an employer will want to hire you. Perhaps if teachers assigned a summer research project, provided outlines, but allowed the students to choose the topic, they would be able to be guided but still delve deeper into something that interests them. Some might argue that teachers have the right to choose a project topic so that it is related to the curriculum, but students need to become independent and be able to learn about a topic important to them without a teacher spoon-feeding every little fact. Independent learning will allow for children to build up information on a topic and eventually use that knowledge to follow their interests to an enjoyable occupation.

It can be hard for teachers to let go and allow children to take charge over their summer break, as teachers want their students to succeed by being the best they can, but sometimes it is a necessary sacrifice. Teachers exist to essentially ""train"" students for thr real world. If this is true, then they should think of summer as a practice round to test if the students can retain past information while still making discoveries to widen their minds themselves. Making summer projects mostly hands-off for instructors will mean that students will be respected enough to take charge of their own learning. If students design their own projects, they will be able to learn about things that interest them and that will help them advance later in life as they acquire knowledge that will make them stand out while working towards their desired careers.     ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

I feel that cleaning up the community is a good way to keep the community clean. It is a good idea to get the kids involved, but I don't feel that all the kids should have too. Some kids don't have the time and effort to do those kind of activities. For example, some kids might have to do an outside activity, like sports, and don't want to take time out of doing fun activities. Maybe they don't have enough time during the day to do even those things.

I am on a basketball team myself I don't have enough time after school to do my homework. Plus during my free time, I like to do things with my friends. If you want kids to be cleaning up the community, have the ones that volunteer. Sometimes cleaning up the community isn't such the best thing to do. A school shouldn't have to worry parents that their kids have to clean the community and be at a certain place at a certain time. parents should let their kids pick if they want to clean the community. Parents should teach to pick up after themselves, but not to clean others trash forcefully.

Some kids will want to clean a community. I say that you, as the principal, should take a vote on what to do. I'll just say that I don't have the time to clean the community, but others might, so let the kids decide. If they decide not to clean the community, then let the kids at school decide on what to do with the community and go from there. Don't take my advice, I am just an opinion.

"Can technology really detect your facial expressions? Well according to the University of Illinois, the latest software from Prof. Thomas Huang of the institued for Advanced Science, can detect your facial expression. With this new software it can change our perspective on viewing our emotions.

With the knowledge of being able to know different expressions it will become much easier for learning envoirnments at schools. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is beoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. The software can recognize the expression and can change the lesson to make it a little bit more interesting or understandable. The software can detect your characteristic movement of the facial mucles. Being able to read students expession will make everything easier for the teacher and for the students also.

The software will create a big impact on learning enviornments to create a better understanding of the students emotional expression.   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In the recent passages that I have read, I have discovered how people in Germany have started the trend of not driving cars in a certain tow.  This trend has sparked new flames in places like Levittown and Scarsdale New York.  While that trend has sparked, studies have shown how many people in America have stopped driving and or buying licenses.

In passage two, I learned that Paris enforced a partial driving ban because of all of the [air] pollution.  I can't blame them.  With Paris being one of the most beautiful cities in the world, why ruin the air around it.  I do believe that Paris may be one of the most visited cities in the world because of the Eiffel Tower.

If people visit Paris for a structure that tall, I know tht I wouldn' want to come  back with the air being as bad as it is.  Just think of all the people with asthma living in such polluted air.  In Paris, 4,000 people were fined for driving their cars, 27 cars were impounded for the owners reaction to the fine.

In Bogota, Colombia, a program set out to be a national car-free day.  This program was such a succes, they did it three years in a row.  The obly vehicle access was taxis and buses in a capitak city of seven million.  The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that occasionally dumped rain on Bogota.  ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" says Mayor Anatanas Mockus.  Surprisingly, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Velledupar, joined the event. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" said Enrique Riera.

All over America, people are starting to stop buying licenses and driving cars simply because they dont care for them.  In my own opinion, I feel like Americans rely on motors far too much.  We have turned into a nation of laziness.  But as I have read, the love affair, or couch affair, with cars is starting to crumble, just like 50% of marriages in America.  As I have read, it appears that teenagers stopped worrying about licenses and cars simply for the fact that walking with friends is somewhat ""funner'

When it all comes down to it, cars are destroying our ozone, if cars are gone completely, people with breathing problems will be able to breath easier.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principle

Students should be able to have there phones at school. the reason why is because phones bring joy to anyone at school. Also instead of having no control you'll some control over them because you know what they say '' if you can't beat them join them"". Also if some one gets there phone stolen its not really your fault they chose to have them out you weren't telling them to have it out. Another reason is that it will stop kids from texting in class because they've texted enough outside. this will make every ones life easer. I believe that since you give them the opportunity they will do so. also it will improve friendship because the shy people will no longer be shy and they will spread there wings and fly. What is also good about is that if there is an emergency every student can get help. another thing is that a phone has basic needs like calculators so it will serve as a helping hand. But one thing is needed to be done it is that phones needed to be collected before a test because that can be a contributing factor to grades. So in conclusion policy one should be accepted. Not policy two because kids are even more likely to bring phones because they want to disobey you. That is why policy two should be used.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I agree with the decision to mandate all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students to discover and explore many different activities that potentially could be a career path one desires to pursue, allows for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allow students to discover many different activities that can potentially be a career one desires to pursue. Studies indicate that 65% of students who participate in an extracurricular activity at a young age pursue an occupation that utilizes/relates to a skill pertained while participating in the extracurricular activity. Students are also exposed more to the field that their club relates with. The main reason why I want to be either a senator or a computer scientist when I grow up is that I currently participate in the Model United Nations club as well as the Computer Science club. If I hadn't participate in those two clubs, my career choices would most likely be different because I wouldn't of been exposed to that area. A student who participates in an extracurricular activity also gains more knowledge in that area of expertise which can result in that student finding a profession relating to that activity with less difficulty than a someone who hasn't been as exposed or knowledgeable.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allows students to make new friends. The main reason why a student would join an extracurricular club is because they are interested in what that specific club does. A student who joins the Computer Science club is introduced to other students who share a common interest: Computers. The majority of after school clubs meet on a weekly basis, some more than others. Nevertheless, students in an after school club would see the same students at least one time a week. This provides each and every one of the students the chance to interact with each other and befriend one another. With this in mind, joining an extra curricular activity allows students to make new friends.

The majority of extracurricular activities teach students teamwork and leadership. Students that are part of extracurricular activities that compete such as the football team or Science Olympiad must rely on each other in order to win the competition. Other clubs such as Model United Nations illustrate the importance of both as students must work with and lead other students towards resolving the conflict. No matter what club students participate in, they require an important skill: the ability to effectively and diligently work with others in order to reach a common goal. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity provides them the opportunity to learn teamwork and leadership; a lifelong skill.

In conclusion, I agree with the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students the chance to discover and further investigate many different many different activities which potentially could be the career path a student desires to pursue, gives the chance for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership. It's in the student's best interest to join an extracurricular activity because even though it requires extra time out of the student's day, It teaches lifelong skills him/her can use throughout life and makes it easier to find his/her way through life, no matter what club a student decides to participate in. ",0,persuade_corpus,2

In 2000, when gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

"There is always that one specific person we like going to talk to about a situation or problems that we go through or that we have.

"Do you want to be a cowboy?

Have you ever heard of a Seagoing Cowboy? Well, a Seagoing Cowboys is the best kind of cowboy there is. When you're a Seagoing Cowboy you take care of horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped to places in the world that were left in ruins from World War ll. The cool part is that you get to go across seas and you also have time to go sightseeing. But it feels great to help people as well.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you have great responsibility. Yess it sounds like a fun getaway, but you also have to fed and water the animals at least two times a day. We also get to clean all those messy stalls, but you learn to be responsible which is important.

After you get to your destination you can go sightseeing. I got to see Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water by the way. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

On return trips after the animals have been unloaded is when you have fun on boared. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals have been. Table-tennis touraments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also help pass the time.

So if you want to be a cowboy you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. Not only do you learn about how to be responsible you also get to see the world and have fun with your other fellow cowboys. Most importantly, you help people which makes you feel good!    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"If your principal was asking you if you think it's a good idea that students must participate in at least one school activity, what would you say, do you agree or disagree. While reading this pay attention to the details that will be added about why students should or shouldn't must participate in school activities.

One reason students should be forced to take at least one school activity is some students after school just go home immediately to watch television or use their phones,the reason this is a problem is because that isn't good for their heath kids, need at least a couple of hours in the sun the reason being is the sun provided Vitamin D. Another reason is students eye sight could get worse by them looking at a screen all day. The final reason is some students are addicted to using their phones, did you know that phones can cause cancer? by students doing a sport or club this can limit screen time.

The next reason why students should be forced in doing a school activity is it can make people widen their circle of friendship, the reason being is when you talk to someone constantly you guys are immediately going to become friends. Another reason is students can become less depressed if they suffer from depression, the reason being is students who are depressed are founded to be more happy when their around more people they can talk to if they were alone it'll get worse which is why they should do an after school activity. The final reason is that students grades may improve reason being is, they might meet someone who can help them with their school work or even help them study. Another reason is students can start to feel motivated because in order to do a school activity you have to get good grades, so maybe they might start feeling motivated to have good grades. The final reason is students may feel more motivated to do their work because, after they go home they'll do their work so they can have a better grade.

The final reason why students should be forced do doing a school activity is it can make students more motivated the reason being is, while students are doing an activity they are going to feel motivated to win or have their team win. Another reason is students will start to do things more organized or on time the reason being is, now that they have some motivation from doing an activity when it comes to doing this they are supposed to do, they might do it better. The final reason is students who don't have respect can most likely gain it the reason being is, when being motivated your behavior changes really quickly, so people who have no respect might gain it.

And that was why I believe that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because, It'll keep them off their phones, it'll make students open their circle wider, and it'll make students more motivated.

Some people may think otherwise, for example some students may think it's a bad idea for students to have to participate in at least one school activity while others think it's a great idea.

The reason some people might not think it's a good idea for students to have to participate in one school activity is some students might be stressed if their forced to do an activity they don't want to do, the reason being is, some people have social anxiety this means when put around people they tend to get uncomfortable, nervous, and maybe even cry because they have no clue what to say.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Advantages of limiting car usage:

Many countries are limiting car usage for the poeple and the enivornment. The is a great way to start fresh for our enivornment and our lives. People can breath better, more plants can grow thanks to decreasing of cars and much more. Countries, for intsance Germany, France and the United states are planning to become ""car free"", and this movement is called for ""smart Planning"". Also a clear passage for people can ride thier bikes, taking a walk, etc. Another thing s less spending on gas and money to buy cars, and less stress and more safety for everyone. This may end our car culture, but this is for the better for us, and everyone else in this planet. People can spend moe times outdoors and get fit ( of course since banning cars, which means we have to walk or ride a bike to go a store) instead of sticking a car to drive. Limiting car usage is a great way for the people and the environment.

First, In Vauban, Germany, Residents of their community are surbans pioneers, because they have given up their cars. Vaban's streets are completely ""car free"", expect the main thoruoghfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg and a few streets on one edge of the community. Vabuan's families don't own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move there. Heidrun Walter, media trainer who is also a mother of two childern has said that when she had a car, she was always tense, now she happier this way, because she can walked to verdant streets where the swish of bikes and the chatter of wandering childern drown out the distant motor. Also this drastically reduce greenhouse gas. Passenger cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas in Europe and up to 50 percent in United States. United states are promoting ""car reduced"" communites as well to do the same to get better atmosphere.

Second, In paris, they have also enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In France, cold nights and warm days are caused by the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel are to blamed, because France has a tax policy that favor diesel over gasonline, which made up to 67 percent of the vehicles in France comparing to 53.3 percent avaerage of diesel enines in the rest of the Western Europe,Acoording to Reuters. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to the ban for odd- numbered plates in Tuesday. By banning the car for the enivornment, this helps for fixing the climate changes and clear skies.

Third, In Bogota Columbia, they are doing a program to spread the world to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took bues to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of thier capital city to devoid of traffic jams. This been striaght third year cars have banned with only buses and taxis perimitted for the day without cars in the capital city of 7 million. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks, rush hours restrictions have dramatically cut wonderfully, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Last, President obama's goals is to curl the United Staes' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportions is the secong largest source of America's emissions. They also believe to improve safety for others since hoew in the America, car accidents is a biggest issues for the people in United States. This can also help to fix tracffics and clearing up the air. Now, American's love affair with its vechicles seems cooling, so it the government can focus to improve the enivornment thet are living in.

Conclusion ,Limiting car is a great way for everyone and the enivorment. People can now get less sick for the gas, and plants can grow more. Clearer roads to make smooth sidewalks for people to ride their bikes , walking and much more. Lot moe safety for people, because of banning of cars. clear airs to breath and people can enjoy their lives, stress free since the don't have to pay gas, or car in general. People can be happy again, when cars usage are limiting.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"When someone needs advice, they seek help from their friend, family member, and many more. Sometimes, they only talk to one person, and maybe don't get much help from that one person. But when you get advice from multiple people, you mostly get the advice you need and want. Getting advice from multiple people is better than talking to one person.

Getting advice from other people is better than just having one person talk to you. When you're in a bad situation, obviously you need advice. Just talking to one person would not be helpful. You need more information, more advice to help you in your situation. It's important to have lots of information to help you. Some peoples advice are specific. They tell you what to do, how to handle it. It's important to get the right information. It will help you for the advice you need in order to help you out and make a better choice.

The more advice you get, the more likely it could be beneficial. Getting more advice is more helpful and could help you out more. Helpful advice is more likely to help out your problem. When in a bad situation, you need something that's helpful. By getting multiple opinions, you're getting the most help you need. When i'm in a bad situation, I always want the best advice from others. The most helpful would benefit me. But not all advice is good or helpful. More advice and opinions is better for you.

When getting advice from others, some can be really helpful. It might change your life. It might change the way you feel or think. For example, if you smoke and want to quit smoking, you hear different people's opinions and did what they told you, you quit smoking and it changed your life. Some advice might even save your life. It's common you get good advice thats pretty helpful, but some are more deep and have a lot of thought. Many celebrities often give good advice and that are meaningful. There are some quotes and phrases from famous people throughout history that also have deep meaning. You never know what advice you get might change you. It's important to always get the advice you need and listen to different opinions because you never know that it could change your life.

Often throughout time and life, many people get advice. They seek out multiple advice so they could get the best help. There could be many advice that could be deep and have meaning. If you need advice, get the most out of it and get plenty. Eventually, you will need it. By getting multiple thoughts and opinions, it would be the best for you and a lot to think about. Getting multiple opinions and advice, will help you to make the right decision. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"""The Seagoing Cowboys program is an adventure,"" stated Luke. We go all over the place, for example we have been to China and Greece. The Seagoing Cowboys program made me more aware of people's needs in other countries. When we had nothing to do we would waste time by playing games in empty holds where animals had been housed.

When I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program we helped baby cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas. We arrived August 14 when the Pacific war ended. Don and I headed for Greece with horses and hay and oats to feed them.

You should be apart of the program because it is fun to go on adventures and take care of the animals. Even if you don't like animals you get to have freetime and play games and visit places like China. When you unload the animals you can play tennis, boxing, reading, and whittiling. The program opened up the world for me.

When I took care of the animals they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Also you had to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats. Next then you had to clean the stalls out. When I worked at a farm for my aunt Katie, it prepared me for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I was greatful for the opportuniy to help the program.

You should join the program because you help people by bring the animals and you have fun at the same time.

"I vote yes that we should keep the electoral college in. Its easy to do because you don't have to count  them up yourself. I facts that these four guys even like it (Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,and Bob Dole).

Do you know over 60% of voters would prefer voteing direct election? We need more people to vote the more voters the better it will look,we don't need to beat aound the tree. This make people feel better to vote then doing it another way. So want u like you vote to go right in so you know your vote count?

The only con of doing this is we don't know who did it. You want think that really matter but it does because some can cheat for somebody. The state legislatures been picking electors since 1960. In Kennedy days when he was running he got cheated out his vote,so he lost but they done fixed all that things going well.

This is five reasons the keep the method of voting like that.#1 fact there is a certainty of outcome by that i mean it show the popular votes. In 2012 Obama received 61.7% vote and Romney popualr vote was 51.3%.#2 is he/she have to be everybody president. He/she can't play sides like her cant just do the most for the south havt to be fair fot all of them.#3 swing states by sayig that the winner-take-all. So whoever win they take it all the awarding and everything else.#4 big states with big states the elsctoral collegethe balance all it out by the popualr votes. So it compare as a small states so u bout say its even. Last #5 it can stop and avoid run-offs when Nixon and Clinton was running it was a tied at 43%.

So do you understand where i'm coming from with this. So keep it easy just let the electoral college stay around. If it was left up to you will you keep it around because i know i will. Thats how i feel bout it even know it want never mean nothing.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear, state Senator

Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Sources from source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best - laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumet. Reason 1  explains that many electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states many elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states.

Many may not realize but when they vote they're not voting for the president, they're voting for state electors, for example ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated "" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)"". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems.

The electors want to cast in more votes from big states other than small states. Source 2 quoted "" Because of the -take- all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" The author explains that many electors don't even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states.

Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,  many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.

"Think of a clear world, no smog, no pollution, just a beautiful day everyday. Now wouldn't that be nice. What if I told you that you can make it happen? It's as easy as snapping your fingers. This thing you have to do is, drum roll please..... not using your car. I know it sounds crazy right now but let me tell you about all the good that comes out of it, and maybe, just maybe you'll change your mind.

Now as most of you know there is alot of pollution all over Earth, and this pollution is caused by alot of things, but the two main reasons are cars and power plants. Pollution caused by cars affects alot of things including greenhouses. When smoke from a car reaches a greenhouse it produces a gas that negativly affects the enviroment. Your probably thinking that it's no big deal because ""theres not alot of greenhouses"", but that's where your wrong. As Elisabeth Rosaenthal says "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"".

Another thing that is caused by cars is smog. Robert Duffer, the writer of

Paris bans driving due to smog , wrote that "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capital ...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"". Congestion in France was down 60 percent after almost a week of intensifying smog. They had to stop using cars of course, but it was the only way to get the smog to go down.

Now that we've talked about the bad stuff caused by cars, let's talk about the good that can come out of not using a car as much or not at all. alot of people who participate in not using a car, weather it was for a day or for forever, have said that it reduces alot of stress and air pollution. Lower air pollution makes for more clean and clear air. Which means you get to see the day better than before, and who wouldn't want that. Overall it not only helps you, but it also helps the planet you live on, so give walking a try, you might even find seeing nature around you better than driving by it.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The bane of many students existence are summer projects. Many students dread having to complete yet more schoolwork during the time in which they are supposed to be taking a break from school. Though we may not enjoy summer assignments, it can not be denied that they do help students retain information over the summer. Some people feel that these summer assignment should be guided by the students, while others feel the teacher should design the project. In my opinion, summer projects should be teacher designed because the teacher can ensure that students are learning what they think is important, it outlines what students need to do so that they do not have to stress about making their own project, and students can assist each other due to the projects being uniform.

If the teacher designs the project, they can ensure that what the students are learning over the summer is going to benefit them when summer break ends. If students are allowed to make their own projects, the risk of them researching something unimportant or irrelevant is not unlikely. When a teacher designs the project, they can make sure that everything students are learning over the summer is important and relevant to their class. When I was in elementary school, we were assigned summer reading. This summer assignment was intended to help us improve at reading and to last most of the summer. No book list was given so we were free to choose any book we pleased. As a result, many kids chose to read short, easy books in order to complete the project as quick, and with as little effort, as possible. This puts them at a disadvantage as they did not get the same reading and word practice that other kids got. Teachers should design summer projects in order to make sure students learn what is necessary for the class.

If students are given a summer assignment by their teacher, they are more likely to complete it over the summer, rather than last minute. As a student, knowing exactly what I have to do for the assignment makes it easier for me to complete them over time. This is because I know exactly what I need to do to finish the project, thus I can plan as to when I will complete each part of the project. To have the student design the project would add an extra layer of stress over coming up with and completing a project. This leads to them putting it off until they run out of time and have to rush their project to turn it in. When they wait until the last minute, they are likely to retain less information than if they did the project throughout the summer. During the transition from eighth to ninth grade, I was assigned a summer reading of a Greek mythology book. Along with the book, I was given a reading guide to fill out and turn in when school started. Having the reading guide allowed me to split up the reading and complete it over time. I could complete a page of the reading guide and then take a break, then pick it up another day and complete another page. Overall, teacher designed summer projects encourage students to complete their assignment over the summer through providing a structure that students can follow.

Teacher created summer assignments promote collaboration as they are identical across students, allowing students to discuss with and help each other. This collaboration allows them to have better projects and learn more about the topic they are required to research. Students can share what they know in order to learn from each other. Some students are better at certain topics than others, if they can combine their knowledge with that of others they will improve their understanding of the topics. With no teacher to ask over the summer, their peers are the only one they have access to. Students can get help from their classmates and both improve their assignment, and their relationship. Being able to ask for help is greatly beneficial to students as ,otherwise, they would just leave it be and never be able to correct it. Going back to my Greek mythology summer reading, every student had to read the same book that I was. I was able to ask my classmates what they thought about certain parts of the book that I did not understand. This collaboration allowed me to better understand the book and succeed in that unit when I returned to school. Creating uniform summer projects promotes help and collaboration between students.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher created so that teachers can make sure students learn what is necessary, students actually do the assignment over the summer, and to allow students to work together on the assignment. I believe that it would not only benefits students, but also the teacher. The point of summer assignments is to help students retain or learn information. The teacher knows best what students need to learn over the summer to be successful when school begins. Teacher created summer assignments provide many benefits over student designed summer assignments and is the best way for students to learn over the summer",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I think that the best solution for this problem is to let everyone use there phones at lunch periods or any other free time. My reason for this response is because if you don't then their just going to look at the phone when you aren't looking. A simple text message is very hard to ignore at our age and wouldn't you rather have kids doing this outside of class instead of inside class? No matter where we are, and no matter what we're doing, we are always distracted by the simple sound of a text message.

If you tell kids that they can't have they're phone in school that's like telling them they can't go to a party. And the worse thing about it is that they will give you the same response; bring the phone to school and just use it when your not looking or whenever they can. We're just going to deny your request, ignore what you say and give you problems if you or anyone else tries to confiscate it. Most of us work hard and we should be allowed to do what we like when we have free time or whenever we are finished with work.

Now we all know cell phones can be distracting must of the time but that's only because we cant look at them in school. If we even have the smallest amount of time to use with them then maybe we would be more on task. And in addition to that, if you let us use them then we wouldn't be as tempted to look at then. Just try it for at least one week and i promise you that everyone will be happier.

"There is a face on Mars, and us humans can not decide if it was made by aliens or if it was made naturaly. In the pictures my crew (NASA) and I took may look like it has changed over the years but it really has not changed at all. Our picture in 1976 has a lack of good quality. From that point forward our quality has got a lot more visible.

I believe the face on Mars is a natural landform, and also there are no aliens up on Mars to make this face.

The face on Mars is a natural landfrom because in paragraph seven in the article states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all."" That is saying no alien was up there to create the landform. If there was aliens up there NASA would have annouced it. We NASA have taken pictures of Mars and have not seen any aliens upon there.

Also stating in paragraph eleven ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Saying that if there are aliens on Mars you would be able to see them on there, but you can not.

So, proven right there that there are not aliens on Mars plain and simple. This face is popular as it gets! Everyone needs to know it was not created by aliens because if it was we would already know by now in this point in time. That face on Mars is not made by aliens, it is made natural.

The face on Mars is made naturaly simple as that I can not get more simple than that.

I a NASA scientist believe that it was made naturaly no figure, no alien was up on Mars physically making faces on Mars. If we were to go up to Mars right now we would not see any alien. Anytime you hear ""Aliens on Mars created the face of Mars"" just know it is a myth. There is no aliens up on Mars, and there will never be aliens on Mars.               ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Editor

To have kids take community service is good for the world and it should be required to do community service and to clean up the school would help then people would do it but if it involves cleaning then some people will say yes and some no.

but people like me would be happy to help and keep this city clean. And my friends wanted to join them in community service and i got in with them and now that the principal wants us to clean the school and to clean the litter was easy but the rest of the school was still unfinished. So then when we were almost done we cleaned the halls, class rooms, and helped the janitors mope certain areas and now our and community service is best to do and it also takes time away from your education. So the best thing to do is to have community service on some days and get people who want to do it so the choice is yes the principal should but get people that enjoy community service. And for example like if i were to be doing the service and i enjoyed it then id want to keep on doing it but is i didn't enjoy it then i would be home doing homework. But also have it after school and get people who can stay to perform the service.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Have you ever stopped and thought to yourself what life would be like if nobody drove? There are many atvantages to limiting car usage. One advantage is that you will be a happier person. Another reason is that global warming will decrease rapidly. And also you will no have to spend money on gas so that would be more money in your pocket.

The amount of poeple that drive now is honestly crazy. With there being so many people on the road, there can be many things that go wrong. For example, car accidents. So many car accidents happen daily and unfortunantly, many people die from it. Also, road rage happens in many people. Say someone cuts you off, you get mad right? Then you may start to yell or get very tense. Many people are very tense drivers which may cause stress. If you drive less, you will not have as many of these problems.

Global warming is increasing rapidly recenlty. Global warming is very bad for the earth and could and is causing very many problems. In America, global warming is increasing very fast. Things like President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions would help to decrease global warming. Cars and a big lead in to global warming. So with less people driving cars, that could be a way to end global warming.

Millions of dollars are spend on gas money to be put into peoples cars. If people do stop driving as much as they do now, could you imagine the amount of money that would be saved? So much money would be kept into your pocket. Walking or riding a bike does not cost money. It would be a big help to yourself.

There are so many more reasons as to why people should decrease how much they drive. But it would mainly make you a happier person, decrease global warming so much, and help save you lots of money. It is something that many people should think about doing.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hello Mr. Senator I have came to the conclusion our country needs to abolish the electoral college and change to the election by popular vote. Here's a couple reasons why we should go with the popular vote.

The first reason we should go with the popular vote is because the citizens of the U.S. will get to vote for who they want. Honestly in my opinion if you use the electoral college it will be rigged. If you go with the popular vote anyone and everyone can vote. It seems pretty fair to me.

In the source by Bradford Plumer he says ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" How is it unfair? Its unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. So thats a whole couple of states who wont give votes to one certain person.

The final reason we need to go with the popular vote is the disaster factor. In the source by Bradford Plumer he says ""Back in 1960, segregationist in the Lousiana legistature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electores who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" It wouldnt be fair to the candidate.

As you can see the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The popular vote is only fair to the candidates. The candidates can compaign and try to convince people to vote for them. Its not a cheating senerio like the electoral collage so please sir go with the poular vote.              ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I believe that we should not get rid of the Electoral College because it is a process thart some people like to take! This college had a lot of electors, 538, and to elect the president you have to have 270, and theres is more than enough electorals so why get rid of it? Each candidate running for president in your state has there on group of electors. I do not think that the Electoral College is doing anything harmful or bad so I think that there is no reason to get rid of it! As many of you guys know many people vote, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. They all say that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Now I think we should also get rid of the electoral college because they backed there answer up and i could not.

"Dear Principal,

I understand your dilemma regarding a new cell phone policy. However, I do not think that it is ever a good time to use cell phones in school. Not even during lunchtime or free periods. The following reasons may help you when making your final decision.

First of all cell phones are unnecessary in school. Who would the kids be calling? All of their friends should be in school! School should be a place for learning, and texting and calling friends doesn't need to be happening. They have all the time they want after school, they don't need to be in contact with friends 24/7. If a student needs to call their parent for some reason they should be permitted to use the phone in the office.

I believe that cell phones during school will also lead to cheating. Most phones now have internet on them, and it is very easy to look up information on them. Say a student has a big history test after lunch and they can't remember the year the Alamo was fought. It would take thirty seconds for them to look up the answer on their phone. This would be unfair to students who have been working and studying hard.

Even though the first policy is still making students turn off phones during class, it probably won't happen. If a student has their phone on during lunch their not going to want to turn it off for class. It's already on so they might as well keep it on. This would also encourage cheating. Kids could text a friend and ask for the answers to questions, and the teacher may never know.

The bottom line is that cell phones are just completely unnecessary in school. Students in middle school and high school don't need to be texting and calling friends during school time. With all the things phones can do nowadays, cheating will be extremely easy for kids who are unsure of answers. And also, most students will not feel the need to turn off their cells phones for class, because they will just get to turn them on again in an hour.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Face on Mars may look like a alien artifact, but in reality, it is just another natural landform. NASA's Viking 1 found a ""human face"" twenty-five years ago on Mars. It was said to be nearly two miles from end to end. Most scientists just thought it was another common Martian mesa. A few days later, NASA put out the image for the world to see. The authors said it was a huge rock formation that resembled a human head. They also mentioned that the shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. It was believed to be just another rock.

Since the story, the ""Face on Mars"" starred in films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Many people thought the Face is evidence of life on Mars, but would soon realize it was just a rock formation. Even a few scientists actually believed that the Face was an alien artifact. After these rumors, photographing Mars became a priority. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped ten pictures. Many anxious people waited for an image to appear on a JPL web site. The image did not reveal a alien monument, but a natual landform.

On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor was taken out for another look at the Face. The picture shows a buttle or mesa; which are landforms common around the American West. Although the Face was believed to be some type of alien artifact, after three times of exploring, it was still proven to be just another natural landform. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principle,

I do not think that all students should be required to perform community service. I do not agree with this requirement because not all kids have time in their regular day to perform community services. Some students have after school sports that take up much of their time. Other students already have things at home they need to take care of. Some could have to watch younger brothers and sisters while their parents work, or watch pets while the parents work. Some students even are already starting jobs young to raise a little extra money to help out their family. I know that many students already have families, if not their own, with children that they babysit for money while the family's parents work. Community service would be a great thing to do for the students that have time for it out of their daily schedule, but for others, it just could not be possible. It is always nice to perform community service to help out, but sometimes there are other commitments that children have, and they can't just drop all of their commitments for this. That would be irresponsible, and I'm sure you want all of your students to be responsible in their commitments and outside of school activities or jobs. I'm sure their parents wouldn't allow them to break other commitments as well. So in the end, I think community service would be a great thing to volunteer, but should not be placed upon us as a requirement. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

"For me the best Policy is the first one because they will have it off during classes. Besides there is nothing wrong with calling or texting your friends. I mean what if there is an emergency and you have to use your cell phone to tell you friends that emergency. For example if you and your friends had the some classes but you have it before your friends and there is a pop quiz, you are able to tell your friends during you are walking to you next class.

Sure there might have their cell phones out during class time, then and only then the teacher may take up the cell phones and give it after class. But it will not be far to the students if a teacher takes up their cell phones on the students free time or lunch period, otherwise the teachers will be the one that will be breaking the rules or the policy. If the cell phone is the cause of their tardy then the teacher can take up the cell phone.

"Dear Principal,

I think both policies are phenomenal but, I most likely agree with policy number 1.

I agree with policy number 1 because I think students do have a right to have some time on the phone, but only on their free periods. Hence, what if something happen at home or something happens to any of your family members and your mom or dad calls you? This will count as an emergency call because, you have been called to get a dreadful news. What if something bad happened to you and you have to call your guardian saying that you have to go home because you don't feel good? Anything can happen in the moment you don't expect it. These can be some reasons to why

I think you should bring phones to school.

This are some reasons to why you could bring phones to school, just as long you have them turn off during class time. Only on lunch periods or free times you could use your phones because, you might want to spend some free period on your phone. I agree that you should turn your phones off during class because, that might be a distraction for you and your classmates, but on free periods or lunch time you might as well use your phone. With this statement that I'm trying to state, I wish you understand me, and I hope you would let us bring our phones to school just as long we have them turn off during class time, but turned on during lunch period or free time.

"Dear Florida senator,

I argue you in favor of keeping the electoral college in florida. i think it's a easier and better process than popular vote. It seems like to me it would take forever to count all the votes and add them up in all 50 states. our government counts all the votes up anyway but they count them by just it's own state. I feel like everyones voice is getting heard because it counts your vote but it's your states that votes.

The one problem I have with the electoral college is that some states are worth more votes than other states, which in my eyes is alittle unfair but it's our goverment. As florida we have 29 voter points and it's very useful to the running president that they gain our state. maybe if I was in the other states that have like 2 votes for the electoral college, then maybe I would be alittle upset and I would most likely not like the electoral college. It goes by the population of the states which makes sense because we don't want a small state choosing the president. It makes a real good point that the staes don't have the same amount of points, because if a state for example has 2,000 people and the other has 3,000 people, then the bigger population state should have the more electoral points.

If it wasnt for electoral college we wouldn't of had the great presidents we've had like for example John F. Kenndy. John lost by popular vote but won by electoral college. That is our great history and what if the electoral college saved us from a terrible president because not most of them tell the truth and are two faced. But i think electoral college is a great thing for us now and in the future.

Well thats our government and wether we like it or not their not going to change it. If it wasnt for congress and our government, America wouldn't be the same and were thankful for that. I just want to let you know senator that I like and agree with the electoral college . Keep up with all the good work Sir I know we can count on you .

"Dear principal,

I just heard that you are trying to decide on a very big topic. I thought i would wright you a letter to let you know what I think. I fell that you should require every student to do some sort of community service. There are two simple reasons why I think that you should require community service. My first reason is that it teaches the kids good live lessons, and the second reason is that will make other schools maybe try it to.

Community service can teach life lessons. Some kids look at community service as a bad thing. When you think of community service most people would think of picking up trash. Say a student hated picking up trash but for community service made him pick up trash. He would learn form this to mot litter because there are people that go around and pick up trash and now he know what it is like. Another example is say a student helping out at a nursing-home. this student could of not like to be around old people. now he would be able to see that the elders are not that bad.

My second and last reason is that maybe other schools will see what we are doing and they would try it. Can you just think of another school likening the idea you had of making kids do community service. You could inspire other schools to help make their community's a better place.

I hope you take the time to read this letter and her what i have to say.

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He provides many details over why travelling to Venus is such a challenge. However, he does not support his claim well because he does not give enough reasons as to why it would worth it to go there.

The second part of his claim has a lot of evidence for it. In the third paragraph, he details many of the dangers faced by anyone wishing to go to Venus. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. [...] temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet [...] such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This description is filled with details that cause readers to be understandably adverse to the thought of travelling to a planet with these conditions. This imagery fully supports how studying Venus would be deadly.

Despite this, the author does not do much to explain why studying Venus is worth the risk. In the fourth paragraph he claims that the reason why scientists are discussing further visits is because ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The second piece of evidence he provides is that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,"" alluding to the second paragraph, where he explained that Earth, Venus, and Mars all orbit the sun at different speeds, causing them to vary in the distances they are from each other. The facts that Venus is a little bit like Earth and that it is one of two planets that are near to Earth sometimes do not cause readers to feel like a trip to Venus is justified, because these do not seem like good enough reasons to brave the dangers. These are the only two justifications the author offers before labeling the value of returning to Venus as ""indisputable."" Compared to the huge amount of challenges in the paragraph before, readers do not feel the same way. The author then goes on to explain how NASA would send people to Venus, which does not support the claim at all.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" claims that the benefits of exploring Venus outweigh the difficulties. He gives a lot of evidence as to why it would be difficult to travel to Venus. Overall, he does not fully back up his claim, because he provides few examples of reasons why it would be worth it.",0,persuade_corpus,2

There is 335 plus horses on the cattle boat plus loads of food so you can feed them which is kinda helping them live so they can help other people that were affected by world war 2. Plus the cows can give them meat and milk so they can feed their famliys.

Plus you can have fun on the way home by playing games. One of the games are baseball/softball which is played in the place the horse and cattle were. one other one was table tennis which is basically ping ball but was called table tennis. We also did tornaments with the table tennis. There was also boxing. reading was also a option with whittling wood was also a nother free time.

"Technology has affected everything in our world as of now. How we see, move and even think has all been affected by technology. How we learn has also been affected with the help of a gift called the internet. Now people can take classes online at home instead of going into the classroom ;however, this is not always the best choice for students. There are those who argue that online learning does benefit students, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, online classes do not benefit students.

There are many reasons why online classes do not benefit students. One of which is that there are a plethora of distractions at home that can take a student's mind off of their class, such as a family. If there are younger people in the home, them they may call the student for help, or simply want their attention. Older people may call for help as well, especially the elderly. Even more so, blackouts and technical issues may interrupt the class and cause the student to lose focus. All of these stimuli can make online learning a challenge for people at home. Another issue with online learning is that the class is usually only a single student and a single teacher. This raises a concern for those who simply cannot learn like that. Groups allow ideas and knowledge to flow, amplifying the learning process. Unfortunately, online learning was not designed for group work, in fact, it would be extremely difficult to work on a project with others in an online class. At home classes also hinder the ability to have hands on work. Many classes, such as chemistry and physics, cannot even be taught online since the laboratory experiments so essential to the class can only be seen through a screen and not physically done by the pupil them self.

There are even more reasons why online classes do not benefit many students. These classes tend to be expensive, especially for upperclassmen. Some families are unable to afford the course, let alone the device the classes need to take place on and the potential need for WiFi and any other physical materials. These online classes also have a major flaw: it amplifies the student's ability to procrastinate. Since the student is at home, they can easily put off many assignments to do later, and the setting of the home gives them many excuses to chose from. Moreover, these online classes lack the physical presence of a teacher, and therefore the teacher-student bond many traditional classrooms have is not there. This may discourage the student from actually retaining the information that is given through a screen.

Although many disagree, online courses do not benefit students. The distractions of the home, inability to work in groups, and the strengthened ability of procrastination are just a few of the many drawbacks of learning online. There are still those out there in the world who would still argue that online learning does benefit students, however, they would be wrong. As technology grows better and faster than ever before, many people will have to make choices based on their specific needs and abilities.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Abolishing the electoral college would be the best way to go for everyone. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electos, who in turn elect the president. (source 2, Plumer) Some wonder, are the people in the electoral college even reliable? Many also believe that the electoral college is an unfair way of deciding whom the president will be. The electoral college is also flawwed in a way that it makes the smaller states feel less important than the bigger states.

Are the people in the electoral college always reliable? Who even knows who chooses our electoral college? Voting citizens can't even control who the electoral college votes for sometimes, this is unjust and an outrage consitering us citizens do the moral duty to vote and may not even get a fair outcome anyways. And, there are some cases in which voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. (source 2, Plumer) This ""winner takes all"" system is a big mess and highly unnescissary. Not to mention, it is also a very unfair way of deciding.

Some question if the electoral college is a fair way of voting. Which it is not. The electoral college can cause an unfair vote to the presidents which also upsets us citizens. What if say, 5,000 people vote in Florida, 3,000 for president 1, and 2,000 for president 2, and the electoral college sends it off as president 1 gets the vote for that college. But then, that 1,000 vote difference could have changed the vote for president country wide. A scenario like this may be unlikely, but it is possible. It has already happened once, it would be a shame if it did again. Chance of a situation like this draws a lot of people away from voting for president. Another unfair scenario was in 1976 when a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. (Source 2, Plumer) The electoral collage is bound to cause a catastrophe and we should stop it before it does.

The elctoral college is also unfair in a way that smaller states votes do not feel as important. Some people in the smaller states even say they haven't seen a campaign poster throughout an entire election because canidates feel as if campaigning isn't important in places that only have 3 or 4 electoral colleges. If we had a popular vote society, people in smaller states would feel like their vote is as important as those in the bigger states.

"Space is a strange place with an unlimited amount of possibilities, one of which is the possibility of alien life. Because of this, I can understand why you might think that this is evidence of alien life. In hopes of debunking this suspicion, I am hoping you will read through my provided evidence that supports my claim that this ""face"" was not created by aliens.

First off, NASA would not be trying to hide the existence of aliens from the public. Their budget is primarily based on the tax and donation of those who are interested in space. If aliens were to exist, and NASA knew this, telling the public would give their budget a massive increase. So, to dismiss the accusation that NASA is hiding proof of evidence from you, I assure you that they would have told us just to get the much needed rise in their budget.

The picture of the ""face"" was taken forty years ago, just seven years after we first landed on the moon. As stated in the article, this was, in fact, the best resolution they could take the picture with. If you put two and two together, you can conclude that the highest resolution at the time was not very high at all compared to modern day photos.

Finally, you must take into considerationg that Mars is just like Earth, a planet. This means that it will have geographical land marks just like Earth. This ""face"" has been confirmed to be butte or mesa, which are common here on Earth, as said in the article. If we were to colonize Mars in the future, and someone were to observe Earth and see such a land formation, do you think they'd call it proof of aliens? Of course not!

With the evidence I provided above, I hope you are able to make your own conclusion. As said before, the vast emptiness of space is impossible to predict, and the existence of aliens is likely. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want to believe when it comes to aliens, so I am only able to hope that you are convinced by my essay.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principle,

I heard that you were reconsidering the cell phone policy and I have some reasons that I would like to share with you why I think you should pick the first policy. I think that you should pick the first policy because us teens love having our cell phones with us all the time, and if you let us use our cell phones at lunch and other free times its pretty much a treat. The reason I say its like a treat is because when were in class a lot of people text and most of the time they get caught but if you give us the opportunity to use them in free time there will probably be less kids getting there phones taken away and less distractions.

I think that you shouldn't pick policy two because if you tell students not to bring there phone to school, were going to do it anyways. There will probably be more distractions in class such as ring tones going off, text message alerts going off, and people calling. Another reason I believe you shouldn't pick policy two is because what if a students parents need there child to have there cell phone so just in case something after school happens. Like they're going to be at the store when you get home so use your key to get in or even emergency things like if a family member is in the hospital so don't ride the bus we'll pick you up from school.

So being that the smart cars would be driving on the roads we know of now it would need a pretty excessive amount of sensors to mimic the skill of a human behind the wheel. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating senor on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, & the LIDAR on the roof that uses laser beams to project a 3D image of the car's surroundings. This is all so that in can mimic human driving ability as closely as possible & there's still much work to be done. BMW's development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013 was the 'better way' to go about having 'driverless' cars. This car was designed to drive itself standardly & notify the human driver inside when he or she needs to take over the wheel. Some might argue that having a driverless car that still needs you to drive is pointless so the ideas of in-car entertainment & information systems are going around. The ideas of these cars definitely are revolved around luxury & safety but new traffic laws would have to be made for these automobiles driving themselves because if an accident happens who is to blame? I believe there is still more troubleshooting to be as far as having a driverless car on the streets. Most states have even made it illegal to test computer-driven cars with the exception of California, Nevada, Florida, & the District of Columbia who allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. After these cars are proved to be safe overall, then they will be introduced into the public streets. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Online learning is a great opportunity for students who are unable to go to school receive education that they need. I personally used online learning this past year to take an extra class so I could fit another elective into my school schedule. But does virtual learning actually benefit the learning and the life of the students? It does not because it hinders students' abilities to a prosperous social life and it also lacks a deep connection between students and educators.

While some may argue that virtual school offers the ability for students to learn from the comfort of their homes, as well as offer opportunities for home-bound students to receive an education, those kids' learning experiences are not as successful as those who attend a physical school. I have a friend who participates in a home-bound education program because she has an immune system problem that caused her to miss a lot of school. And while that seems like a great alternative for her, there are some major flaws. She was never given a science, specifically chemistry, teacher when she transferred into the program. That means she will not receive credit for taking a science class this year, which will just put more work on her later self, who will have to ensure that she can graduate.

Virtual school also inhibits social growth among adolescents because they are not being exposed to their peers every day. Some kids can get by without going to school and still maintain a healthy social life, but other kids just aren't built that way. In fact, I was not built that way for a very long time. As a child, I was extremely introverted. So much so that I could not get myself to make friends unless I was forced to, or if someone befriended me in school. I relied entirely on school to build my social life for me. And while I have grown out of that way of living, many people have not. Those people still struggle to make friends in high school, and still rely on school to provide those opportunities for them, and while those opportunities may not be perfect, they are better than nothing.

Lastly, virtual learning does not offer the same connection between students and teachers that seeing them in-person offers. I have multiple experiences with this particular problem, and both experiences negatively affected my learning. As I mentioned before, I took an online course this past year to fit another elective into my schedule. That class was a joint personal finance and economy course; a course necessary for me to take in order to graduate. And while I was able to get by in the class just fine, not having a teacher in front of me who I could ask questions presented a plethora of problems. Anytime I had a question about certain material, I had to take more time to research it myself. Or if I had a question about an assignment, I had to either email the teacher in charge of the course and wait for a reply, or just read the directions over and over until I could guess what it was that I needed to do. Virtual learning simply does not give the same learning experience that regular school is able to give.

Online school is not beneficial to students because it hinders social growth in adolescents and does not present opportunities to build connections with educators. It also takes away really important benefits for students that rely on school for healthy meals and internet access. Virtual school is a good idea in theory, and may benefit some students in various ways, but as a whole it takes away from the overall learning experience of kids, which sets them back on their tracks towards their goals. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The Challenging of Exploring Venus

The venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to sun. But, long time ago, Venus was propably covered with oceans and it was also possible to survive. The life can be as simple as we are living in Earth. However, Venus still have some things which a living beings needs to survive. This planet has a rocky sediment anf includes such a familiar features like valleys, mountains, and craters.

Venus can also conclude as our second option, if we have to choose another place except Earth. But Venus's reputation is a challenging planet for humans to study. Not even a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Sometimes we are closer to the Mars and sometimes we are closer to Venus. This all is because of difference in speed. As Venus is sometimes right around the corner, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land.

NASA has an idea to send humans to study about Venus. To explain the idea of NASA author has used few examples like blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. Author also uses jet airplanes as an example as our jet airplanes traveln at a higher altitude to fly over many storms. NASA explains about the temperature and solar power on Venus for survivle of humans. The temperature is around 170 degrees in Fahrenheit, but the air pressure is going to be close to the sea level of Earth. Solar power will be enough and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Conditions is not really easy but enough for the survival of humans.

It's important or it's wothy to study about Venus as this is the only planet on space except Earth where humans can survive. And it's research done by NASA explains that humans can also survive in Venus but it's not going to be as easy as we are living in Earth. Venus is often referred as Earth's twin.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

I agree with policy 1 because you can interact with your peers more and talk about hanging out after school or talk about something private. I agree with number 1 again because if your having a bad day let that friend know by texting them. I also agree with them being turned off because people could cheat on tests and stuff, but if someone comes to the school with a gun you have your phone to call the police or your parents for help.

Like our school we have to have them off all day until we get outside, when most people have them on anyway. If you get caught with your hone here they take it for two school days then your parents have to come and get it. I think we should be able to have our phones during school hours in study halls or free time because we can get to know our peers more, which is good for our social life, so your don't die alone or go being depressed.

I hope you read this letter and enjoyed this letter. Thank you.

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author introduces a new form of technology, the Facial Action Coding System. The new technology allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology will not be valuable to students in a classroom because it will be expensive, communication skills will be lost, and technology is not always accurate.

As it is now, without this new technology, some schools barely have enough money to buy basic supplies needed to provide a proper education for the students. If the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is added in the classrooms it will be another expense that is not neccessary. In the passage it says, ""Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile."" This statement implys that, in order to use FACS, the school will have to buy not only the software, but also new computers that will support the system. That is a lot of money spent on unneccessary items when it could be spent on the basic supplies that most schools can barely provide now.

In today's world communication skills are bad enough already, with the current technology that students are surrounded by each day. In the passage it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" If the new technology is added into the classrom and, to a point, taking the place of a teacher, communication skills will be further taken away. Teachers teach more than just science, math, or english to the students. Having a teacher in the classroom also teaches students how to communicate properly with adults and how to carry on mature conversations. Taking away that human interaction will have a negative effect on the students.

Technology is not always accurate. If this software makes an appearance in classrooms and students start using it, it could give false information. The pasage states, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Each person's face is compared to the exact same neutral face, which will not be accurate. Each person has a different neutral face, so in order for the information to be correct, it will need to be compared against each person's neutral face.

There are multiple reasons that the new software will not be beneficial to students in the classroom, however, there are a couple reasons that the technology will be valuable. In the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" The computers telling the teacher that the student is confused could be beneficial because most students will not tell the teacher if they are confused, which causes them to get bad grades if they do not understand the material. If the teacher knows that the student is confused, they can take actions to make sure that they help them understand. Later in the passage it says, ""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" The new technology could help students understand and have empathy, which will be a good thing. Lots of people do not have a lot of empathy in today's world, which is part of the reason why the world is a very cold place. Students having empathy could result in everyone treating each other better, if they can try to understand the things that their peers are feeling.

Overall, FACS will cause people more trouble and headaches than anything. After considering both sides of the argument, it is safe to say that the new technology will not be beneficial to students in the classroom because of the combination of it being expensive, taking away communication skills, and not always being accurate.

"Every school should have a principle authority figure, otherwise who or how would schools maintain in safety, cleanliness, and education wise, but doesn't mean that they have all authority, to force their students into liking or joining any type of activity? I personally think that it would be very ignorant to push their students into signing into an activity that he or she interested at all meaningthe student that doesn't enjoy any sort of activity. I think that if some students were to be forced to choose any sort of school activity meaning they'd have to choose one they'd enjoy it because of the varieties some schools have, but what is the other percentage of students that don't seem to be interested in any sort of activity that he or shes school provide and their principle is forcing them to they'd feel very overwhelmed so is it really worth it to force students into doing such things? not really its just makes life harder for the student in reality it's not smart to pressure students especially because they are developing into adults.

First, I personally think that its great that some schools have the opportunity to have extracurricular activities like sports, arts, engineering, and photography type of activities at school but to be completely honest some schools don't have many varieties and well for the school authority figure to make such rule that their students have to choose at least one activity at their school would be really unfair for both students and parents. why would it be unfair that the school is forcing students into forcing them into signing up for extracurricular activities? Because its not right to choose something for someone without he or shes consent in this type of situation. Schools have many choices but never enough because there are a lot of different students with different interest so if this decision were to be acknowledged the school environment wouldn't be healthy because it would show that the school doesn't care for students freedom of speech, and opinion on the decision. I think that the if the principle would ask for the students opinion on the extracurricular activities half of a percentage would agree and the other half of the percentage would disagree as I do as well. I think that because why not leave this as they were the students that enjoy the school activities do what they please and the the other half that don't enjoy any sort of activity just stay as they are and don't sign into any activity. Its easier like that both sides are satisfied and get their way.

Second, I that what if the schools only provided sports type of activities and for example students would feel a really overwhelmed, and stressed out if they'd have to pick any sort of sport;because some of as students aren't the sports type and to encourage someone to do something they don't enjoy would be really harsh. I know for sure that i'm not a sport type and I knowing that for sure I have to sign up for that certain activity i'd feel I have no solution because I know for sure i'm not a jock type. If my principle or for example another students principle were to order their students to sign into an activity at least one only containing any sort of sport I know for sure that the percentage of students who don't enjoy sports wouldn't sign but if otherwise being forced into students would have to sign to prevent consequences with their principles. The question is what if a student doesn't sign up to any extracurricular activity? do he or she get into any type of conflict is it smart that that the student gets in trouble for not wanting to participate in any type or sort of activity? the answer is no really the principle would look very ignorant in this sort of situation only because the student is choosing not contribute in any sort of activity during the year.

Third, I agree that in order to maintain a healthy school environment there should be a principle provided to provide authority, and organization to the school, but is it really worth it to make students choose something they don't enjoy? No because it would be so selfish to force students into an activity that they might not even like because they meaning the students are choosing the extracurricular activity just to get away from getting facing any conflict with the principle later on. To be brutally honest i think it would be wrong for a student to be pushed into something he or she might not like and would rather not participate instead because some students are simply not interested in any sort of activity that he or shes school might provide. Schools shouldn't do these sort of things it could put the student in a difficult situation and could effect grades because they are being pressured into choosing something they arent interested in it could be tough. And that is the third reason I would disagree with the decision that the principle must suggest students should take at least one extracurricular activity provided at their school.

In conclusion, no student should have to be forced into signing into clubs, or any type of activity provided only if the student gives their own consent that they are interested in any sort of school activity that their school provides. I apoligize to whom who has this type of school environment at their school it must be tough for some students that have this type of environment in which they are forced into activities that they might not enjoy it's not bad its selfish because what if principles were to be in the same position as the student they wouldn't agree much, I think that for all theses reasons I disagree with this decision its just not fair to the students they should be able to have their own perspective on things and should be able to have their own choices. And for all of these reasons I strongly disagree with the decision that principle getting all authority yes they help schools maintain but making choices for their students would be wrong and selfish.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Cell Phone usage in cars

Do you ever catch yourself being on your phone more than you should be while driving down the road? In today's world we have had to put a lot of laws and regulations in place just to keep people safe. For example Georgia's hands-free law took effect July 1, 2018 with all new rules and regulations about cell phones being used while driving.

In my opinion parts of the law makes things safer but then some of it is a little too much. One thing that I agree with is that ""Even with hands-free technology, drivers cannot write, read, or send text messages, emails, social media content and other internet data while on the road."" I feel very strongly about this one due to there being so many people who have accidents while trying to send texts or look at the latest posts while at a traffic stop. Some parts are a little too much though, starting with ""Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while driving. ""It would be crazy to get a ticket just for your phone touching you.

Phone usage in vehicles has its pros and cons. I think it's great to have a cell phone with you at all times any time you get in a vehicle to drive in case of an emergency. Also Cell phone usage usually causes emergencies. I believe drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle, but only hands free. Also they need to make the vehicles more acquitted to ensure cell phones can only do certain things in it.

For example care could not allow any texts to be sent or received. You also shouldn't be able to make hands free cells when going certain speeds. I also think they should bult in systems for teenage drivers where it sends notifications to the parents when they go over the speed limit, break hard or drive without a seat belt.

In conclusion I feel that cell phone usage in vehicles should be allowed. They create a lot of accidents but they also save lives by calling for help. Cell phones are a lot of people's lifelines. And should be allowed usage in cars!

"Dear Principal,

Community service is great for students. It helps us understand what is going on in our community and how to help it. In every grade of school, students should be required to have at least a few hours of community service. It even looks good on an application to get into college. Community service also shows us that we are proud to be where we are and what we have.

First of all, community service lets us understand how we can help out in different ways all around us. From helping serve food at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to just helping pick up trash at our school. We can grow into being a better person knowing that we have helped. It can shape us for when we get to be adults in the world. Helping out in our community shows us what is happening on all sides of us.

After students graduate high school, most of them are going to college. When they get an application and fill it out saying that they have helped out in there community, then the college will consider even more to accept them. It shows that, that student is willing to help, work, and be a good person. Colleges want students who are smart and nice and who love to help out.

Helping out in a community not only helps other people, it helps you. Most students say that its to much work and we don't get anything from it. That is not true because we do get something from helping out. We get the feeling of pride and joy knowing that they have helped someone with less things than they have. You get a feeling that nothing else can really ever replace.

In conclusion, I think that there should be a requirement of at least a few hours to help out in our community. It shows us what is happening in the world around us and how to help it. Community service shows us how to be a better person and how to embrace being that person. Not only does it look good on a college application but it helps shape our lives in ways we can never dream of.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Venus is dangerous to human just like many other planets. This author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that it presents. Should this author really study planet Venus?

Some people look at Venus as Earth's ""twin"", because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size, and sometimes closer in distance as well. Since Venus is so close to the Earth they have sent multiple spacecrafts tp the planet but no spacecraft survived for more than a few hours. A spaceship has not touched Venus in over three decades. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus, that is even more dnagerous for humans to survive on. On Venus surfce it is over 800 degrees fahrenheit, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what ours is on planet Earth.

Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because a long time ago the planet could have once been just like planet Earth, today Venus still has some features but not many. In this article NASA has discovered a compelling idea for sending humans to Venys to study the planet. To study Venus the scientists would have to float above the fray, which is 30 or so miles above planet Venus. At 30 miles or so above the surface the temperature is still 170 degrees fahrenheit. Scientoss can not take very graphic pictures, get samples of rock, or gas from a distance, therefore the scientists have to get close and personal no metter the risks of he planet. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.

Even though there are many dangers on studying thid planet this author still wants to. There are many reasons s to why this author wants to study this planetand they are all great, but i think that it is still dangerous. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"When summer break starts most students only think about the fun they are going to have over those 3 months. They don't think about learning or gaining knowledge over this period of time. In addition, students forget what they have learned over the course of the long school year. A great way for students to learn while on summer break is to be assigned summer projects. These projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year.

Although, students can be creative in making summer projects for themselves, teachers are better equipped for this task. A teacher makes lesson plans all year so students can learn and pass semester exams. Summer projects can be a cool and fun way to learn. For example, students can create a big poster or PowerPoint displaying all of the things they have learned in school that year. If a student were to create a summer project then they might take it easy on themselves instead of doing something challenging. However, a teacher will give their students a challenge so they can think and problem solve.

Each year students learn the same thing that they learned the previous year, however, they build on what they have learned. This is why it's important for students to stimulate their brains over the summer so the information is not lost or forgotten. If teachers assigned projects to students over the summer then they would have information fresh on their brains ready to use next year.

Consequently, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year. These projects are a great way for students to learn and grow over the summer instead of playing video games.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever heard about big faces on Mars, NASA has gone on many space trips but this time they found sothing creepy. They had found big faces made in the dust, NASA said they have never heard about anything like this before So that makes me a little scared on how they got there.

I think that it is scary having planets have faces on them. these Faces were found in 1976 and it was hard to see and in 1998 and in 2001 the face got covered by sand and dust and you couldnt see it anymore. in 1976 there was a group called the Viking 1 sent by NASA. They had found a 2nd face made and it had shadows in its eyes, and mouth.

There was a big time when everyone kept talking about these faces in magazines, in social media, and in abandoned stores. ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in holltwood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery stores.""(5)

Some people say that these faces are awesome and that NASA should go on the planet Mars and explore the faces on Mars. This finding was very important to tax payers. NASA had taken many pictures of these faces they even sent another space ship to go with a better camera to take better pictures."" we felt this was important to taxpayers"", explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NAS's Mars exploration program."" we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" (6)

NASA had sent a 3rd space mission in April 5, 1998 when the space ship had passed over Cydonia the took a picture of the face. It is very hard to find this face because it was under a cloud on Mars. When the space ship took a picture there wasnt anything at all because they were in the wrong are of the planet. When the space ship got to the right place it was hidden but it was in the same place. People think that aliens had put a Haze over the face so the peoploe couldnt see it anymore. ""The camera on board MGs had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. perhaps, said skeptics, Alien markings were hidden by haze.(8)

No one has ever seen these Faces again so maybe they were hidden by some or somthing. Hopefully soon NASA will send another space trip to try to find these Faces again. It proves that a lot of people were scared at first but then they werent because the space mission couldnt find them then they did and everyone was excited. Personally i would be scared knowing that somthing had made those then hid them with Haze and clouds.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever sat in your room and looked at the ceiling for a while and you see a weird shape or face? If you haven't have you ever stared into space and seen a shape or face? Do you think of how it got there, from an alien, your imagination, or natural landform? My guess would be natural landform.

I am saying natural landform because alians aren't real, and if they were why would they create a human face. Maybe they were tryin to send a sign, if they were trying to send a sign why couldn't they have just come to earth and tell us what we need to know. What was the point of going to Mars no one lives on Mars we live on Earth.

The is a 50/50 chance that it could be your imagination, just like if you were staring out of space or looking up at the ceiling and see a random shape or face, that is your imagination, so it could be you imagination. But the scientist wasn't really focused on this ""face"" they just happened to look over an see it otherwise just like if it was your imagination you would be very focused on to something and happen to see it.

It is a natural landform because when Mars came about this ""face"" was made along with it no one else put it their it naturaly came along. You can believe that it was put their by an alien but by the evidence and how I proved it you might think that it natural landform.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Even though technology is a huge part of the world today to help with certain problem and can be really helpful to people. The author describes the FACS or Facial Action Coding System as a technology to shows a recognition to facial movement. In today's society we know that its alot of emotions being shown throughout the world no matter what's the case is. For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that don't show emotions at all. To support my claim is that no matter if parents or anybody tells them something they will not show any type of emotion any type of way, so they use equipment or something such as the FACS technology program.

The author says that from using the FACS experiment that it will make you feel sightly happy. In my opinion that is not true because that when you are down or upset you wouldn't want to do a experiment just to make you feel happy because you would think the experiment was nonsense. The author also provided us with is that if you raises your eyebrowns when your suprises and around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger is true because the FACS could shows and tell your emotion at anytime and any place.

When looking at the Mona Lisa painting it was sucessful and was one of Leonardo da Vinci's biggest accomplishment was the painting of Mona Lisa. Some of the new comptuer software that can recognize emotions, It was sucessful because the software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois with collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe Of the University of Amsterdam.

Comparing school computer and FACS is that school computer can recognize if a students is bored , or even confused about a problem there doing on a website such as Mindplay, Khan Academy , Carnige Learning, and etc. The FACS is extermely helpful and useful is because the FACS materials can be expressive for video games or video surgery. It can also help with human communication that aew nonverbal including emotional communtication. By according to Dr. Huang notes he says "" So computers need to understand that too."".

Your home computer or work computer cannot modify Mona Lisa smile. To support my claim is in pargraph 7 it says "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. "" But you can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" the different emotions.

The author says in Pargraph 9 us that the FACS can give you happy face that it can acutally be useful.

It can be false because a fake smile is when you mouth widen alittle bit with no teeth showing , and when using the FACS it can probably not show it.

The FACS technology can be very helpful for counselor, teachers , deans, doctors and even more. When someone is mentally challenge or mentally disabled the counsleor can uses the FACS to identify the mental person emotions. It can be helpful with teachers and deans is to identify the different or emotion the child has. For examples, say a child is got bully in the cafeteria for his lunch money and he just walks out the cafeteria with a frown on his face and he doesn't want to show his emotion toward the dean and/or teacher so thats when they can used the FACS technology to figure out there emotions.

The FACS is very helpful for humans that performs the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. Of course, most of us can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look of there face , you can probably tell by the look of there faces when they are happy, sad, worried that why Lenardo da Vinci made the Mona Lisa picture and his crew from making the FACS technology. The author is giving us the mood of encouraging because without the FACS technology then we would never know how people feel when it comes down to the people that don't show emotions.

In conclusion , FACS is very useful in many different sceranio. If it wasnt for the FACS technology then we wouldn't know how kids,adults,students,teachers and etc feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it can tell if a student is bored , and/or even tired. While a regular computer can tell if the student is bored. I would reccomend this in schools,hostipals, doctors office , or even in the dentist area.   ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity and heres why. I think that students should participate in a extracurricular activity because some students might not like the idea about doing a activity, However if they try it out maybe they will like it and will be interested about it. I also think that if some students try an activity such as sports, working on the yearbook, or serve on the student council, it will help them come out of there comfront zone.

First I agree on your decision because some students wouldn't like the idea about doing an activity for school, However if the students tries out an activity than maybe they will be interested in it and will carry on with it and make it a carrer in the future. Me as a student I want to play sports. Sports interest me and if I play sports I belive that it can take me a long way.

My last reason on why I agree about your decision is because certain students in our school are shy. Students that are shy can do certain activies that will help them come out of their comfront zone. I think it will help them get over their shyness.

So Dr. Generic_Name, the decision about making all students participate in at least one activity is a great idea. I relized that the activites I can do in school can help me take my carrer far as I can go. It also can help other students figure out what they want to do in the future.

"I think that the new technology entitled "" Facial Action Coding system "" (FACS) is a very smart and effective method of reading how someone feels just by there aperance me personaly I think that I can hid my emotions very well and can put on a fake smile and carry on with my day but knowing that theres technology that can read my face and tell me that im upset or angry thats amazing. I think that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a brilliant idea.

I support the new tecnology because Dr. Paul Ekman has classified six basic emotions such as - happiness,anger,surprise,disgust,sadness, and fear - and then associated each emotion with different movements of the facial muscles or characteristics. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) thightens your lips to show anger. The fact that there is classification on these six emotions just add on to the fact that this tecnology can become the next big thiing in todays society.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" ;""even though individuals often show varrying degrees of expressions"" Quoted from section (4)

meaining that the smile isn't as broad as normal and the fact that there is video imagray based off of the ""Facial Action Coding System"" (FACS) by using different units and weighing them is amazing and how they can tell your expressions just by veiwing your face and comparing it to a nuetrual face that isn't showing any emotion meaning the face doesn't show -happiness, sadness, anger, surpise, fear, and discust. I beleive that the Facial Action Coding System is a very brilliant form of technology and should be used on painting for many years to come because being able to finally tell the ""Mona Lisa's"" expression or facial recognition is amazing I couldve never told you if that painting was happy sad and or even angry and having a system that can do so is brilliant and extreamly useful. These are some of the resons that I personaly believe this system is worth using because it helps better understand peoples and or paintings expressions or faces. ",0,persuade_corpus,4

Dear Principal,

I have been notified that you are giving us two policies about cell phones.

I think that the policy that should be chosen should be ""DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO HAVE PHONES AT SCHOOL AT ALL."" I know that three main reasons there should be cell phones at school is because of time, learning, and responsibility. Cell phones will be a major distraction on these things to students.

To start off with, time is a big thing in school. Be in school on time, don't be late and if there are any important days don't miss out. Cell phones will take time away from a students learning and education. It will also affect on the students grades. I'm sure a parent wouldn't want that to happen.

Secondly, the learning of students. These electronics we speak of is a big distraction to a students learning. Cell phones will take away what the students are trying to learn in school. Students aren't really suppose to be at school texting. They are suppose to be at school learning for their future.

Last but not least, I think phones should not be allowed in school because it will bring great responsibility in a students life. If the phone ever gets stolen, damaged, or anything happens to it they are going to have to be responsible with their own actions. They wont really have the right to blame anyone else because they made the wrong choices of bringing it to school.

I really hope that these reasons will prevent your opinion from cell phones. Once in a wile they could use it at school even though they are not allowed but the students have to bring responsibility within themselves. Other people may disagree with me but i think they should understand the consequences first.

Sincerely,

A students opinion",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Work assigned over the summer is very much dreaded by students, but does that mean students should be the ones designing these assignments? A majority of schools assign summer assignments to ensure that students still receive an education during their time off from school. While there is much debate on whether the student should have the right to design these projects, the best option is for these projects to be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures that students will work efficiently, understand the topic, and that the assignments will be safe and appropriate.

In order to have quality work produced, and productive students, summer projects must be teacher-designed. Having set rules and requirements created by teachers, ensures that students will complete the tasks to a high level. During the summer, students would rather not have educational work to focus on, but projects created by the teacher enforces these students to do so. If these projects were student-designed, it could potentially allow them to finesse the system, and create a project that does not require much thinking and work. Student-designed projects also leaves room for error. Projects constructed by students leaves the door open for many mistakes, which will ultimately hurt the student in the end. This prevents students from working efficiently and fully understanding the topic they are working on. The goal of teacher-designed projects is to not control the students, but to make sure that the students are obtaining knowledge, understand the assignment, and are producing high quality work. Students may be confused or have numerous of questions with student-designed projects since there are no specific guidelines and rules, so having teacher-designed projects are ideal because they explicitly state what they are looking for.

Teacher-designed projects come with a list of guidelines and criteria that prevents students from working on something that could potentially be dangerous or inappropriate. If students had the ability to come up with their own projects, it gives them an opportunity to select a topic that could be unsafe or not school appropriate. This is especially important for science projects or English assignments. Giving students the power to choose their projects could be risky when it comes to these two subjects. For science projects, students could end up harming themselves with unsafe chemicals or substances because a lack of a rubric and criteria created by the teacher. For English assignments, students might choose controversial topics that are not appropriate for the school environment, but would not know due to a lack of strict guidelines. The possibility of projects being unsafe and inappropriate are not likely if they are designed by teachers.

Some may argue that assignments should be student-designed because it allows the student to express themselves creatively through their work. By displaying their creativity and thought process, it makes the idea of having work over the summer more enjoyable. However, having projects that are created by the student leaves room for interpretation, which could confuse students, and may take them in the wrong direction. In addition, some students may not be that creative, and cannot come up with a project on their own. Teacher-designed assignments still allow students to show what they know, but with stricter guidelines to ensure that quality work is being produced from the students. If students are allowed to design their own projects, it might result in an end product that does not meet the standard of work it should, especially since students would rather not complete work in the summer. Because of these issues and flaws, having student-design projects is not a wise choice.

Having teacher-designed projects is the best option for both teachers and students because it guarantees that students are working hard to meet the requirements of the assignment, comprehending the topic of the project, and working on projects that are both safe and school appropriate. In order for schools to ensure that students continue learning during their break, the most effective project for students to work on, is one designed by teachers.       ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The face on mars has been a topic for argument since its discovery in 1976. You might say that it is far to realistic to not have been created by intellegent life, but if there were any kind of alien carvings to sugest that, we would've seen it using the MGS image. We mush firmly conclude that the face was not created by any kind of inteligent extraterrestrial life form.

NASA released the photos originally to drum uo buzz aroung their programs. It worked most definitely, but the attention created sceptices. This led to NASA going out of their way to get a better shot of it, hopeing that this will silence the doubters, However this was a grueling task. Eventually though they found pretty substantial evedence that it was just a rock formation.

The face was initially discovered May 24, 2001 and ever since conspiracy theorists have run wild with the idea that it was made by aliens. The theory states that it was creatd by intelegent life, but NASA has been trying to cover it up and hide its true nature. As stated before this has no foundation because if Intelegent life was found on Mars if would only benifit NASA by drumming up a lot of money for research. Meaning the theory is unlikely.

Using advanced immaging they took pictures of the area that concluded the face was just a oddly shaped rock. However, it is a peculiar shape,but Middle Butte in Utah stands tall in a nearly barren landscape and that has been proven scientifc fact.

The face became something to rave about. It was such an important part in our pop culture that it even stared in a movie. The face will always facinate us. It is remerkable just how much the formation resembles a human face. Perhaps there will always be sceptics, but almost everything can be questioned. That is what is so great about humanity.

The face was not created by intelegent life. Even though that would be amazing. It is just a annother Martian mesa. The truth behind something like this might even be more miraculous than the fiction. Just think about how a planet can create something so beautiful without craftsmen and artisans for help. We may not know about aliens yet, but they certainly did not create this landform. But who is to say their isnt one that was created by aliens, the universe is a big place: anything is possible.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear, State Sentor

I feel that you should change to the popular vote for the President of the United States. That way they people can really choose who they want to be president instead of the government having to jump in and help the people choose who they want as president and some people dont vote because they know it doesnt matter.

With Electoral College the voters don't vote for a president, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For example the Jhon Kerry ''voting'' if you were in Texas you voted for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that pledged to John Kerry. The Electoral College is a process that makes voting easier for the government. They have to select electors, then they all have a meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and then the counting of the eletoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors. But a major of 270 electroal votes in order to elect the President. Another example John F. Kennedy had a popular that vote would have went to him.

The Electoral college is unfair to voters,because of the winner-take-all system in each state, the candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, which focuses only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It as become unfair,outdated,and irratonal. The electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism. We are in need of a change because this has been going on for years and years. So why not change it up i think it should have been done a while ago but it never to late.

The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Which is not every fair some people are'nt as rih as others so they sould'nt descrimate people by the way they look or dress. Because for all you know they look gurst so your not going to try and listen or understand where they came from. But they could be President material they just dont have the outter look, that everyones looking for.""Don't judge a book by it cover.""

The swing states go through the most with the electoral college,because its a winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as seen in election. Voters in toss up states are more likely to payclose attentionto the campaign. They get the most feed back for the government. Also they get attention from the candidates as while. The bigger states dont get much attention.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

I do not like the new school policy that you are proposing. Their are many reasons why, and I am glad to state them.

First of all, if most of your students have a grade C average, then they will not be able to play the sports or participate in the activities and you might not have enough students in your teams to play against other schools.

Secondly I understand that you think that if you change the school policy, then most of your students, at least the ones in sports and activities, will have a higher average, but what you didn't think about was that some of your students are trying their hardest and are only achieving a grade C average. It would be unfair to pull out that student from his/her sport or activity just because he/she is having a hard time in class.

I also believe that, you will be denying the collage education of some of these students that have a grade C average and are in a sport or in another activity. Those students that would have gone to collage due to their talents with sports or whatever activity that they were in, might not be able to go because of this new policy. You might be denying hundreds of students collage education just because of a school policy!!

Having a grade C average means that you understand it, your just not good at it. These students understand what the teacher is talking about, but they are just not good at it!

Thank you for taking your time to read my letter and I hope you take more time thinking about changing the school policy.

Sincerely,

"Dear senator,

I belive that we shouldn't keep the Electoral College. The election by popular vote is more fair for electing a president.

First off, going with election by popular vote is more fair. For example, in the article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" the author states, "" Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So,other things be equal, a large states gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" Its not fair that small towns/states gets less attention for the president because their opinion and votes dont really matter if they get less attention. Another reason for my argument is, ""Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in Califonia. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attentionto the campaign than they would have if the president we picked by popular vote.."" Proving that not many people have a say when voting.

In addition, the election by popular vote seems more better. For example, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but or a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Why is it that we arent actually voting for a president? That other people are technically voting for us. If we were to vote by popular vote people would actually feel like they are voting for who they want in office.""Consider that state legislatres are technically responsible for picking electors and that those people could always defy the will of the people."" So much time goes into election day but for what? We just vote for how we feel but not for who we vote for.

To conclude, people should feel like they have a say when voting. The Electoral College does not seem fair to others. Election by popular vote is way better and is more fair.                     ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Phones and Driving

Many people can argue that using a phone in any capacity while driving should not be allowed. However, it can also be argued that it is useful because phones can come in handy if your car were to break down if you could use the ""hands-free"" options and when it is used as a tracking device. Many people can argue that using phones are unsafe while driving but that is not necessarily true. You need to make sure that you use your phone wisely while driving, use it correctly and for the right reasons. There are many situations where phones should be allowed when driving especially when it comes to your safety.

Firstly, a reason why using your phone while driving is that it could be useful to make calls if your car has a problem or if you are in danger. If I were to be in an unsafe situation like if my car were to break down, and I did not have my phone with me, I would not have had a way to notify someone and get help in time. I would have to ask a stranger to use their phone, which could in fact put me in more danger since I would be putting my life in someone else's hands.

There are many apps on your phone that can help you in any situation you may get into like, ""Apps like iWrecked allow you to store and access all pertinent information, send a report, and access emergency resources with great ease and efficiency""(School). There is also a crash detecting ability that comes with the app Life 360 just in case of an accident, ""Crash detection uses patented technology to detect major collisions. It relies on sensors in your phone, like your accelerometer and GPS, to detect a significant impact whenever the vehicle is moving over 25 mph""(life). A lot of apps now don't even require you to press or swipe at anything to use them while driving.

Also, with the new hands-free accessories available, there is less danger involved since you are able to be less distracted since you are paying more attention to the road. ""Researchers analyzed accident and traffic citations for college students who claimed to use hands-free phones and those who used handheld devices in general. Both types of students were equally likely to wind up in car accidents. However, study participants with hands-free devices did receive fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than those with ordinary cell phones""(Housely).

You can use your phone as long as it doesn't interfere with your driving. ""A hands-free mobile phone can minimize such issues, allowing drivers to make calls without ever taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the steering wheel""(Housely). Another reason why hands free is a good idea is because there is a way for people to utilise their mobiles without looking at it while driving. Not only are phones easier to use with hands-free options, but they also can help you before you even swipe it open.

If I am ever in the need to go meet someone in a place that I've never been and I do not have access to a phone, I will not have a tracking device on me in case I get lost or someone is trying to get a hold of me in case there is no service. Although the phone may not have service, the tracker will allow my family to know where I am. This tracker isn't just useful for me it is also useful for my parents to know exactly where I am. Now there are different apps and programs available on most phones that help with tracking such as Life 360 and Find My iPhone. In life 360 there is also some sort of detection, and it helps when you've been in any sort of accident. ""Life360 crash detection is an automated service that knows when you've been in an accident, either as a driver or passenger, and asks if you're ok. If help is needed or you don't respond, life 360 will notify your circle members and emergency contacts on your behalf and share your exact location,""(life). This way they will have a location on me in case something happens. If you do not bring your phone, everyone would be searching for hours. In another instance, if I would not have access to a phone while I was being followed by someone, I would not be able to call the proper authorities to get help fast. On the apple website itself, it gives you brief information and you can install it, ""Apple receives this location information only when you locate your device, turn on Lost Mode, or enable Send Last Location. Location data is only retained for 24 hours so we can display the last known location of your device. Find My iPhone also automatically turns on Activation Lock, which requires your Apple ID to be entered before anyone can erase or reactivate your device""(Apple).

In conclusion, there were examples of different situations as to why phones should be allowed while driving. In the first example I explained how a phone would be handy when there is a car emergency. I also talked about how using the phone while driving can become less distracting when there is a hands-free option. And for safety reasons, there is a way for anyone to be tracked, if you are in danger. The majority of people think that not using your phone while driving is a better idea for safety reasons. These are a few reasons why driving with a phone at any capacity would be a lot more beneficial.

"Driverless cars would be good addition to the world. One of those reasons is that a smart can have better reaction times than a normal human driver. A smart car can also help with traffic jams. Smart cars also make sure the driver is holding onto the wheel and alert at all times.

Automakers used the speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock brakes. Those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Other improvements to make driving are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

BMW announced a smart car that can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. That means that the human driver must be alert at all times and be ready to take over when the situation requires.

A smart car can have better reaction times than a human driver and a smart car can help with traffic jams. Those are just two of the reasons why driverless cars are a good idea.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Facial Acting Coding System

In the article ""Making Mona LIsa Smile"" Nick D'Alto talls about a new technology named ""Facial Acting Coding System"", this type of new technology will identify your students emotions it will tell you if your studetns are happy, sad, angry or in fear. Teachers should be aware if students are understanding our class, if they are enjoying it and most important we shoould know if students are having raugh times in school or out of school.

In all schools there is studetns who half the time do not understand a lesson given by a teacher or electronic, students are embearrased to raise there hand and ask for help, students will rather miss the whole lesson and not understand than raise there hand and ask for the help they need. If we have the new ""Facial Action Coding System"" this would help studetns by grades, they would understand the subject and will be able to do their homework, test and quizzes with out a problem. so that means better grades.

Studenys will get bored during a class, when they get bored they will most likely not pay attention and wont do anything. If this technology were to be in classrooms this will help the teachers know when they are not focusing no moe, this would help teachers be better during a lesson. This will benefit the studetns from not paying attention.

Many teachers do not know there studetns. They do not know when students are going through something, if you look onlined the suicide percent is high because of bullying, bullying happens in every school. This technology will stop familys from loosing there kids to suicide. Teachers would be aware of studetns emotions and will get to know thre studetns more.

In conclusion this new technology will help all schools, teachers and stusdetns.         ",0,persuade_corpus,4

The article says there is a lot of war like things involved as well. It gets pretty dirty and rough to be a seagoing cowboy. I would suggest doing because it gives you oppertunities, and soemtimes it can be fun. You can't be weak and not willing to do work though. There is a lot of training to go through and it is not easy. So if your a hard working worker this is the place for you to be.

Then there are some severe injuries or even worse. You got to be tough though. I have a good time though. Beside the work, but sometimes it can be fun. You have company as well to cheer you up when your down. Some work you have to do is cleaning, feeding the animals, or even pulling or pushing heavy objects. Like in the article it said the animals have to be fed or watered two or three times a day.

Yet all the work there is fun. Like seeing all of the awesome landscapes or cities. If you feel down this will bring you up. Watching the sun set. Being with workers that are kind. There is more and more. It is just what kind of person you are. If you are a hard worker and like to see cool things. This is the place for you. It is really fun if you can see how it is fun to help people and animals. L hope this inspires you to be a seagoing cowboy. The program is great.         ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The author brings up many great ideas and facts about venus. In paragraph four the author says that venus and earth have a lot of the same physical features. The author brings up at one time venus could of had oceans. I think this is a false statement because the average tempature is 800 degrees. So I think all the water would evaporate over time. The author did bring up in pargraph four how venus had a lot of similar features like mountains,valleys and craters.

I dont think we should travel to venus my reasoning for that is in paragraph three the author states that the pressure is 90 times greater than earths and could crush metals.

"How should a summer project be designed to assure they continue learning over the break? While being asked to write should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed I contemplated over the thought and came to the conclusion there were a plethora ways to create a create a project that would be fine to give to the student over summer break but what's the best project that would make a student want to continue learning over the break? Student-designed projects should be the best option because it would give the student more control over what they decide their project to be and motivate them to continue their learning in a more productive way.

Student-designed projects engages a students mind more by giving them the ability to personalize their project more. The students will have a chance to bring more creativity into their education and be able to put more thought and ponder what they will decide to do with their summer project. Each project will have their own originality based on what each student desires to put in to their project with each person being very unique in their own way the outcome of each project will be interesting. The power of choice will let each student put more in their effort into the assignment because they will have a sense of ownership of their actions;furthermore,The students will take more pride in their work and their education for the summer project because they will feel that put a lot more of themselves in contrast to a teacher-designed summer project.

Student-designed based projects will be more beneficial to the school and our main purpose to make sure our students continue learning during their break. In most schools there will be a percentage of students who wouldnt do the project assigned to them because the project doesn't really enthuse the students. These students who do that see the project as a chore or work to do instead of something more exciting,while on break the students may feel that they want to forget school and education because they want to have fun and experience a nice break. Student-designed projects for the summer would convince the students that its something they can have fun doing and have a passion for learning and education. Student-designed projects benefits the students in the way that makes them want to learn instead of being forced.

Teacher-designed projects might have some benefits to the school to because they use a more stiff and secure design that would make it easier to grade for a large number of students this makes grading easier on the teachers because everybody is doing the same project designed by the teacher. The students will have a clearer guideline and more of a paved road to what they should do and the project may be much simpler to complete depending on the student and their needs because some students may prefer the teacher designing the project. It would be less time just to follow instructions instead of creating your own project by yourself and it would help some students get the project out the way and focus on their break;consequently,student-designed projects are overall more effective for getting students to continue learning during their break.

In conclusion,These summer projects should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed because it requires the students to display more creativity,originality,and take more pride in their personal project,in addition it will encourage more students in the right way to participate and lower the percentage of students who get assigned work but do not do it. student based learning also encourages students to learn by telling them to add their own passion and what they desire to do for the project,making students actually want to learn instead of being forced to do a assignment.          ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Driverless Cars

Creating driverless cars in the world seems like a big deal today. In all reality, having driverless cars around the world can be an accident just waiting to happen. If you really think about it, teenagers would most likely be the main ones buying driverless cars. Drinking while driving, texting, and falling asleep may accur when entering a driverless car. Is creating a car that drives on it's own really worth costing a life?

Drinking when driving is a huge mistake people tend to make. Giving them a car that works on its own, and allows you to sit there and get more drunk is not a very bright idea. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If you are drunk and the car alerts you to take control you may not even respond.

Texting and driving happens with anyone and everyone. People are way too focused on seeing what their friend sent them instead of paying attetion to the road. Alot of collisions have happend because of one driver texting and driving. "" Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters they need a whole lot of sensors."" Say those sensors just happend to suddenly cut off and not give any warning. How will a person know when to look up from their addictive phone?

Working hard days 24/7 can make a person extreamly sleepy. Say you get off of work and your exhausted, and a peaceful song comes on the radio. While listening to that song you fall into a deep sleep while your car takes you back to your house. ""Their cars have driven more than half a mile without a crash."" Maybe the test cars didn't have a problem with the driverless cars but what if somthing breaks in your car and it loses control? The sleepy driver is in deep sleep and could die from the driverless car manufacturing.

In conclusion, having a driverless car does not make the world any safer nor better. It gives people a better chance to drink and drive, text and drive, even sleep and drive. How is making driverless cars anysafer yet better to the world?

He used NASA's Viking 1, and saw an object that appeared to be a face. He got a closer look later in his career, and it was not an actual face. This was later taken by surprise by the general public, and they still thought that it had to be a real sign of life on Mars. Because of this research, I believe that the face is just a natural landform. Three reasons why I believe this is true are that NASA's research has proven this, photographs taken by NASA have shown that this is true, and comparisons to landforms on Earth have shown the public that this is the truth.

My first reason for stating my opinion would be that NASA's research has proven that the Face is a landform. An example of this from the text would be that NASA has published many photos of the Face to show the public that it was just a landform. To further explain this, if you look close enough at the pictures in this passage, then you can see it is a landform. It may look like a face from a far distance, but evidence given by NASA has shown that this is not the case.

My second reason for this is the fact that NASA has taken many photographs of this landform to prove it is true. Here is a quote from the text that shows this: ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Later in this paragraph, it states that the picture has proven that there was not an alien monument. Secondly, as people stated, it was a cloudy day in Mars, so they were not satisfied with the picture. So, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Later in the paragraph, Garvin, an expert that works with NASA, says this: ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Even though it wasn't cloudy, the team of NASA got the same result: it is just a landform.

My last reason would be that comparisons to landforms on Earth have proven that this is true. Garvin says in paragraph twelve that ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" What this is saying is that there have been similar landforms on Earth that are on Mars. Scientists can use this data to compare different pieces of landforms on different planets. Using this, they can figure out what the Face actually is, and other mysteries that they come up against.

Some people may have used to say that the picture was too blurry to make out what the Face actually was. However, NASA has taken many clear photos of the Face, and they have proven several times that it is not an alien artifact, and that it is only a landform on the surface of the planet.

So, what do you think now? Do you still believe that the Face is an ancient artifact? Well, you should not anymore after reading this; the evidence given here in this essay clearly shows that the Face is just a landform. Scientists like Gerald and Garvin have shown this a repeated amount of times. So, in conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, and not proof of life on Mars.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hi I am a scientist at NASA discussing the face on Mars with Jacob that thinks that the face was created by ailens. I will explain to Jacob that the face was not created by aliens beacuse us sientist figured that it was just another Martian mesa wich is commen around Cydonia but only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like it had a face. Our caption noted a huge rock formation wich made it look like a human face. Some authors reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars by saying that aliens had created that human face on Mars.

We sent out a Global Surveyor to see and take a picture of the ''face"". It arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997 18 years after the Viking mission ended. It would get a photo as soon as It can get it. When Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Mihael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they took the photo thousands of web surfers were waiting to see the image. When they saw the image they saw that it was only a land form. There was no alien monument after all.

As you can see if there where objacts in this picture like a house or something else you would be able to see it on this picture. What the picture actually shows is a Martian butte or mesa that are landforms commen around the American west. It remids me of the Middel butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho.

"The emotion reading tech called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), should be in class rooms. This can help the teacher's make a bettter invirment for their student. This is because most of the time student will hide their emotins to keep people or things out. The tech can also be used to help the police intragating bad people.

The FACS should not be in any class becuase it gets to emotion that people don't want out. The FACS use ""all 44 major muscles."" This can help it make gussess on th ""six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" Beside you can how someone is ""feeling simply by the look on her face.""

If FACS were allowed to be in classes it could help the teacher's or instructors. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang Predicts. ""Then it coud modify the lesson, like an effective human instructors."" This will allow the teacher's to take action that can improve the student state of emotion. The FACS would be a overall benefit for both student and teachers alike.

The FACS can also help people that can't speak. Most of the time, when talking to people who are in need. We can't really tell what they are think. In this artical, the FACS can tell emotions made by people. Not only can the

FACS tell the six basic emotions, it ""can even identify mixed emtions.""

The FACS should be in classess. This is because it can make a better place for many people. It can help people who are in need and teacher and student too. This FACS can change the way we look at the people around us. It can also help us to understand other people better as well.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Seagoing Cowboys is a program that people recommend you join and this is why. Luke Bomberger is trying to convince others to join the Seagoing Program because you get to help peolpe in need,experience new things,and visit tourist sites in different areas.

First,you should join this because you get to help peolpe in need. Luke helped people after World War II was over in Europe recover their food supplies, animals,and much more. Another way that he helped is he took care of people's horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas by himself.

Secondly, you can experience new things. Luke first took care of the animals on a ship and after that he was a night watchman. On the boat he got to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed with the cowboys. He also got to do table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and other games.

Lastly,you an visit tourist sites. Luke got to visit an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. He also got to take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Lastly,on his way he got to see the Acropolis in Greece.

Now you can see why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. From helping people in need, experiencing new things, to visiting tourist sites. Now you know what program you can join after hgih school, in the future.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In today's society pretty much, everyone has a smart device like a tablet or a computer or a phone. People mainly use their phone more than anything to do pretty much everything like look something up on google or play a game take a picture make calls for work or to meet up with a friend and update social status and most importantly texting. Texting is a problem with people especially with young people, they never look up so they might walk into a pole or something but when it comes to driving, not even the law can stop them from telling their friend that they are on I-85 30 minuets away and that accident usually doesn't look pretty. Some companies like apple have put a driving mode on all their devices to prevent any notifications from appearing, some car companies have made it to where you pair your phone to your car and you can use voice commands to send texts and make calls and change your song and that helps some people.

People who are addicted to their phone and cant put it down shouldn't be allowed on any big roads unless they can put it down because accidents can happen in a second or two and a humans reaction time is 0.25 seconds which if you don't have your phone you can turn the wheel out of the way or hit the brakes but it takes you a second to put down your phone and half a second to look up and process what is happening and in total that's 1.50 seconds which means you lost your time to react and you have hit something or another car. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries and 1 out of 4 of those accidents is caused by texting and driving. It is better to have your passenger do your texting for you or tell when to make your next right turn so you can look at the road ahead and stay clear of any accidents. Over all drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving, it would reduce the amount of accidents each year and make the roads safer for other people.     ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I disagree, because students should have the choice to do a extracurricular activity. Some students don't like doing sports or putting there self out there. Also some people are not good at sports. Alot people are scared because they don't want people as in students and teachers to make fun of them. Some kids are way too nervous to even get up in class and do a persontation. So I don't that students would be intressted in doing things that they know their not good at. if students are told to do something their not good at they will feel embrassed.

Students that are good at art should participate in that yearbook, if they want too. I don't think that students should be told to do something that they don't want to do. Students should not be preasured into doing things that they are not good at. If students are preasured into doing things they won't do their best. Because they will feel like they have to be perfect for everyone. But students should be encouraged into doing these things. But they should not be required to do activties.

When it comes to .P.E. every athletic students takes it so serious as if it's the NBA. For example if a class is doing basketball. And one persom does not make it into the hoop. everyone in the room will yell at him/her. The person that was shooting didn't make it in because he/she was preasured into getting the ball into the hoop. Some students are not good at any sport so therefore it should be a choice to participate in activities. Also even if someone is amazing at art they shouldn't be told to participate in the yearbook if they don't want too. some student's don't want to participate in student council, sports, and the yearbook. so it should be a choice to participate or not. Not everyone is brave enough to do these things. Student council is a pretty big thing that should be a choice to be involved in.

Student council can sometimes make students nervous because they help make decsions sometimes. They coul fall under the line of being really nervous. Because if they make the wrong decsions then everyone might get mad at him/her for not making the decsion they wanted. Being student council is not a bad thing it's just a pretty big deal. Because the student can be put under alot of preasure and stress. Too be as perfect as everyone wants the student to be. Like I said it is still the students coice is participate in student council or not.

Every activity should be a choice. Not everyone is good at sports, the yearbook, and being student council. No one should be forced into doing anything they don't want too do. Everyone has a choice to do something. No one should be forced to do a activity.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"This essay was about exploring Venus. this essay was interesting because it talks about space and one of our important planets. although Venus is sometimes called the ''Evening Star'' is can have dangers as well. The author was talking about how Venus is the second planet from the sun which means it can be very hot. I think this planet would be fun too research.

There can be dangers going to venus. He stated in the past aa previous mission didnot survive the landing for more than a couple of hours. ''Not a single spaceship has touched down on venus for more than three decades''. I think that it is ok to do research on venus. But I believe that it is way too dangerous to go too beause people who went to venus never returned home.

This author gave lots of helpful details on how to study venus. Some of his details included electronics made of silicon carbide simulating the chaos of venus surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions. You can also read books or watch movies about Venus. He also said NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. I think some of these studies are neat.

Despite the dangers this author thinks it's very cool to study venus even though there are dangers. He gives lots of his opinions on what is going to happen. He talks about how NASA has the idea of sending humans to go study venus. Which I personally don't think that is a good idea. If they can figure out the right equipment then I could agree with that.

Overall the author did a great job explaning about NASA and venus. Venus is a very ''hot"" planet and would be very interesting to study. I liked how he talked about this topic. I think next he should talk about another planet. This is how I feel about this topic.         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
You should go with policy number one because students should have time to use their cell phones during school but not during class time. The reason why not during class time is because no one will pay attention to you when you are teaching because they will be texting. They should use it during their free time because what is the use having a cell phone if you can't use it during school. I don't have a cell phone because there is no room on the plan for me right now because I have five sisters and four brothers. In my school you are aloud to bring your cell phones but you can't use it at all in school. People should be able to bring and use their cell phones in their spare time.

"I agree with the principal because I think the students should do one activity. The students sould do it because they would be nothing when doung nothing in life so that's why they should do the activity's at school. I think that the activity's the students are doing is amazing becuase I want to do those things at school. I think that all the students should do sports because it is fun to do.

Next, I want all the students to be sucessful and life so they should do the activity's at school to be something when they grow. You can't be nothing if you just sit around all day so if they really love the activity they should folow their dreams. If they love sports they can play sports if they love to be a student council they can be a student council so never stop following your dream.

Then, I want the audience to agree with me. I think that the principal did a amazing job of thinking about this and i like the idea of it. I wise that my principal will think about this and do it because it would be fun and that i wll love it.

In conclusion, you can tell that I agree with the principal about one activity and I think that the students should do it and that it is a great idea becuase i would do it. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Many high school teachers will assign summer assignments and projects for their new students to do before starting their class whether it be AP biology or algebra I. I believe that these summer assignments should be teacher designed because they know the curriculum a lot better than the students would, the students could take advantage of to opportunity to create their own assignment, and it would put less stress on the student to have the assignment already made for them that they would just have to complete.

Teachers are specialized in all of the subjects they are teaching students. They have taught these courses time and time again, and therefore know what materials and objectives students should understand when coming into their class or the first time. It is beneficial that a student has a little bit of background knowledge on the class they will now be taking. For example, going into a math class such as advanced functions and modeling, the teacher expects the student to know some algebra I and II, so he or she might give them a packet with some algebra to keep the student refreshed and prepared. Having a student design their own project to allow there to be analysis of the wrong information that may not be necessary to know for the class they soon will be taking. Or, the student does not go deep enough into the right kind of information.

If a student was given the opportunity to create their own summer project, that could go two ways: The student actually puts forth effort and creates a well done assignment, or the student takes advantage of the opportunity to make their own assignment and would create a project that would not benefit them in any way due to lack of effort. Many high school students, like myself, will put in the bare minimum of effort when told to do an assignment, or do anything for that matter. Having the project made for the student allows for the student to do research and find the answers to problems that may be on it. Since the student is not familiar with the subject they are doing the project for, they could lack the information needed in their project to actually grasp the subject as a whole as well. For example, if a student were to be assigned to create a project for history, they could do a paper on an individual they already know in and out. If a teacher were to assign a historical figure to a student, that could be an opportunity for the student to learn about a whole new individual they may not have known anything about initially.

Having a project or assignment already created for the student could relieve a little bit of stress on their summer vacation. Students may be assigned more than one project to do during the summer for a variety of classes they may be taking. Having to design their own projects and then proceed to complete the projects they have outlined for all of their classes could be quite stressful on the student. It summer after all, so students should have a little break to enjoy it. Having the projects already set up and ready for them to complete it would make the life of the student more livable.

You could argue that having the student design their own projects allows them to have some discipline and order for how they spend their time, but it is summer time! Let the kids live it up for a couple months, they will be right back in to the stress of school right back in August.

Summer is a time to allow students to relax and enjoy their vacation. Yet, they do have to keep some curriculum fresh in their minds with the help of summer assignments and projects while other knowledge rushes away through time. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers so that it is beneficial information being absorbed by the student, the work is thorough and stretches the mind of the student, and allows the student to stay in the know with the right information without it being to overwhelming with having to design their own project.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The U.S. has been using the Electoral College for a long time.  I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?  Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is.  I dont think popular vote would get us a good president, people would pick the one who makes those promises that will only be good for a short time.  The U.S. needs a president who can asure us we wont have to worry about everybody losing there jobs soon or not being able to pay for gas because its up to $4.00 a gallon.

Its a very time managed process, its not like they take some names, write them on a piece of paper, mix them up in a hat, and grab the first one you feel.  How big of a mistake would that be? Electoral College even sounds like a well thought out idea, for one it has the word college in it and college is where you get a better education for your future.  When electing a President you want to know that you will have a good future with the president that is elected.  Just because the Electoral College is old doesnt mean it isnt a good process.

Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actuallt gone to Kennedy.)

Voting for the next President of the United States isn't something you would just want to rest in the hands of popular votes, you could end up with someone who doesnt even know what he is doing, or even desides he can't handle all of the responsibility of being the President.  I feel very strong about my thoughts on the subject and believe that the Electoral College is still the way to go.               ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a once-in-a-lifetime trip that will change your life, just like it did mine. It was a spontaneous change of my life! I had a great time knowing that all the work I was doing was saving lives and helping others, and it made me look at things at a whole different perspective. I still learned more about livestock, even though I am a small-town farm-boy. I learned that life isn't perfect for everyone, and that I was taking my living conditions for granted. These things have made me a better person.

It moved me to see all of these people living in ruins. Tatthered clothing, rubble everywhere, mass graves, dead/injured livestock, and people were starving to death. The Seagoing Cowboys got over to Europe (and Asia) and reversed a lot of this. It came to my attention that we, Americans, are taking our lives for granted. This was a relatively easy realization to make, as things are in ruins.

I am more sensitive to problems people have and now know that I'm an animal-person. I now look at things through a more ""maybe it's worse"" perspective. This has made me a better friend, better man, and more well-liked. I have made no regrets since my return. I think that once you see someone living in these conditions, you reach out to everyone a little more.

If I could, I would do it again! If you try this, you will leave knowing you made a difference. The people who save lives doing this are heroic. They were brave enough to go to Europe/Asia and make a difference. I highly recommend you to take part in this program. Wars don't happen very often, after all!            ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Phones & Driving

Isn't driving a vehicle without cellular devices distracting and stressful enough?? I can go ahead and explain why driving with a cell phone is not the right thing to do. It is also not the safest idea. Most of the world's population are using these devices while driving but don't realize, that to operate a vehicle it always takes two hands, at all times. So many things could go wrong at any time while driving even without these dangerous devices. No matter how far or how short of a distance you are traveling it does not make a difference.

The generation we are barely living through in todays society, these people don't think about anyone but their selves. During this process, you don't only place yourself in life or death situation, you are also harming others and even the people around others. Driving while operating an electronic device is more than illegal in my point of view. Once, a family member of mine suffered and literally died during a car crash and this entire situation never involved a cellular device. That shows there is no need to add another hazard behind the wheel. Especially around others.

Personally, the first step I take after entering a vehicle, is slapping that seatbelt on and placing my phone in my pocket after choosing music. Always do your personal process before you take the vehicle out of park. Cellular devices never became an issue until all of these smart phones were produced. The whole reason the government are making all of these newer, electronic, and way smarter is to prevent humans from using their cell phones while driving. One more thing to think about, is the larger the population grows, the more of this problem will grow and go on and on and on for generations.

In my opinion, I think all these people that are driving, and operating cell phones, are just not experienced enough to drive at all. If you have ever been in any kind of accident behind the wheel, you should know that the littlest mistake can make the biggest difference. The feeling after that, just the adrenaline shoots through the roof. Once these people have made those mistakes, they would learn the lesson that is waiting for them in the future. If your one of the people that drive while on your cell phone, then you need to rethink if you really want to risk your life. It will happen, sooner or later, driving while using a cell phone is not okay, so it will happen. Even to the best of us. Do not drive while operating a cellular device. It is against the law, and it may cause serious injury and possibly death.!             ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Every child leads a different life and is born into a different environment

- but the one thing that every child deserves is the chance to receive a quality education. People across the globe have fought for this vital opportunity for decades, advocating for those whose path to knowledge is obscured by circumstance. Students who have obstacles such as mental health issues or the lack of local education would greatly benefit and be better accommodated from the opportunity to take classes online and from their home.

A system of at-home classwork would greatly help any student with a learning disability or intellectual setback. Many children struggle with slight disabilities such as dyslexia or ADHD - small occurrences that hinder the learning process. However, these minuscule variations can have major effects on the way a student absorbs information and needs to be accommodated in the classroom, a setback that many public schools aren't equipped to handle. This can prove detrimental to the development of the student - without the proper instruction formatted for the style in which they learn, their true academic potential can remain untapped. With classes taken inside the home, this can change. In the environment they know best, surrounded by people that understand how they need to be aided, the child can thrive without the pressure to adapt to the method of learning endorsed inside the mainstream school. They can explore options in their education and take the time they need to properly understand new concepts, all within their home and without the restraint of a larger public entity telling them to conform.

Students that don't have access to public education in the areas in which they live would highly benefit from the ability to take online classes. While a rarity, there are some areas of the globe where young people are denied the chance to receive an education. This is nearly never the fault of the student - where they live, the government of the country that they live in, and their gender or physical appearance are all traits that they cannot control. When the terrorist group Al-Qaeda was present in Pakistan, many Pakistani girls couldn't go to school or leave their houses due to the militia's belief that women were not deserving of rights or an education. While these girls were being denied the opportunity to be educated, this doesn't mean that they weren't deserving - online classes could've and still could improve that situation. Through the availability of methods to access classwork in the home, children that have been circumstantially denied the chance to attend school could be granted that chance again, and with potentially less risk. Classes taken within the home would allow students in difficult life situations to gain back their opportunity to learn, and continue furthering their intellectual development despite their circumstances.

Anxiety can severely stunt the educational career of a budding child, but would be lessened through the attendance of classes from home. Anxiety can infiltrate every corner of a student's thought process, and whether the stress is academically related or not, it affects the way that a child learns and grows. Participation grades, group projects, popularity expectations, and the rumor mill of regular public school can take a more severe toll on children with anxiety disorders, making it hard for these students to see school as a place to gain knowledge. Instead, they begin to dread it, sick and tired of the constant pressure and nervousness they experience in the classroom. However, when attending classes within the home, these judgments can be alleviated. The anxiety within the student is eased by being in a familiar environment, a place where they can decide what interactions to engage in and when. An opportunity like at-home classes can transform an anxious child's perspective of education from a negative and stressful experience into something positive and beneficial, helping them progress academically while accommodating to their mental health.

The opportunity to receive at-home education and attend classes through an online program would provide important accommodations to students that otherwise feel out-of-place in the regular public school system, namely those with mental setbacks or difficult geographical circumstances. While it is a privilege and would most likely take time to implement, the chance for a personalized education is a chance that all children deserve. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"My opinions are if the students have wife access from their homes i think that they can attend classes from home. That is the best way to do some work for example projets or homeworks if their teachers give them to do. Also i think that students would benefit because there is something they may be learning how to get it done, and they will have time free to work on it. For the video confering most of the students don't like to do too much work because they are lazy sometimes, and they prefer the easy way to get it done quickly.

I know why i say all this because i am a student, and i also know how things work when we have some classes online. most of students feel great, and some of them don't like to work on it at home.

"This generation is influenced by technology and they are used to it. They would be more comfortable with it as they are used to it . It's beneficial for students to do distant learning more than to go to school and do it.

Distant learning is already being used through online and video conferencing, This days colleges and universities allows students to choose online courses of their own choices . Students are used to online stuff like, web browsing, gaming, and etc. which gives them an extra advantage already. They would be more successful using online browsing. Video conferencing is another way of distant learning; this would let the teachers talk to students in case they need help. People has been using video conferencing to even take tests at home.

Distant learning would also help them have success in education socially. If students are to stay at home to learn, they would feel more comfortable around somewhere they been for a long time. They could ask people, family members who they are comfortable with, for help if they wanted to. They would be more fit and ready than going to school considering that you have to wake up early in the morning, get ready and walk to school. They wouldn't have to do any of this, and have enough sleep to have a fresh mind to work with.

It is beneficial for students to use distant learning to attend classes such as, video conferencing and online browsing.

I am a student at you school and I have had some concerns on the phone policy. I have some ideas and suggestions on things that can be added or changed to the policy.

I think that all students should be able to carry their phones, but only in lunch, study halls, ands in hall ways. I think that if any student is caught with their phones in class they should get their phones taken away for the rest of the day. The students should get their phones back at the end of the day. Another thing is if they are caught three time the student should get a detention. I think that if you enforce those rules there will be less texting in class, less cheating, and it may raise grades because of the increase attention in class.

There are many reasons why the students need their phones. some of the students have their parents working and can not communicate with anyone in case of emergency , others have after school activity, others also have to call their parents to pick them up.

Many people will suggest to have the students go to the office to call their parents. That will only lead to packed offices. There may also be emergency that restrict people of getting out of the office.

There are lots of reasons why you may want the students not to have their phones but my opinion is that the reasons why they should have their phones out way the other reasons. In my opinion and all of my research that I personally did i think that the best choice would to let all of the children have there phones.

sincerely, your student",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Their are so many things you can do to help keep the envierment safe to live in. Some countys world wide have already started taking these procations to protect the earth. The thing these countries have decided to change in their everyday life is to take cars away or start limiting the use of them. Now this might sound like a big deal but their are many advantages to this appeal of motor use.

Some advantages of cars being limited or just not used at all, would mean we would be saving more money. Just think about all the money you throw away to put it towards your car. Their are bills, repairs, new car if you get into a bad acident, ect. The list just goes on and on. Their could be so much more you could spend your money on and it could make are economy richer.

In source 3: car-free day is sprinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky it states that "" In Bogota people who violated the car usage would be faced witha fine of $25"". This is another way of showing you how much money you are wasting on your car.

Another advantage to not owning or using a car would be the pollution levels in the earths atmosphere would go down. In sourse 2:paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer it states that ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a parital driving ban to clean the air of the global city"". Now the people of the world should have never let pollutin get this bad. The french more of paris had smog (a type of pollution) for at least a week. In sourece 4: the end of the car culture by Elizabeth Rosenthal it states that ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was on January 1995"". So the cars limitations is actually helping lower the number of miles which means the pollution rate is also going down.

Their are many advantages to not using or at least limiting the use of a car. such as reducing the money that is spent on one which wouls help the economy out. Also reducing the the polluction that cars produce. These are just some of the small advantages that come with the reduction and limitations of cars in the world we live in today.                                  ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The author struggles to explain the advantages of what will happen if NASA explores Venus. It is close to impossible with the technology out right now for NASA to be able to explore Venus.

It is really worth spending years and millions of dollars to build a spacecraft that will tell NASA about Venus. We do not even know if the spacecraft will even make it there knowing that the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbob dioxide. The auothor of this excerpt thinks it will happen. In the excerpt ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states ""each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, sice no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (Challenge). Landing spacecrafts on the Venus is almost impossible. There is too many factors that NASA will not be able to figure out for the next fifty years. Also the author says ""today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"" (Challenge). One of the major reasons why people still want to explore Venus is because astronomers believe that it was once covered in oceans.

This program it not a great idea, they need to take away this program and make sure student come to school to learn more then being in home.

"How do you use your cell phone the most? To text some or use the calculator? To call someone or check the date? A cell phone definitely comes in handy in some everyday situations, but is it necessary to use it in school when all of the tools that you need are handed to you? These are questions that most students don't really ask themselves. They complain about not being able to use their phone in school, but why do they need to use it? So does a cell phone immediately turn into a distraction as soon as it hits a school campus?

Now, I'm as much of a kid as the next guy, and I use my cell phone probably just as much, but I've never needed it in a school situation unless I was just plain lazy. People say that they wouldn't use their cell phone to text in school, but to use it as a resource. Well, when a student sneaks and uses their cell phone in class, are they using it to solve the question in front of them or telling their friend how bored they are at the moment? My point exactly. Rarely is a cell phone taken out for a helpful use. Also, if cell phones are legalized in the school system, then how often would cell phones get used then? With out the danger and risk in using a cell phone, the students won't find much of a use for them then.

Another argument might be that they need to call/text their mom to inform her of something that's extremely important. Well, if it's something of that nature of emergency, then that's why there is such thing as an office phone. If your sick, ask if you can go to the clinic, then the clinic will diagnose you, then give you the option to call your mom and ask anything that you may need to ask. Why permit cell phones when you have an already functional process at hand? Same goes with if you need something dropped off at the school.

"Despite driverless cars not being able to be absolutely driverless the vehicles still are able to do actions that human beings would not be able to do. Such as use less gas while driving, and still haul more people. Driverless cars will, in the long run, cut out the workers who drive for a living, like taxi drivers or semi drivers. Those workers may be able to still work for the company, but work on the car instead of in it. In the end driverless cars use half the fuel as a human would while driving a vehicle and use less money for the cost of gas. The conclusioin that companies would have to also think about is that employers do not have to pay their employees, who previously had to drive, as much because the drivers would not be driving anymore.

While the driverless vehicles are using les gas, that is an added bonus for the economy because the United States would have to buy less oil form the Middle East causing the U.S to have more money to pay back the trillion dollars of debt that is currently owed. Also the less fuel being put out of vehicles will help the ecosystem and the O-Zone by helping restore it and keeping Global Warming less of a threat to the world. The vehicles will be ""more flexible than a bus,"" meaning that the automobiles will hold more people, use less gas, and get places quicker and safer. The automotives will still be able to have a human driver, but only when needed. Such as in necessary times as a traffic jam, or if there is road work ahead.

The driverless cars are not just as safe or more safe than a car being driven by a person. The driverless cars have ""driven more than half a million miles without a collision."" Today so many teen drivers get into collisions with other drivers because of distractive devices. Where the are driverless carsare without a person and just a piece of technology, the technology will not have the temptation of picking up a cell phone or radio device. Also many popular car brands are making their own type of driverless cars such as General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan who all plan of having the vehicles be sold out tothe general public.

Many American people watch television about futureistic devices and lifestyles including driverless cars. Car manufactures saw what the people wanted and decided to help make that dream become reality. Although the title says ""driverless cars"", it is not entirely true. The vehicles will still have a human opporator, but the human will not be one hundred percent involved in the driving. In the end the cars will be little to not dependent on the human att all just when there is unwanted road adviseries ahead.

Some new laws will have to come with the production of the new driverless cars but all good things must have a few boundries. Some new laws may include who will be at fault if someone gets injured if the vehicle collides with another car or pedestrian. Although right now it is unclear who will be held responsible if there is an injury or death caused from the automobile, many discussions are being thought out by the car companies. The big question of liability right now is who will be heald responsible the manufacturer or the driver? Depending on the given situation that question will remain unsolved until it can be tested out and argued on both sides.

Although some people may not believe in the idea of a driverless car, it has many more positives than negatives. The car will use less gas, helping the ecostystem and the economy. Use less money on gas, saving people many dollars on taxes and helping the U.S out of debt. Hold more people, helping people get places quicker and safer if someone is to drive. Lastly the cars have less threats of getting destracted as a normal human would. Therefore driverless cars can only help the average person by saving money, being safer, and using time more affectively.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"State Senator,

I strongly believe in canceling the Electoral College. Not only does this process make us believe we are voting for the president when in reality we are just sending our votes to a bunch of electors, but it also isn't entirely trust worthy. Sometimes a voter can get confused about the elector and vote for the wrong candidate. If there happens to be a tie in the votes, the election is moved to the House of Representatives. The tie could mean that the House's selection wouldn't meet the standards to make the people happy. The Electoral College system is really unfair to it's voters. This system called the winner take all system makes candidates move away from states they have no chance of winning.

The Electoral College is not fair to it's voters, out of date, and irrational. Peoples arguments about it are mostly just assertions without reality on their side. I mean, why have we not changed this system yet? The votes get sent to electors, not the president. We've been using this system for a long time, it's not accurate, trust worthy, or modern. America is all about change. How are we going to change if we hold on to the same voting system? We don't.

In Hawaii 1960, two slates of electors were sent to congress. Richard Nixon luckily validated the opposing sides electors. If this happens again it can end badly. In the same year, segregationists almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with brand new ones that were against John F. Kennedy. With this, a popular vote towards Kennedy would never have gotten to him. Also, faithless electors usually refuse to vote for their candidate and vote for whoever.

If possible, get rid of this system. History has proven that The Electoral College has to many flaws. It needs to be taken care of.

"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in my opinion i dont believe aliens are real. Here are the reasons why i think the Face on Mars has become just a natural landform.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a pictue ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for that image. When the image appeared on a JPL web site revealing just a natural landform peopole finally knew that there was no alien monument after all.

Another reason why i think The ''Face on Mars'' is just a natural lanform because, ''The Face on Mars'' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!

Some people think the Face is evidence of life on mars.

April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum resolution.

As a rule of thumb, you can turn things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small item, you would be able to see what they were!

In this argumentative essay i have tried to convince people that the Face is just a natural landform.  ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I think that it is a great idea that students should be required to have at least a B average in order to participate in extra curricular activities. This will motivate the students to do better in school, give them something positive to look forward to, and it would make the school look better.

If the students are required to have a B average this will motivate them to better in school. If they want to participate in sports and other activities, they will do better in school. In general, if a person really wants something, they will be willing to work for it. In this case, the students will be forced to keep watch on their grades. This will in turn give them a noticeable reward for their hard work.

This will also give students something positive to look forward to. 35% of all American students have negative influences around them when they leave school. So to come to a school and work for something, is a big thing for them. They will look forward to coming to school and getting something done to make a difference in their lives. I also think that this will lower the percent of drop outs in SCHOOL_NAME and help to make us a better community.

If you follow through with this choice, it will also make the school look better. You may ask, ""How so?"". Well as of now 45% of our students are failing at least 3 classes, and a recent survey shows that 95% of SCHOOL_NAME students like to play a sport and enjoy the activities held after school. If you require them to have a B average, they will get better grades in order to do what they want to do.

So to wrap things up, I think that requiring a B average of all students wanting to participate in any extra curricular activities is a great idea. After all, it will give students something positive to look forward to, it will motivate them to get better grades, and it will have a positive impact on our school. The way I look at it, everybody wins. You get a great school and the students get to grow up a little. I hope that you take this into consideration.

Thank You,

"dear principle

I have heard that your new rule was that students have to have a B average to play sports I disagree with this rule because first sports can keep kids healthy and not over weight secondly I believe that sports is a way to get students mind off of school.

The reason I think sports is should be a priority is because they keep you healthy and if kids are over weight they will probably be made fun of.

Secondly school may be overwhelming for some students and when they get home they just do more overwhelming homework so if they have sports to go to that would get there mind of school and get it refocused then they will be more prepared.

This is the reasons I think that in order to play spots you have to have a B average is the wrong rule to apply to our school.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think this issue have benefits, advantages, and disadvantages because it is a good option firstly, to people that have disabilities because they are not able able to attend school as the others students for the reasons that is to difficult and dangerous to them because of their conditions and the routine that schools have.

Moreover, classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a good option to those students that are persons that leave school at early age for any reasons and now they are older that want the opportunity to continue school, classes from home can give to them that opportunity to finish school, to learn something that they are interesting, a specific subject that they want to develop like: art, play any instrument, mathematics. Also, to learn something that help them for work like: mechanic, cosmetology, or computation.

In addition, classes from home can be benefit for those students that have biggest responsibilities as a student that have to work because of have a family that need him or a student that get pregnant, she is not able to attend school for the circumstances that will be dangerous for her and her baby however, classes from home can gives her the opportunity to continue and not stop with her goal to finish school.

Furthermore, classes from home have advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages that I think that classes from home are: the student can take classes in his comfort from home, do not get frustrated, and take the classes at any time he want. I think classes from home have disadvantages because the student not will learn in the same way as the others and that will affect them because of they will not get the same knowledge, the opportunity to be sociable, and express their ideas to others.

Thus, I conclude that classes from school is a good option for those students that want study but for some reasons they are not able to attend school, some reasons like disabilities, older that cannot go to school as others young student, students that have a work and biggest responsibilities, or a student that going to be mother. this will offer the opportunity to continue studying. however, attend school from home have disadvantage as to share and be sociable with others.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Seeking more than one opinion can lead you to make better choices because of a multitude of reasons these are just three.

First and foremost there is usually more than one way to do one thing, if you ask for more than one opinion chances are that you will find the easiest way to accomplish your goal. Second you are most likely not the first one to face this problem so if you ask for multiple opinions you will most likely find some one who had this problem before you and they will have the answer then with multiple answers you can choose the best one from the bunch. The last reason is all about information if know one has the answer then they will at least have information to give if you have all the knowledge you need you will make the best answer.

My first reason is that there is more than one way to do just about anything so if you ask for multiple opinions than you may discover the easiest way.

I personally do not know every thing so when I have a question a ask multiple people. Now with that in mind I am also lazy so I like to take the easiest way out when I find all of the information that I need, I pick the easiest way so this way I do not have to do much if any work and I get the my question solved correctly. although most of my questions and problems stop with grandma who I have a lot of respect for. She is vary wise and old because she is so old she has gone through most of my problems and more.

Speaking of old, wise, and problems that's our next topic.

The second reason I have is that people before you have probably faced the problem you have know. So if you were to ask for more than one opinion from the people who have done this before you. Then you should get a collection of different answers so from that you just pick the best one. For example in the sixth grade I had to do a history project on an important time period the United States of America so i choose world war two. My only problem was I didn't know any details about the war so I went to the oldest person I knew my Grandma while we were talking about it some other old people overhead us talking (read eavesdropped on us) so I got there opinions as well. So because I got multiple opinions I got more information than i had origanily hoped for. I had so much information in fact that I didn't choose just one I took the best from all of them and made my own, and that brings us to our finial topic.

The last topic of the day is that when you get more opinions than just one you get more information to better choose your answer, because when you have more information you make better designs.

When I don't know a thing about what I am saying I tend to make pore decisions but when am knowledgeable I make good decisions.

A example of that is when i wanted to go swimming in a pond once i did not know there were leaches in there so when i went swimming i got a leach (I named him bill until I figured out he was a bad thing then I screamed for mom) it was not a good idea. two years later i was going to go swimming in another pond but then i remembered ""Oh wait what if this pond has leaches so I did my research no leaches it has snakes though I think I will just read a book instead.""

See when you have information you make good choices.

their is more than one way to do any thing if you ask around you will find the easiest way. your elders have done this before they usually have an answer for you so ask them in fact ask several of them. having information helps you make the best choice possible the best way to get information is to ask multiple sources and opinions. When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This why asking for multiple opinions is a great way to make the best decision possible.   ",0,persuade_corpus,1

Fisrt it starts off when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; yes it is like the that one movie we've all seen Joy. Even the smallest smile you give can indecate how you are feeling. For example when you smile people think are happy; when you fake smile people stillthink you are happy even though you might either be happy, sad, or mad. Or some people don't even have a smile and people think that they are mad even though they could be happy, some people just don't like showing it.

There are many reason why people may not like showing how they really feel, some people don't like showing it because they may think they look weak. It is fine showing your emotions. Maybe they can let people know how they are feeling and it will get a lot better to let everything out, some kids don't like telling their parents how they feel, so maybe they can talk to a teacher who they actually trust.

"This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney""Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis."" So yes that is why the electoral college shouldn't be removed.

But the Electoral College also have rules in this article by Richard Posner ""The Electoral College reguires a presidential candidate to have no tran-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect President."" Like think about it if one of the big states for example lets say Texas wants to vote for canidate but two smaller states want to vote for another canidate but they don't have enough votes to compete with that one big state then the bigger states would always wn the elections and that dosnt make the elections fair like thet should be and that just makes it worse that ""it is"" now beacuse with the electoral college it makes the voting fair because they can see the what all the states want and they can choose who is right for the poisition. People might have other opinions and that is completley fine but at the end of the day a disision has to made and it would be best if it was the best desision for the people being made.

Now back to what the downsides are of the electral college ""The single best argument against the electoral college what we might call the dissaster factor."" a part of Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong."" Even just in the name of that article explains everything that event he ""best"" type of system can be a dissaster, and the entire article cannot be quoted but hopefully with that one quote the point will get across to the people. Everyone should read some sourses before making an disision like this. Not just the people voting so that even the people not voting will fully understand why one disision is being made and whyone isnt being made. This one thing can affect the way electing president will be from now on to the future, unless they deside they want to change it again.

All in all one letter will not change everyone's opinion but it seems like the people who want to remove the electoral college are anachronism instead of the electoral college themselfs it seems like they want to remove them so that the winner take all system will be better on there half so that the running canidate can appeal to the bigger states and win most of their votes.""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to expresss a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" There is nother more that can be said but the reason why this letter was written in the first place, to keep the electoral college.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principle,

I really think this unfair to many students who try there best in school.

Students that have a ""C"" or above should be able to participate in sports . I think that having a ""C"" or above is average and that having a ""D"" or lower should not participate in sports because it is not passing the standard's . People who have ""C"" s and higher should be aloud to play sports because they are meeting the standards of the school . This new rule is not very helpful at keeping students fit because they are not aloud to do any sports because they have a ""C"" in there classes . If students with a grade of ""C"" were aloud to participate in sports then they would be more fit and know how to keep them self's healthy. They would also be trained to pay more attention in class because they have to pay a lot of attention when they are playing sports. Students with a grade of ""C"" may also not be very good at something they are learning and that could bring there grade down .If the student with a grade of ""C"" really wanted to play sports then he would have to try to do better but in school although he might be giving his 100%. Students that don't have any extra curricular activities could also became part of a gang give in to drugs and do many unhealthy things for there body and brains . This is why i think they should change the new policy they have made . Please keep in mind this letter because people who have ""C"" s may be trying there best in his/her class.

Ask a friend a family member anyone you trust enough to give you advice. Siblings and parents give some of the best advice. Why,because they know you better than anyone else they can help you in pretty much any situation. Getting advice might be hard but you just need to believe in it and give it a try. Just be brave and ask a close friend parents siblings trust in yourself and trust in advice

I once tried to do something but i didnt know if I could. So I asked a few of my friends one of my friends said no. two more of my friends said no but then one of my friends since I was kid came up and said yes and my brother said yes. That was when I decided that my close friends and family give me better advice than my new friends. I tried what my friends said I couldn't do and I did it only because my family and close friends gave me good advice.

So even if you can get great advice from one person try to get a group of advice to find out the best idea. if you wanted to rob a bank would you get one friend that says yeah sure or would you want fifty of your other friends saying no. That is an example of good advice taking asking many people for advice instead of one or two. you will have a higher chance of coming out better with more advice advice than one or two people. if some random kid said I bet you wont jump into the river and you ask all of your family and they say dont, who's advice would you take?",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Some people may think that the Face was created by aliens, but it was not. The face is just a natural landform that is a huge rock formation. No aliens were involved in the making of it. Although it has starred in books, films, magazines and talk shows that does not mean it was created by aliens.

To start from the beginning, NASA was just circling Mars taking pictures of possible places where one of the other ships could land. Then it spotted the shadowy rock that looked like a face. A few days after NASA snapped the photo of the Face everyone was engaged in it.

Anyways, the photo that NASA snapped of the Face was not created by aliens. If it was NASA would be looking for any form of life on my Mars instead of just calling it a natural landform.

It was just a landform that was created naturally like the ones on Earth.

In conclusion, I would like to say there is no actual evidence that aliens created the landform or that they exist. The Face was not created by aliens and is just made out of rock that happened to form into the shape of a face and as time goes on it looks less like a face.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"It's FACTS That We Don't Need FACS

Being in school brings out a mix of emotions in every student. Wether the student is stressed, happy, or sad depends on many different variables. A student can feel these emotions because of a situation at home, a problem with a friend, and obviously because of the lessons or schoolwork going on in class. Can a machine truly and effectively montior these emotions? Is a machine like this really needed in the current education system? It's not, The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a calssroom is not valuable.

First of all, human emotions are complex. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" gave us several examples of muscles in the human face that were used when expressing emotion. A couple examples of these are the ""frontalis pars lateralis,"" and the ""orbicularis oris."" Although these muscles and the parts of the face they move are an important part of dictating emotion, that's not all there is to understanding emotion. Body language is a massive part of emotion. The FACS may register a happy smile, but it won't see slouching shoulders. The text even states that, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion.)"" This means the FACS reads a blank expression as showing no emotion. What if someone with a person with a blank expression is conveying emotion through body language? Being a student and teenager, body language is a huge part of communication. With the FACS not being able to read body language, that's already a giant hole in its value.

Next, how useful would this technology be outside of an elementary school setting? The answer is absolutely not useful. In elementary school the teacher caters to each students' needs. They're able to do so because you have the same 20 to 30 kids every minute of every day for 180 schools days. But, in middle school and high school students have seven to eight different teachers throughout the day. Middle and high school teachers don't have the one on one time to cater to their students. As cold as it sounds, middle and high school teachers simply might not even care about their students feelings. At least not to the degree an elementary teacher would. Teachers in the upper levels have a strict set of standards that they need to teach. Students must then master those standards to pass the class. There isn't enough time for an upper level teacher to care about their students' emotions.

Finally, students are kids. Kids experience a plethora of emotions throughout the day. Even though, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are unviersal,"" what would one use the information gathered from FACS for? Dr. Huang believes that, ""it [FACS] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The fact that the text states that FACS is just as effective as a human teacher completely renders itself useless. If Dr. Haung, the software engineer of FACS, believes that this machine performs on an equal level to a human, there is absolutely no need for the FACS. As previously mentioned, upper level teachers do not have the time to modify their lesson plans due to their students emotions. That fact alone removes the need for the FACS.

In conclusion, the use of FACS is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The FACS does not have a place in the current education sytem. With evidence from the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is clear that the FACS is only on the same level of reading emotions as, ""an effective teacher."" This renders the FACS not only as useless to students in a classroom, but also as a likely massively more expensive alternative to human teachers.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In today's world, often times students get carried away with social media, what may seem like never-ending homework assignments, keeping their grades up, and simply the stress of being a teenager in general. The countless things that students have to deal with can get quite overwhelming. Having a way to escape from all of that stress can be quite beneficial for students. I agree with my principal's decision to require that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students a chance to build relationships with others, it teaches students new skills, and it gives students a creative and/or stress relieving outlet in their hectic lives.

Extracurricular activities give students a chance to build meaningful relationships with others. Often times, students rely on their phones and/or other forms of technology to find sources of entertainment, and thus, deprive themselves of healthy, face-to-face, social interaction. Extracurricular activities give students great opportunities for social interaction and growth that they may not get otherwise. They give students a safe environment that they can go to to make friends, and learn to be a good friend. Though students can often build relationships with peers, they can build relationships with coaches, teachers, and other potential role-models as well . Not only can they befriend these role models, but they can learn valuable lessons from them as well.

Whilst participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn to develop the skills that they currently have, and learn new skills that could aid them in life. Skills such as the ability to be a leader, hard worker, team-player, good friend, and many others is a common thing that students take away from participating in extracurricular activities. For example, students that decide to serve on the student council can learn to develop valuable leadership skills that could potentially help them to be a good leader in an occupation later in life. Not only that, but students may also learn more about themselves and find out that they have certain skills that they did not know about before. While introducing new skills to students, these activities help students develop their previous talents as well by giving them opportunities to improve. Not only do extracurricular activities help improve students' skills, they also improve their mental state.

As previously stated, the lives of students can be quite hectic. When students participate in an extracurricular activity, it provides them with a creative and/or stress-relieving outlet to deal with stress and it gives them valuable life experience. Unfortunately, many teens that get overwhelmed with stress get mental illnesses that can lead them to do unhealthy things. Examples of unhealthy things that teens do when overwhelmed are they could partake of drugs and/or alcohol, harm themselves, or possibly even commit suicide. Extracurricular activities provide students with a safe environment to be themselves and worry less about the stress of daily life. It gives them a break from homework, social media, grades, and other things that could increase the levels of stress in their lives. It also gives students valuable life experience and opportunities to draw upon previous experience. For example; a student could use their knowledge and experience with being captain of their volleyball team to learn to be a good boss.

I agree with my principal's decision to have each student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because extracurricular activities can help students by giving students the chance to build relationships with others and use their social skills, and they can teach students new skills and help them develop their current talents. They also give students valuable life experience as well as an outlet to relieve stress and freely exhibit their creativity. Through the stressful and hectic life of a student, extracurricular activities provide a safe place, valuable skills, friends, life experience, and so much more. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"A Cowboy Who Rode he Waves Essay

Intoduction

Luke had turned 18 before he arrived in Greece, he said"" I could be drafted for military services"" ( paragraph 4). It took Luke to get across the Atlantic Ocean eastern coast of the United States 2 weeks, and 1 month to get to China. Luke had made a least 9 trips, more than any Seagoing cowboy. By the time it was 1947 Luke had helped people he said "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China"" ( paragraph 5). Luke had visited Venice,Italy he rode a gondola because the streets were water. He also "" took a tour in a excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canalon his way to China"" (paragraph 5).

Reasons A few reasons why you should to join the program that Luke is in because 1: he is a night watchman. That seems exicting because he gets to watch over the animal.2: he got to to visit a whole lot of places like Venice, Europe, China, and the Panama Canal. 3: he was on a boat so he got to visit the places like Europe and China. The last reason is to keep himself busy is caring for the animals during th crossing.

Body What Luke likes about being Seagoing Cowboys is he metioned that this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. When he first got on the boat he was exicted to visit the coolest places. The First one he visited was Greece that was the place they headed first. Then it was Europe that was where the boat was headed toward. Venice it is last he said "" So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water.

Conclusion They are so manythings that Luke learned that ws really acurate of being a night watchman. Like helping people benefit of seeing Europe and China. Going through new expirence places like Europe, China, Veince,Italy. I am sure he probably visited more but, who knows. Luke learned that they'res a lot to handle of being a military watchman. The opportunity of a lifetime if he didn't take who knows of what could've happened to his life after he took the opportunity I am also sure he said hello to my New Life.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I think Venus not is a worthy pursuit because of the dangers. Venus is too hot for human to live on it's too close to the sun. The atmosphere of Venus it too thin it lets too much heat into the planet. We wont be able to survive. How do you now we will have enogh oxygen on venus to live.

First, the planet Venus it toohot for human life to survive. Venus is the second plantes from the sun it's too close to the sun for us to even try to make it there. Also no one knows how long it will take us to get to Venus wonder if the spacecraft run's out of oxygen. If it run's out of oxygen everyone will die before theyy make it to Venus, but wonder if they do make it to Venus it might not be a lot of oxygen to breathe in because the planet is so hot. Then wonder if there no water you need water to survive ecause Earth is a liquid based planet,but Venus is not.

Secondly, how do we no if the spacecraft will be able to take that type of heat. The palnet surface temperatures on Venus average over 800 degrees fahrenheit I know that's way too hot. That type of temperature is beyond of what I can imagine I know Earth's surface is hot, but not that hot. Venus atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide I think it's like that, because it's so close the sun. The closer you get to the sun the more radiant energy it gives off and too much radiant energy can be bad. Like how do we know that the spacecraft will still be getting singnal from Earth, because wonder if the eletronic gadgets over heat and just give out because the planet is so hot.

Lastly, they say that venus is our twin planet. I don't see how it can be our twin planet because it so hot and it's very radiant. The planet Venus has a rocky sediment and icludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Earth and Venus can be twins because Earth is not rocky it's a liquid based planet. Venus has a thin atmosphere because the heat keeps it's so hot and thin it can't get a break to even expand. But Earthis not as close, so Earth's atmosphere is a little bit thicker the Venus's atmosphere. Venus might also have some harmful chemicals. I say this because how do we know what's on the planet its could be all types of harmful gases from the sun. We never know what's there on Venus or what could happen if we go.

In conclusion,

I think Venus not is a worthy pursuit because of the dangers. Venus is too hot for human to live on it's too close to the sun. The atmosphere of Venus it too thin it lets too much heat into the planet. We wont be able to survive. How do you now we will have enogh oxygen on venus to live. We don't know how long it will take to get there and how much supplies we will need to take and what supplies to even take. It's al ot to think about before we could eventhink about living on Venus. We would need to figure a lot of things off first before we go. ",0,persuade_corpus,1

Although, in ""The challenge of exploring venus"" the author gives a bunch of reasons as to why no one travels to venus. Such as , the 800 degree farenheit weather, the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere, and the thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets.

"Somtimes i wish i could vote, then i could argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. I will pick change to election by popular vote for the president of the US. I would pick that because the Electoral votes are anachronism,  it might choose the wrong person to run in office, and the Electoral votes are not fair.

The first reason why i would pick popular votes over the Electoral vote is because electoral votes are anachronism. anachronism means a person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. Source3 of the article 'In defense of the Electoral college"" states that ""The Electoral college is wildely regarded as an ""anachronism"",a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

The soncond reason is that electoral votes might chose the wrong person to run in office. source3 part five of the article ""Indefense of the electoral college"" states that,""it can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the presidedent may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""

The last reason why is because theElectoral votes are not fair. Source3 part 2 states that ""no region...has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" also source3 states that ""Electoral college method is not demovratic in a modern sense ...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. And source 2 states that ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

In conclusion the electoral vote is un fair in many many ways. not only it chaets for others it does not let the people chose who to be president. POPULARITY votes are better than Electoral in many ways. and its modern.                                                                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The Facial Action Coding System technology is a new thing to detect how people are feeling using the computer.

This technology can also be good for detecting if someone is feeling bad or is depressed. They can use this as a form of helping people out if no one can tell they are sad. For instence in paragraph three ""Eckman had classified six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."". If they can use this to treat people who are not happy it can solve a bunch of problems in the future.

"Have you ever seen a movie about aliens? Those green, bug looking creatures with big eyes and laser guns. Now, have you ever heard of the ""Face on Mars?"" If you have, then this is going to explain to you why the Face is a natural landform and not some monument created by aliens.

When NASA first saw the ""Face on Mars"" they claimed they spotted what the text states, ""the shadowy likeness of a human face."" The image was found when they were snapping photos of possible landing sights for Viking 2, one of NASA's spacecrafts circling the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The passage later states, ""But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" The scientits even said it was just a landform. They stated that it has,""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The scientists are not saying it's a alien monument either. They are just saying people could petray it that way.

A few days after this discoery NASA unveiled the image. When they unveiled it there was a capiton under it reading, ""huge rock formation."" NASA said the formation resembles a head and was formed by shadows giving the illusion of the facial features. This just made the Face a publicity stunt for most people. This might be when most would believe that it is some sort of a alien monument. But then NASA passed over the Face again and this time took a phots much greater then the last.

On April 5, 1988, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the ""Face on Mars."" They snapped picutres ten times sharper then before. The text states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site."" Thouands waited for the photo and what the photos unveiled were the truth. The photos revelead a natural landform, not any alien monument. Some people still believed that the structure was still an alien monument. But NASA learned that not all will believe.

All this evidence is just showing you that it is a natural landform. They have coordinates of this landform. They have amazing pictures just showing you that this is real. Even scientists examining the photos and showing exactly how what it is. What is it you must ask? It's a landform. NASA knew not all would believe but it made no sense to them. They supply so much evidence but still some just don't believe. The ""Face on Mars"" resembles a human head but shadows give it the illusion of a face.

In conclusion, the 'Face on Mars' is nothing more then a natural landform. We have photo proof of the Face along with scientists examining it and telling all who do not believe what it is. The Face is a natural landform. I have given you all the evidence. I have showed you that it's a natural landform. The only question is, do you believe it is?",0,persuade_corpus,2

Many people feel that this has taken  a weight off their shoulders. othr places are adopting the idea of living car free. If this continues it could drastically lower the amount of air polution.

Gremany is not the only place making efforts to reduce pollution and cut back on auto-useage. In Paris after near record pollution a partial driving ban was inforce to help clear the air pollution. For a day all the drivers with even numbered license plates were ordered not to drive their cars or be charged with a $31 dollar fine and the next day drivers with odd numbered drivers license were ordered to do the same. After five long dats of smog congestion went down sixty percent. Although delivery companies lost revenue, the temparary ban lowered pollution in paris.

In Bogota, Colombia car-free day is a huge hit. this would make it the tird year in a row that cars were banned with only busses and taxis permitted to roam the streets. thye goal of this day s to reduce pollution and premote alternative forms of taransportation.

"Venus today is bizarre to many scientist. It's green appearence and similarity to Earth is why Venus is a must-visit planet to scientist today. Scientist claim it used to have life, habitable for humans and animals, Which it is said to have had water long ago. Proof of it being is because of it having formed structures that we know water would. It has very familiar features with Earth, those being; valleys, mountains, and craters.

"How many people do you ask for opinions when you need help? Many people seek multiple opinions when needing help. There are many reasons why you would want to seek different opinions. These reasons include, getting more than one perspective, someone may have gone through something similar, someone may have more knowledge in that area.

Have you ever asked a negative friend their opinion on something? Relating to that, have you ever asked a positive friend their outlook on something? The opinions probably varied drastically. Many people have different perspectives than others. For example, yesterday I asked my positive friend if I should curl or straighten my hair, she said,""It doesn't matter, you'll look great either way!"" Then I asked my negative friend what they think I should do and he said, ""It doesn't matter, I don't see why you do your hair for school anyway."" As you can see the opinions varied drastically according to each outlook.

Another notable reason why you should get more than one opinion is because someone may have gone through something similar. Someone may have been in the same situation as you. For instance, if you are having a baby and you need to decide whether to have it at the hospital or a natural birth. You probably want to ask someone that has been through natural child birth and someone that has been through hospital child labor. You wouldn't want to ask someone that has never had a child what to do.

When you ask someone for their opinion you want them to have knowledge in that area. For example, if you ask someone about the cough and runny nose you have their mind might jump to a cold. Meanwhile if you ask a doctor, they might test you for the flu. In this case, the doctor has more experience, therefore it's good that you got their opinion also.

As you can see, there are many reasons why getting a second or third opinion wouldn't hurt. Many people everywhere in the world reach to others for their opinions on situations, whether their opinion is professional or not. Next time you need an opinion on something, try going to some one else about it and see if the problem was solved easier or harder. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Assume you have to decide something, wither its to buy something you like or its which sports team you should play for. Don't you usually ask more than one person? Even if you don't, have you ever thought of why you or someone else would do that? Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can get more background information than just one person can usually provide and the more people you ask the more prepared you will be for any issues that could occur.

Asking more than one person can help you get more background information than just one person will be able to provide. If you ask just one person than their information may be biased and have not as many facts as opinions, but if you ask more than one person than you will have a better chance of getting more facts than opinions. If its about something on the news, social media, and/or its a rumor being spread you can get both/all sides of the story before you form your opinion on that certain topic. Plus if you ask people who have done it before your information will be more accurate than someone will equal experience or less experience than you.

A lot like if you ask more than one person you get more background information, if you do that you also will be more prepared for any issues that may happen. You will be less likely to assume that something will happen if you have heard about it from someone that has had it happened to them. You won't be as surprised if something happens that you didn't expect to happen because like how you won't make assumptions, you will have asked people who have had that happen to them. This doesn't always work because you can spend you whole life building up background information to do something you'll never do it because you are to busy asking people. There is always a happy medium. If you only ask one person then you wont be prepared enough and if you ask to many people then you might never be able to do what you set out to do.

Most people never wonder why they ask more than one person; you probably never did either but the more people you ask the better off you will be. you will be more prepared for any issues than may pop up and you will have more background information that could be necessary to make the decision you wish to make.

Summer projects should be student designed because of the time, skill, and effort that will be displayed differently by every student.

In order to get the brain back into the school mode for students, it takes time. Time vary between everybody because no one is on the same schedule. One person that has done nothing all summer will have a lot more time to complete a good, well thought project, versus someone that's been away at sleep away camp all summer. Why should it be the teachers right to decide how much time you should be able to get on a project they assigned having no idea about your plan for the summer? If a student was allowed to make their own project based on what they have time for, the project will be a lot better than if they crammed a ton of information they are not prepared for with that small amount of time. Projects would not only be neater, but more sophisticated because they did what they could do with the time they set aside. No one teacher could possibly know how much time you have, but also the true amount of skill that you also possess.

Going into the year the teacher does not really know what you can do from an academic standpoint yet so why should they assume your skill with a before school, summer project? In order for a teacher to get a feel to where your ability level lies, they must first get to know you and see your potential. A project that is assigned to one student could be in someone's wheel house, while another kid could really struggle on the subject that the project is on. There is no way of knowing unless the project is driven by what the student wants and what the student is able to achieve. Students should be able to harness their abilities for their summer project that will also display their effort.

Effort for school in the summer is not something that any student would want to do. Being cooped up inside doing a project for school instead of going to the pool with your friends is something that I'm willing to bet, no kid would choose to do. If students were allowed to choose their summer project they might be more willing to put in effort versus some boring, strict guidelines thing that a teacher would assign. Effort is hard to get out of a kid during the long, dog days of summer, so how can you expect them to put in their effort on something they know is painful and creativity destroying? The effort shown from students still might not be sufficient, but it will be better if it's something the kid wants to do, and not just assigned from a teacher. Kids want freedom, and with freedom to decide your project thats due at the end of summer vacation only seems right. If you're going to make students work on their vacation at least let them do it by their standards, and don't just tell them blatantly what to do.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that students of SCHOOL_NAME should be aloud to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, just as long as the phones are turned off during class.

I strongly agree with this subject. Teens in our school are getting in trouble almost everyday because they are getting their phones taken away from them in lunch and breaks in between classes. Then there are some students who don't really get what ""No phones in class"" means.

I think that you should make it so we can have our phones out during lunch and between classes, because sometimes it maybe an emergency and we need to call our parents about something that we don't want to talk about in the office phone were everyone can hear what your saying around you. Therefore if you have a cell phone you can go call your parents some were quite, were know one can hear what your saying.

This just might help you to. I am almost sure that schools have to pay a phone bill, am i right? well by letting teens use their phones you can decrease the bill, or even better get rid of all the extra phones. Then if you need to get a hold of someone in another room you have the PA speakers.

I hope you take this even more serious than i do, i feel that it is a privacy purpose to students at SCHOOL_NAME.

My personal experience with office ladies listening to my conversation is very bad, i can hear them talking about what i was talking about to my sister in the office. Well some of the things that i said where personal, not only to me but to my sister.

I hope you at least think about this subject and consider letting students use their phones at lunch and in between breaks we have after classes.

Thank You

"Dear Principal,

I think that it is unfair that kids cant have sports or activities the one reason i say this is because sports and activities is not stopping kids to learn. I think if you take away sports it will hurt children because if the kid would like to be a football, basketball, soccer player he/she couldn't achieve that goal because the school is taking away sports and activities. I think that you should have these sports but kids with a d-f should not be able to participate in the sport or activity, so if a child is really interested he/she will step up and do what he/she can do to improve his/her grade. When your a student you just want to express yourself and have time off to join sports and games. Kids enjoy this and if you take this opportunity away from them they will be very upset. Sports and activities can also help you get into the college you would like to go to because when a child is joining a sport lots of college professors want to see that. Another thing i would like to point out is that lots of kids would like to have a prep rally and see there friends and family play that sport. Sense i am a student here i would dislike not having to play sports or do activities. When kids play a sport it takes there stress away and hypes them up so taking a sport opens there minds. Children this age just want fun and games so i do think this might be to much credit for them but it still wont be fair for the students not being able to become what they want to be when there older, Also being a student your in school for about eight hours and after school people would enjoy doing what they love and go to there sports and or activities. I would like to say thank you for your time and effort i hope you understand.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades! Have you ever wonder why we know so little about Venus and more about Mars? Well one of the reasons why not a single spacecraft has landed on Venus is becaiuse it has a thick tmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Whicn resulted on the spacecraft survinving the landing for more than a few hours.

There's a few scientists and people who believe that the studing of Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the kind of dangers it might cause. the athour sopports his idea that studing Venus is worthy when he said that striving to meet the chanllenge that is prensented by Venus it has value, not just because of the insight to be gained. But also because human's curiosity will likely lead us into many equally as statend in (pragraph 7)

In conlusion, we should study Venus more because it will help us learn new information. Also because it's a like earth a lot they both have same density and size. And it's also the closest distance to Earth, but most importantly we should study it because it might make us discover something new like a creature pobrably and might be able to discover new rocks. If scientist do decide to send a spacecraft to Venus it might take decades to do that find out about Venus or find a way to make the landing last longer. All in all the Author has good suporting details about his idea that im sure will happen because as human beings we are alwasy cuorius about new things. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Transportation takes up most of our time. Many of us sit in the cars waiting to get to a place without realizing that we actually spend more time in our car. Transportation is the second leading cause for the emissions in the United States. Car-Free cities are starting to trend in Europe. In the car-free cities you no longer have to worry about where to park. We need to lower the amount of emissions we produce on a daily bases, for America most of our emissions are from gas while in Paris the emissions come from diesel.

Paris has been really polluted, there is much smog that they had decided to ban driving, whoever drove recieved a fine on that day. Paris would take turns on the license plate number to determine if you could drive that day or not. A car-free day in Bogota, Colombia had many people walking, hiking and taking the bus. The streets were free or almost free from traffic jam,violaters who did not participate were fined.

Obama has recently announced that he would like for America to lower the emissions we produce. Statistics show that less people are purchasing cars also there are less people getting their drivers license. In Vauban, Germany they do not just go a day without cars, it is a suburb where street parking are forbidden, it is an expermental site where people are to be without cars. People from there are much happier they no longer have to worry about traffic or congestion they just walk, ride a bike or bus. 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. Cars can cause us to be stressed and it even harms the enviroment.

The advantages would be we'd be more calm and relaxed people rather then trying to hurry and speed in a car. We would also have much clean air. The money that the city gets from the violators would be used to make the community a much better and clean place. Although it is limited it does not mean you cannot use your car, but you may want to live in another area if you keep getting fined. Many people if they choose to walk or ride a bike will become more fit and healthy. Maybe we should consider it even if its just for a day it makes all the difference.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Rick Scott,

Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state (Florida, Texas, etc.) to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College canidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are apposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen's votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican canidate. Many people say that the electoral college ""takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn't matter"" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the memebers of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?

Not only do the Citizen's votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state's vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids run-off elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state's vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a run-off election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats; that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reudces, ultimatley showing a clear winner.

And finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State's Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It's also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimatley the most dangerous voter there is; an uner educated one.

So Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen's vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state's smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.             ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"With the advancement of technology, cars are now being altered to fit human wants.

Driverless cars are advancing in recent years.

According to the text, car companies and manufacturers such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are all in plan of the development of these cars to be sold by the year 2020.

These cars may appear as eye-candy at first glance, however they can cause danger to the people in certain conditions in many ways.

Driverless cars seem spectacular, however people are unaware that it is not ""driveless"" as the manufacturers say.

These cars have the ability to complete the basic necessities of driving, such as steering, accelerating, and braking, but there is a problem with this.

The text explains how the new cars are not able to be driven in certain conditions such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

Because of this, the human driver must stay alert throughout the entire drive when the car is in need of an extra hand.

This is a problem beacuse humans could get bored of waiting or get distracted which is problematic if the car is not fast enough to warn the human.

In short, actually having humans agree to the comitment of being ready to take over the task of driving in a driverless car seems to be unrealistic.

With all this being said, someone might ponder on how the car could be slow to warn the human.

Creating a driverless car means a person has to put all their trust into a large piece of technology.

This could cause many problems, for example, the text explains how the cars are equipt with many cameras and sensors.

This is problematic because if the car's technology has a defect in it in some way, the human in the car will most likely get in an accident without doing anything.

According to the text, many places such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have made it illegal to test computer-driven cars there. Finally, in the case of an accident actually occuring, the problem people would face is if the car manufacturer or the human would be the one to blame.

In the end, driverless cars are not safe and could lead to many problems.

Driverless cars are approaching into the world fast.

This new technology should not be trusted due to the speed of its development.

Humans could face many problems with these cars now entering today's society.

To conclude, driverless cars appear to be an extravegant idea however, when acutually thought out, many issues could occur leaving problems in the end.              ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear

Principal,

I think that the second policy is better because students shouldn't have phones during class or on free time. Cell phones are going to take learning away from students if they have there phones with them all the time. If we come to school to learn then why should we have our cell phones with us?! I think cell phones during school is going to be bad because it will take away a lot of learning that we need in our life.

School is very important because school will help you get a great job we you get older. If all the kids have a cell phone with them at school then there's going to be less education in there life because they are not dong what they are suppose to be doing, they are texting or calling when they are suppose to be doing there work and learning about history or math. To keep kids focus they shouldn't bring there phones to school or if they do bring there phones to school then give it to the office or your teacher to hold on to it until school its over.

I feel that if you let the students bring there cell phones to school it could start something or bring trouble. Students will be very off task when they should be focus on getting their work done and not bringing it all home and not doing there work. Cell phones should be used outside of school and not during school. If you let the students bring cell phones to school then your taking there education away from them. If students start to fail because they are not doing what they are suppose to be doing then you are going to look bad because your students are failing from being unfocused.

Yes kids bring phones to school when they are not suppose to but not all of them use it during class. They only bring there phones for when school is over and if they need to call there mom or dad. I only bring my phone so that if something bad were to happening after school when i am walking home or if i need to call for a question i have my cell phone. I have never used my phone during school because it is going to get me off task. I want to have an education and have a great job when i get older and so do other students but if you let them bring there phones then its going to get them very unfocused and off task.

I hope that you will keep cell phones from use in school. I know that students will be mad at first but they will see when you let them bring there phones how unfocused it is during school. Kids have a lot of things going on in there life and when they have a cell phone i bet they talk about how they feel to there friends. Also it is a off task thing because of un answer questions they might have from a friend or some one. So please hear me out and do not let students use cell phones at all in school.

"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars. I think that the information that i have presented you with would go to show and prove my theory right. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Summer break is a time of joy for adults and students alike. However, for students their brains still need to be stimulated so that when they go back to their everyday school-lives they do not forget what they have learned. The means of producing that knowledge for students however, can either be from teachers or from their student peers. Although students should be assigned teacher-designed projects because their assignments are guaranteed to be curriculum based, summer projects should be student-designed because students are able to enjoy themselves over break, they are given the chance to be creative in their learning, and will not be stressed over the summer.

To begin with, students are able to design projects that will bring enjoyment to their fellow classmates. Pupils have common interest to one another, so they would be able to create a project that would be equally enjoyable to their classmates. As a result, this enjoyment will make students more willing to participate in their summer assignment because when someone enjoys doing something they are more apt to do it no matter the amount of time or work that goes into it. Furthermore, if an assignment were to be given over the break, that assignment should be something students enjoy doing. The reason being because summer is the season of enjoyable recreation and by allowing students, who are equally eager to have fun over the break, design said project they are able to stay true to point of summer.

In continuation, student-designed projects give students the ability to add creativity to their learning. On a regular school day teachers are the ones who decide how students will lean. Sometimes what the teacher chooses is only beneficial to a handful of students, and the others have to make due with what they have. By giving the students a chance to make a summer project, they can come up with a learning process that is geared towards their peers. Students feel more comfortable expressing the way they feel they learn best with their classmates, so by giving the creative liberty to students the product created will be something that benefits everyone.

Furthermore, with students designing their own summer projects they will not be stressed over the break. Students are aware of each others needs and their own personal needs, so as a result, they will create an assignment that will not overwork their classmates or themselves. The reason being whatever project is created by the students will most likely have to be completed by the creators too, so if they assign something that will take the majority of the summer to complete or cause a decrease in their mental health, they will have to participate in this assignment as well. However, if a teacher made the summer project they would not have to pay the same price. Which is why a project made by teachers will not be as mindful to the students need to de-stress and prepare for the upcoming school year as a student-designed project would.

Finally, students should design their summer project because they are able to create something everyone will love, they get the chance to think creatively, and they reduce the stress that comes with a summer assignment. If students are given the chance design the summer project the students will come back to school having better learned the material they were given. In conclusion, allow students to design their summer projects because the results would ultimately be very beneficial to all students. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Proving The Face is Just a Natural Landform.

Although this face was unexpected,that doesn't nessasarily define that the face has anything to do with aliens. There are majority of theories we can assume from this topic. Few scientist condoned that this mysterious face had something to do with a very unordinary prediction .Some scientist seemed surprised when they saw the photograph of the face on mars.

As a scientist, many mistakes are made during observations, but that's apart of human life. Mistakes are casual in everyday life and, all of us make them. In my opinion, I don't think this entertaining outbreak had anything to do with aliens. In fact, they're wasn't a specific sign, or clue that an alien was actually was involved. NASA got a great shot at the face, and the picture closely showed that their was nothing do be deeply concerned about.

The face was defineitly rare, but over the years the face continues to fade so it shouldn't be harmful. If it happened to really be an alien, we would know from the recordings, and pictures that were captured. This is a huge topic to discuss, and space can likely be considered as a horrifying setting due to rumors, and scientific observations. Astrounaunts never discovered any issues, or new assumptions by traveling to space.

The main point is aliens aren't realistic, you may see them in movies, books, or perhaps may hear about them. An alien was never discovered by NASA, and the face just appeared to be a natural cause. The face could of been anything, but we know it wasn't an alien because there is no proof that the face was an alien, and still isn't as we speak.

In conclusion, think about other things that are possible.                                                                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear State Senator,

Everyone has their very own opinions on whether or not the Electoral College should be abolished. Well, with evidence from past elections, it is pretty clear that the Electoral College rule should be abandoned. Let alone is the Electoral College unfair in many ways, but also, it is unneeded.

First and foremost, the Electoral College should left in the wind because it is unfair. Our society and todays people have different opinions and different standards in life, then the people in 1776. For example, in those times, the states we have now were not all how they were then: 1. there was a much smaller population, 2. not all the states we have now were America's states then, and 3. peoples beliefs were different. In ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" states ""under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Pgph. 10) This is saying that the citizens votes are not being counted for, voting directly to the presidential election, but to the states Electoral College. Obviously, the people want their votes to mean something, and not to just let the others vote for them. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt even see the candidates at all,"" This clearly shows that getting rid of the Electoral College would be best.

Secondly, the Electoral College is unneeded for voting. The citizens cast a vote in the poll, so that the president they want will when. So, how does having an Electoral College make the peoples votes needed. Let alone, the citizens make their own decisions. If this country is a democracy, it means the people are apart of the choices of the government to, but with the Electoral College, the state casts in only a small vote from each state. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" (Pgph. 12) The Electoral College is simply unneed.

Lastly, everyone has their own opinions on whether or not we should get rid of the electoral college. It is very simple, the Electoral College should be demolished, due to being unfair, and unneeded.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"State Senator,

If the slogan of our nation is ""We the people,"" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? How can a president win the popular vote but lose the presidency? None of that makes any sense. Our nation needs to abolish the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The system of the Electoral College is irrational, unfair, and not for the citizens.

To begin, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" (Plumer, paragraph 13). ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (Plumer, paragraph 11). If the United States is really all about the citizens, then they do not have a good way at showing it. We as citizens live here, and call this nation our home, but yet we can not even elect our own president. The Electoral College is unfair to us as voters.

In addition, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a state of electors."" (Posner, paragraph 15). That textual evidence came from a passage in defense of the Electoral College! We the people should have a say! This system is not for us as citizens of the United States, and it is wrong! This is our home so let US pick our president.

Furthermore, ""... and the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" (Posner, paragraph 20). This statement is very true because voters should be thorough when voting, but why should we be? It is not like we need to take our time and compare and contrast the presidential candidates. We are not voting for the president of our choice, so what is the point of being thorough? It is wrong to have this system, and it needs to be changed.

To conclude, as I have said above, If the slogan of our nation is ""We the people,"" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? The system of the Electoral College needs to be abolished. It is not letting us as citizens elect our choice of the president that we want. It is unfair and irrational. I am in favor of changing the system to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2

"Students have the option to attend classes from home that some schools offer them. It's important for students to get a good education whether they get it from attending to school or online. Schools must focus on some ways students can be benefited from learning. Schools should not offer students options to attend classes from home because students will not take their education seriously, they will be distracted from many things, and they will not learn efficiently.

Many students don't take their lives seriously, especially their education. This school option will make students not to complete their tasks on time. Because they will not have an adult telling them that they need to complete, they will take their education less serious. They will not see education as an important thing. It's likely that they would be slacking around at home, because teachers will not be there to tell them what to do.

There are many things students can be distracted from. Any device, for example, can be a distraction for students. A phone can be a problem for them. It's a distraction that can stop them from learning. There are high chances students would be texting with someone and using social media when taking classes online. They would also be going out too much, leading them to forget that they have classes to take online. At home, they would feel tired and bored because they won't even have any social interaction. They would go out more often and would it would lead them to be distracted every time they go out.

Education is important, but taking classes online will not make students to learn efficiently. They need teachers to guide and tell them what to do. If they don't have a teacher to tell them what to do or how to do it, they will end up confused, not knowing what to do next. They will not be learning anything because they will not understand what they're doing. Their knowledge will decrease due to the lack of learning.

Although some people may say that attending classes at home is good, they are not correct. Taking classes online does not benefit students from learning. In fact, it makes them less productive. They will not have idea of what is going on. Attending classes online is not the best way for students to learn.     ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Principal,

I have just heard that you wanted to change the policy where now you have to have a B to play sports. I think that this is very wrong to do. I believe in the ""No pass, no play"", which means that you should be able to make a C and still play sports. In fact, by making this change you could very well sideline some of your best players because they make a C. I understand that your grades mean everything, but it is not right to make players sit the bench because they don't make A' s or B' s. I believe that some people, even though they don't make good grades, are meant to earn a college scholarship to play football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, or even run track. I believe you should consider letting C' s slide.

I don't think this is totally right. If you do this, you might not could even field a team, which is very bad. We have a pretty good athletic program, which could drastically change very quickly if you change the policy. Thank you for your time.

With utmost respect,

I think that only children with an b average shouldn't be the only ones to participate in school activities. Because more students have a c average than a b average. Also if you only choose the ones with a b average most of them, aren't athletic so you want have any sport teams. Also we will have to forfit all the game we have and, we will all be sad. You should actually have either a vote or try outs for the sport.

If you do this then you will have a actual team for the year. You would probably have more people on the basketball team than , any other sport, because its the most liked than any other sport. I also think that everybody except people with an f average should be able to participate. Because the ones with an f average must play in class, or need extra help. This is why I don't think that only b averages get to participate in school activities.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The face on mars was first found by the spacecraft called Viking one and was cirling mars when it found the face. alot of people belive it is a real artifact. NASA has took more pictures to prove that it is infact not an artifact. People belive there just covering it up so pople wont know about it. But that is not true it would benifit NASA if it were an true artifact.

The face on mars is just a lndform because of the pictures we took we could not see and form of building structure. one thing that brings me to this conclusion is the rocks and shadows made it look and seem very real. The text states ""...formed by shadows..."". Tv and other things are what is drawing the attention to the matter andthey are whats broadcasting to the world that it is real. The text states "" It starred in a hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines, radio talk shows...""

"How could we get the reduction of Greenhouse Gas? We can simply do this by reducing the number of cars on the road. In the city of Vauban, Germany, they gave up cars completely. If you still own a car in this city you have to buy a large garage that runs to  about $40,000. This expense doesn't include your house. Up to 70% of the cities population of 5,500 have given up their motor vehicle. The passenger cars in the city are responsible for 12% of the Greenhouse gas. I believe that if we, in the state of Florida, give up our cars that we can literally save the world.

First, Today in the sunshine state, we love to sit in our air conditioned motor vehicles. We love to take a joy ride by the beach, but do you know the real damage you're doing to our world? In the United States alone we produce about 50% of the Greemhouse gas. With how many citizens we have, what would that number be if we cut out all motor vehicles? We would be saving the Earth. How does that make you feel? Like a hero? That's what you would be.

Secondly, We all own houses that cost so much! To be able to park your car you could have to buy a large enough garage, that would be at the end of your comuntiy that could cost up to $40,000. Why pay this outrageous amount to be the only one driving around your car-free city? If we do take this comitment on reducing our driving, how would you get to work? This is a common question asked. We would be forced to put work establishments within walking distances.

Lastly, we as americans are one of the most obiese countries. We sit in cars and drive around daily. Our government has actually made it even more easy to acess fast food, they put in drive threws. Some thought that this awesome, new, cool invention could help us save time, but in reality it just make it more simple to get these bad habits. If we really want to eat these bad foods, we would have to walk there. Thus we would be getting more exercise. Getting rid of cars would be the best thing that has happened to us in a long time.

In conclusion, We need to take a stand and stop all motor vehicles. With these powered automobiles we are damaging the earth with Greenhouse gas, Saving money, and giving us what we need. I believe that this change needs to be made soon, or who knows where we could end up. Lets get all states to get rid of all motor vehicles. This stand could change everything as we know it!

"Cars can be very dangerous to this day. So many people are get hurt driving in cars or driving the cars. There are so many things cars can do that can hurt you or before you know it you're dead. Would you want to be that person that gets hurts because the car can drive by itself? I don't think anyone would want to be that person hurt because of a car messing up and it wouldn't be your fault one bit. I would rather take responibility on getting hurt or dead then knowing I can't do anything about it because my car is driving itself.

My position on driverless cars are that you should drive the car yourself. In paragraph 7 it says, ""This means the human driver must remain alert to be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Most humans aren't alert driving by themselves let alone being alert when something goes wrong and not knowing when it will be. Technology is really good today, but it is also can go bad whenever it wants to. You don't want to be put in a sitituation where you don't know when something bad is going to happen and you aren't paying attention so you can't do anything about it, next thing you know you're in the hospital or even worse in a coma. I just think having a fancy car that can drive itself is not worth getting hurt over. It's really not. In paragraph 8 it considers, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" It's not about having fun driving. It's about getting to one destination to another. You can put your family in danger.

Having a car to drive itself it's not worth getting hurt over. Technology is really good in all, but it could always go wrong not knowing when. Cars are already dangerous today. I think it would produce more reckless drivers and more accidents around the world. Most people are never focused on the road all the time, and when you have a car that can drive by itself you have to be focused on the road at all times. There are still a lot of postive things to this. It's not all negative. I just think there are more negative than postive. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard everyone talking about you were going to have all kids doing community service. Well I think that it is a complete wonderful idea. I think adding community service to our school would mature our kids, and help our community be cleaner and better. our school has many immature kids here. All they do is disobey teachers, aids ETC.

But adding community service bet would change the way our students act around here. And if we could prove our student here at SCHOOL_NAME k-8 School mature and listen we would be a higher school. We would get plenty more students. The disaplen would defiantly help our school be a better place.

So my opinion on adding community service is defiantly yes. I think that our school would become a better environment. And mature All of the kids. So please recommend adding community service. But I think you should add it during school, because people got thing to do, people to see, and places to go. So I'm against it if its going to be after school. you should add another hour to school and have that be community service or something.

"I think that they should develop these driverless cars. If they did, first of all, it would be cool to have cars that drive themsleves and second because if you needed to get somewhere and couldn't drive then you could. There are a few reasons why I think that they should be developed.

The first reason is because it would cost people a lot less to fill up their cars. They are also not fully driverless. They will alert you when you are pulling in or out of somewhere, or dealing with traffic issues such as construction or accidents. It feel that it could benefit a lot of people and would also make people more interested in driving.

They have been wanting to invent something like this one day. I knew that when they had the opportunity to create a vehicle or anything can can go on its own they would. This driverless car can apply brakes on individual wheels when needed too. It can also reduce power from the engine to help in the need of an emergency. This can help make driving safer because if someone isn't paying attention and a car or something is coming at you, your car can sense that and apply the brakes for you. It is nice that they are also considering using cameras in the cars to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. The car watches the driver and the driver watches the road.

Because of all the reasons I mentioned above, I think that they should develop the driverless car. It will be weird at first having these cars around because you wouldn't expect to see something like that but after a while it can benefit people in the long run that either can't drive like they used too and need to get somewhere, and also most will buy it just because it sounds super cool and to see what it can do.

"Dear State Senator,

As A citizen in the United States i say that keeping the electoral college is a good idea!

Taking away the electoral college would make alot of people angry. Having an electoral college makes it ten times easier for the government. Having an electoral college makes it more fair for citizens and having the majority people agree, alot its alot easier for the governement to see who the people want to lead us and lastly there will be alot less arguments from citizens because if they dont agree they cant do anything about it because majority rules.

Having an electoral college makes it alot more fair for citizens to vote. The electoral college is a process that consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president. Choosing a president and voting for him/her make sthe citizens agree. When it comes down to voting day the citizens have to come to a majority to rule. Having the votes sent to congress and them deciding is very fair because they can decide the final dicison for the citizena dn who tehy think the citizens want more.

The electoral college has 538 electors, so its not like 2 people can decide the president. Having an elecotral college makes it alot easier to decide for the government. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. One for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for you senators. The presidential election is held every 4 years so people have time to decide if they want to re elect or to keep the current president.

Electoral elections have less argument between the citizens. If you took electoral college away people would be starting riots about who to choose. Having this system is very organized and prepared, if you just take away and start something new its going to be a mess. Electoral college is a very mature way in electing president. Citizens dont have to argue because the majority rules all so they cant fight someone because they didnt pick who they wanted

THose are the reasons on why they should not take away electoral college!!It makes it more fair! its makes it easier to decide! Lastely its less arguments with citizens about who won! So as a citizen in the U.S. i say do not take electoral college away!    ",0,persuade_corpus,0

Although this computer could be valuable in some ways like helping your friend feel happy.

"Dear Principal

I feel that everyone should not be required to do community service. I feel this way because community service should be a volunteering thing. The work will get done faster and have better quality if those doing it want to do it. The work will be sloppy and take a longer period of time if people are being forced to do it.

Perhaps if the number of volunteers is too low to participate in the service then try to get more people to help out by motivating them by offering rewards for their service. You could always try connecting the service with school by offering extra credit for those who participate. Or the class with the most helpers gets a pizza party. Trying things like this would increase the number of workers and the work quality.

If you would be interested and/or if the school budget allows it you could try paying students for their work to the community. Say for every job they complete they get three dollars, or for every hour of work they get five dollars. This would really increase the amount of students and the quality of the work.

If you would try forcing all students to work most of them wouldn't show up. The last thing a lot of the students would like to be doing in their free time is helping the community. So most won't go willingly but again if you try to force them they will most likely not show up.

One thing you could try is all the students that show up and work for a total of say six hours will get a free day. On an upcoming Friday the students that work for six hours or more will get the whole day outside to just play out on the field.

"When asking for advice it is better to ask multiple people rather than one person. Asking more than person can help you because not all people have the same mind set. Sometimes if you only ask one person for advice they can give you something they think is right in that situation but it can turn out not the right advice that you needed. But if you ask multiple people like three or four and see what the common opinion is you can take the right advice. And people tend to ask more than one people because they dont want to be provided the wrong advice. And if you are provided the wrong advice you cloud lose trust.

It is better to ask more than one person for many reasons for example if you ask one of your friends if what you should wear to a party and they give you what they they think. And then you go and see every body there is wearing a different style than yours. But that could have been avoided if you had asked the advice of four friends and then they could have given you the style that they thought was worn. Another example is if you ask one of your friends what you should get as a snack and they give you a bag of chips and later on you dont like the chips. But if you would have asked multiple friends what a good snack was they would have probably recommended a better snack than the chips. Or if you ask if you think you should ask somebody out and they say yeah or if you ask some more friends and they dont think its that great in idea to ask that person out.

The advice from a group would most likely be better than by asking one of your friends. Because if you ask one person whats in style. Than can give you some advice and then you take their advice and you wear it and people dont like it. Or if you need advice on what you should do in a situation and you ask one of your close friends what they thin you should do and they give you the wrong advice you cloud wind up doing the wrong thing in that situation. And sometimes they can lead you into the wrong things would get you in trouble. Or you cloud be put in a situation that you dont know what is right and you take the wrong advice could have a bad reputation or it could lead to you losing people you were close to. And you cloud hurt somebody if you do take the wrong advice which could lead to getting shamed.

And that is why asking more than one person is better than asking one person and that person only. because no matter who you ask youre probably going to get multiple answers but you can compare and see who has common advice. you want to ask the group so you dont get embarrassed in front of people or eat something that you dont like that isnt very popular among people. Or something you dont enjoy doing that person thinks is fun but it is a popular opinion to people. But if you ask a hand full of close friends or even just people you can see the common advice people will give of what they think they would do in your situation and you can see that more people think something else is right rather than the one or two people who thin something else is right.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Statistics show that 30% of people who ask for advice from more than one person end up making a smarter decision. Life is filled with decisions, some that may influence your whole life, and some that are not very important, that's why it's good to get some extra opinions. Many people have a hard time making decisions, and appreciate the extra help they get from their friends and peers. Having more than one person give you their advice on a matter could be all the help you need. It might also make you feel better about the decision you are taking. Asking your family and friends about a matter might also give you the answer you need. Gaining more opinions and voices if always better than not getting anything.

Some problems you may encounter in life will lead to you making a very important decision, which might not be the easiest thing in the world. You make decisions every day of your life without even realizing it, such as choosing to eat breakfast or choosing to finish your homework. Those decisions might not require you to get more advice, because you are already so used to completing them each day. Studies show that as you grow up, you are faced with more important decisions, that might not only effect you. Like making a decision to move to Africa with your family, which in that case requires you to collect all the opinions of your family members, because the decision not only effects you, but your whole family also.

Receiving more voices and advice on a matter might not only allow you to make a better decision, but also allow you to gain more knowledge on that subject, like a decision to go on the keto diet. Your friend might offer pros and cons to going on a keto diet, and why you might like it or hate. Each person has their own knowledge on a certain subject, like a doctor could offer you knowledge about health matters, or a lawyer could offer you knowledge about civil matters. If you had an important decision about your health, you might want to go to your doctor to get his advice on the matter, because he knows more about that topic. He also studied more about it and is more knowing.

Coming to a conclusion on a decision might be the hardest thing you do in your life. It might make you feel depressed and down, like you can't even make a simple decision, and that's okay. That's why asking more people about it might make you feel better. An example is myself, when it comes to making choices I am the worst to come. I hate coming to conclusions, because I always feel that I made the wrong decision or didn't think enough about it, that's why I always ask my family members for advice before making a decision, it makes me feel more relaxed and happy about my choice. It also makes me feel like I got the knowledge I need I make the right decision. That's why asking more than one person, could lead to you feeling better and more relaxed, and you could finally get on with your life, knowing that you made the right choice.

Last but not least friends and family know you the best. They know what you like, and they know your personality. They are the number one people who might offer you the best advice. An example is my friend Generic_Name, she once came and asked me if it would be good for her to take a year off of college, she wanted to relax and have a year to herself. I told her no. Why you might ask, because I knew my best friend and I knew that she would feel sad and depressed if she took a year off, because she's the kind of person who likes to work, she might feel overwhelmed at times, but overall she loves the thrill of getting a new assignment. So she took my advice and didn't get a year off. The next year she felt so much happier and thanked me a lot for giving her my advice. So in conclusion what I mean is that your friends and family in the end know you better than anyone else, that's why it's good to get their opinion on a matter, especially if it concerns your future. Trust me the advice they will give you will benefit you in life.

I'm nearing the end of this essay, and I just want to say that no matter how hard you think about a decision. It's best if you get other people's opinion who might know more about that topic or subject. It's important that you find the right people to ask when looking for advice. If you are ever having trouble making a decision don't forget that your family and friends are always here to give you their opinion and advice on a matter, because that's what matters the most. Don't be too hasty when it comes to making a decision, remember ""slow and steady wins the race"".",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Benifits on Limiting Car usage

Cars are one of mans geat creations but they are great because they are eassy not because they are good. In hevy populated areas cars make up about 50% of the greenhouse gas. and in just europe family cars make up 12% of green house gas. Some cars are efficient more than others but those tend to be more coastly.

First, green house gasses are a big part of the reson for global warming. Green houses also affect th ozone which could help to prevent it. Paris band driving because of how many people drive it started creating a smog and if that gets thick enough it could affect your respitory system. people who drive in countries where it was band they will be fine.

"Knowledge is power. This phrase holds true even till today, and will most likely hold true for all of eternity. The more knowledgeable a particular person is, the more power they posses. Now it is no mystery that the public school education system has and is failing many of this country's youth, but what is a mystery is how to solve this conundrum and fix America's public education system. One of society's most powerful tools is the internet, so why not use it to help educate our youth? Some teachers have seen this resource and decided to take advantage of it and help educate their class with various online videos and websites. But why not take it one step further, and use this marvelous resource to our advantage and help teach students online? Some schools have taken the initiative to do precisely that, and now offer classes online for students to take, also known as distance learning. Distance learning benefits students by allowing them more flexibility and versatility to learn, adds more positive options for learning, and removes certain restrictions and concerns that come from having to attend a physical location for an education.

Life is extremely unpredictable. Anything can happen that might withhold a student from being able to attend school, ranging from a fatal car crash or something as simple as pressing the snooze button a few too many times. Sometimes life dictates that going to school isn't going to happen. By allowing students to move the classroom from their classroom to their house, they are able to have more flexibility and versatility in their lives and receive the proper education they require. Online classes makes getting an education easier for students. Why wouldn't that be a positive? If classes start at 7:30, students may have to wake up as early as 5:00 in order to get themselves prepared for the day. If a student doesn't take the bus, online classes free up the students parents, and allows them to have one less responsibility in their, possibly, extremely busy day. It also saves them money, whether it be for gas or for a taxi. It frees up the student, by giving them the opportunity to not have to get dressed. It may take 30 minutes or even an hour for a student to shower and get dressed, but by removing this routine, that is an extra hour that the student is able to sleep. Many argue that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but by requiring students to attend a class somewhere else, many students sacrifice eating, in order to arrive to class on time, yet online classes can help students enjoy the benefits of breakfast. Online classes make students lives more flexible and versatile by allowing them to decide when to take the class.

One could argue, that the internet is the greatest resource available. Unlike a book, information on the internet can be updated and corrected, without having to print and buy an entirely new book. The internet is also free, and provides various explanations that can cater to various different people and their learning styles. But many teachers restrict their class, by not taking advantage of this marvelous resource. While in class students must learn by any means the teacher uses, and if the teacher fails to explain a certain topic, the student suffers. In class, students can not search up a subject on the internet, it would most likely be a disaster if they could. Many students don't even ask questions, because they are afraid of humiliation, and if they do, they do not continue to inquire if they are still confused because they don't want to frustrate their teacher or look unintelligent. With the internet, this doesn't occur. Users are able to ask the ""dumbest"" questions imaginable, free of judgment. It also allows them to be more thorough, thus allowing them to better understand the subject and content better. All of this is possible with online classes, because students can rely on the internet to get accurate information, explained to them in a multitude of ways. If they don't like one websites explanation, they can look at another. The internet provides a variety of different websites to learn from, thus, allowing more options for students. Some could argue that a person could teach better than a book or website, and while this is true to an extent, online school doesn't remove the teacher, it only allows for another option, which is always a positive. If students still want to go to class, they still can.

Having brick and mortar institutions comes with its restrictions. Whether it be a bank or a school, having institutions online makes life easier. Classes are held at a certain time period, and while this may be a plus for some, this definitely comes with restrictions. If a student doesn't arrive on time or misses the day, there is nothing more that they can do. With online classes, students are able to still learn and possibly learn even better than in class. Another issue many schools face is harassment, and online classes can help with this as well. Even though it is important for students to learn how to act and react in social settings, if a student is being harassed by a group of students, they now have the option to be able to avoid them altogether. A classroom is restricted by the teaching style of a teacher. If students aren't compatible with a teachers teaching style, they have to figure out a way to solve their problem on their own. Online classes remove the middle man, and allow students to learn on their own.

Education is vital and key to the success of any nation. If humanity hopes to survive, it must be able to adapt and learn to evolve the systems already in place to try and improve society, such as the education system. By using one of humanities greatest accomplishments, the internet, schools can vastly improve, in turn, improving society as a whole. Distance learning is beneficial because of the flexibility it allows, the opportunities it offers, and the restrictions it disables.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests.

There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Requiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social. Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.

These activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.

Another benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students. When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.

In conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The face is just a natural landform because, nobody lives on Mars it's just a empty planet. They NASA says that the face on Mars had became a pop icon but i don't think that just because NASA has images that it's ture. You can't always believe people.

Although few scientists believed the Face wan an alien artifact, Some People think the Face is bona fide evidenve og life on Mars. Evidence that NASA would rathr hide, lets say conspiracy theorists. The caption noted that the rock formation resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. This would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

Many people thought that is was an alien momument, but on April 5, 1998 Mars Globsl Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. A Man named Micheal Malin and his Mars Oribter Camera team wanted to prove that there were no aliens. Him and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. People should have been satisfied with knowing that there wasn't an alien monument after all.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor drew closer for a second look. They has to rool the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view to get the picture. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras mamimum resolution. In the 2001 image each pixel span 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the 2976 Viking original.

I think that the researchers shouldn't be having to look seversl times just to prove certain people wrong. If they don't believe then they need to go to Mars for themselves. It'd great that they got the comparsion but they went through trouble to get there. It was not an easy target. In face, it's hard work. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

Even though community service is good for cleaning up our environment, I still don't think that you should make us do community service. It takes students free time away and some kids probably won't have time to do it because they have a lot of other things to do like studying for tests, or doing there homework or even have time to be with their friends or family. If you make students do community service there's probably going to be a 30% percent chance that some students grades might go down. If I was you i would not make students do community service.

community service should be for people that have enough time to do it you shouldn't make all the students do it. Even though Community service makes our world healthier it doesn't mean that all kids should be force to do it because, kids are not the only people that liter or not clean up after their selves. It's everybody, and i don't think that kids should be punished for other people's mess, kids already have enough things to do like homework, grades, tests, personal life, and family problems if you make everybody do it your just going to put more wait on the children's' shoulders. I think that people who get introuble doing graffiti or get let out on probation or get introuble for drinking and driving should be forced to do a certain amount of hours. You should just let the people that like doing it do it and reward them with something like a homework pass or something that, and the kids that don't want to do it shouldn't have to be forced because they have to much stuff to do for or something to. If you do make the kids do Community service your making a big mistake, but hopefully this letter will make you agree with my opinion on this.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I am against the principal changing the school policy on the students at the school having to keep a b average to be on sports teams and other after school activities. Most of the students at school have a c average. So, they should not have to keep a b average before they play any after school activities or sports. Some of the students have something that helps them after school on their grades such as tutoring for math or even reading. so I don't think she should change school policy because she would have students failing in their classes. These students will probably not be able to keep a b average in their classes. So most of the students will probably fail that school year.

These changes will hurt some of the students grades the next school year. The principal might wont to look at what these after school activities has done for the school. I hope she will rethink this whole thing about wanting to change the school policy.

The reason i think this was a bad idea was because the students need certain after school activities such as tutoring. Sports my help some of the teams with team work.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Owning a vehicle helps get people from one place to another faster then just walking but some people really don't understand that there are advantages to not owning a vehicle. In the excerpts ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"", ""The end of car culture"" both by Elizbath Rosenthal and ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, all explain how limiting car usage can help lower emission and conserve resources.

In the excerpt ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal explains why limiting car usuage would help lower emissions. For example, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are polluting the eniviroment that we all live in and are destroying the atomosphere because of all these greenhouse gases swirling through the air because of the use of cars. Furthermore, referring to another excerpt ""The end of car culture"" from Elizabeth Rosenthal also, proves why limiting car usuage will lower emission rates. For instance, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down to two to three years before the turndown...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" As you can see owning a car can be a advantage to your personal life but the enviroment is suffering because of the fumes from the vehicles everyone own but if less people start to walk more, ride bikes or even hike the enviroment wouldn't be suffering from so many emissions.

Likewise, in the excerpt ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer highlights how limiting car usage can help conserve resources. For example, ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world...Cold night and warm days caused the layer of air to trap car emissions."" Going back to what Rosental was pointing out emissions are still triggering the atmosphere. But, that is not the only thing that is being blamed for pollution. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has...[a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Western Europe, accoring to Reuters."" Without any gasoline nobody will be traveling from one place to another so to conserve resources people are better off limiting the usage of their cars.

In conclusion, using cars less would help to lower emissions and conserve resources such as in this case gasoline. If everyone keeps driving aroud in cars the air is going to be full of Greenhouse gases and eventually resources to run cars will soon run out. Then without a car to take people where they need to go people will have no choice but to walk, ride a bike, or take public transportaton because everything id worn and ran out. This is why limiting car usage is a advantage for fellow citizens because it helps lower emissions and conserves resources.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Mona Lisa is one of the greatest pieces of artwork Da Vinci has ever created. It shows great craftmanship and 83% happiness within her smile, according to a new face recognition software created Professor Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, and Professor Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. It creates and analyzes a 3-D face to assume what the person is feeling. This could also help students in other ways, by scanning their faces and trying to help them if a problem seems confusing or difficult, but this would give them less privacy and less security. This new system may not even be accurate, in which if they analzyes and assumed wrong for the painting, then the students' expression would also be wrong, making this system completely false and unusable in any way.

First off, a painting is different than a person. You can't accurately assume what the expression is if a person painted it. The facial structure would be slighly different from the actual person, because there is no way to completely recreate a face, especially back when it was painted. It may be very similiar to the person, but it is not the same person, meaning that the software has incorrectly given this person inaccurate or false emotion in which they previously did not have.

If this software doesn't give the correct answers to a painting, then we can assume it wouldn't work a human. Humans can show more visual expression than the software can detect. There is no setting for nervousness or joy. If someone was crying tears of joy, the computer would see this differently, and say this person would be very sad instead of being joyful. Humans can also fake expressions. If someone was sad, but had a smile the entire day, the computer might sense some sadness, but not nearly enough to show they are truly sad and that the student shows more happiness than sadness as the time of scanning them.

Lastly, even if this went into effect, this is giving students almost no privacy or security when using a computer. Sure its helpful for learning in some ways, but they have to give the software new emotions like confusion. Even if the expression showing confusion is implemented, this doesn't mean its safe. From paragraph 6, it states: ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"". Why does this matter? This just gives more excuses on how student's privacy is being exploited. It's also quite useless. You could be thinking of something else besides the ad, but the computer would see that your expression is happy, so you would get a similar ad, which you may not enjoy at all. It just doesn't make any sense to put it in a computer.

This new software is a great concept and could used in many different ways that would be very helpful, but it doesn't seem advanced enough to be put inside lots of computers yet. It's also quite dangerous, since the computer is looking at everything you are doing, inside and now outside the computer even more closely.

Bringing this kind of technology into your lives could seriously damage your reputation, social life, or anything of the like if your computer got hacked. If the software is inaccurate, then when you want to use this feature on a computer, it would be wrong, making this a faulty piece of software, unable to accurately give the emotion you were hoping to give. This could lead to many problems in the future if this face recogniztion software is used in the future. It's just not good enough to be used in the real world yet. Maybe after some time, but as it is not, it's not ready. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Do you know what a Seagoing Cowboy is, After world war two was over many countries were left in ruin, so the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration UNRRA sent the ruined countries cows,horses and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys job was to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger was a seagoing Cowboy who made eighteen trips as a seagoing Cowboy. I think that Luke Bomberg would want others to join the seagoing cowboys because, It could make you more aware of other countries, it is also fun and you get to experience other cultures.

I think that Luke Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get the oppertunity to go to other countries and experience them. In the text it says ""Besides helping I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" the text says that because of the Seagoing Cowboy job he had he was able to experience other cultures and countries.

Another reason I think that Luk Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it makes you more aware of other countries. In the text it says "" It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" If Luke Bomberg had not become a Seagoing Cowboy he would not have realized the needs of other countries and their people.

I also think that Luke Bomberg would want you to become a Seagoing Cowboy is because it can be fun. in the text it says "" The cowboys played baseball and volley ball in the empty holds where animals had been."" Once the animals were taken off of the boat the cowboys were able to play games and have fun.

What would you do, would you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Think of all the benefits like the sightseeing, the fun and the growth of your awareness of all the other people in the world.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle?

For a while now since the early 2000s cell phones/smartphones has been a technological rise in the use of its kind. People use them daily for things like social media, internet surfing, reading, planning, alarms and more. There are many ways that the handheld ""easy to use"" technology can help people, but they also can be dangerous to us in many ways if we don't take fully responsibility in them and use them when we need them and when we don't. This leads to the harm of people who think they can be using their phones while they are driving.

Driving can be at times boring but using something to distract you from the focus of your own safety on the road isn't a good choice. They are plenty of reason why using cell phones while driving is bad. The most brutal things can happen while you're looking away just for a second. In my opinion the most brutal things that can happen while you're distracting yourself from driving is you killing yourself or someone else. The worst part about it is that you'll always remember what you've done just by your careless actions.

Most people would say it's not as dangerous or that if you're good at it then you can use your phone while you drive. That's not true at all because driving takes in a lot of focus and concentration in order to be a successful driver. Also, when you ARE driving you really must drive for yourself and everyone else because even though you're paying attention it doesn't mean everyone else is. It takes more than just the push of a pedal and the turn of a wheel. In my opinion while you're driving you should be at your most caution due to the risk and the things that could happen to you and anyone else.

Daily people end up either dead or injured badly due to the simple fact of a device that they should have mot being paying attention to. Since the handheld device has been put out it has caused thousands of deaths each year. In 2014 cell phones caused over 26 percent of the car incidents in the U.S. last year there where 1.5 million car incidents due to cell phones being involvement while driving. And of those incidents 58% of the drivers were teens. The rate of incident is increasing annually making driving even more difficult and complex then it already is.

So, the best thing to do is to just not handle a phone in anyway when you're driving. There are enough incidents already worldwide due to cell phone being a distraction for drivers. If you have an urge to pick up a phone or get texts or calls often while you're driving it'll be safer to just turn your phone off until you're in a safe position where you can handle it without any risk. Driving is something that should be done with seriousness and not to be tempted with. The roads would be safer and people would be safer if they start turning their phones off for a better solution to deaths by car crashes.

Should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Driverless cars should not become a reality. My first reason why driverless cars should not become a reality is that they can malfunction and badly injure or possibly kill the people inside of the car. Driverless cars can run over an animal or human and possibly kill the living being in front of it. A couple tires can pop and swearve off the road into the a road beside it and injure not only the people inside but inncocent people in a car that didn't see what had happened.

For my second reason i think that they could get hacked and get send into the wrong direction. People can get lost and never find their way back to a safe place. Someone can hack the driverless car/s and end up killing the people inside or outside the car by controling the GPS and other important parts of the car.

For my third reason i believe smart cars possibly like driverless cars can or will get a virus and it will mess with the engine and everything that is important about the car. I know from experiance that a car with a t. v. can get a virius if it is not fixed properly. I believe a driverless car can or will get some or many viriuses if it is not check out properly when it is getting fixed.

To conclude my argument driverless cars can be a danger to nature and the people inside or surrounding the car. Driverless cars can get hacked and hurt people more than cars that need a driver all of the time. Driverless cars can get many viriuses and malfunction and destroy what is most important to the car.

"People make hard choices every day, and sometimes they don't know what to do. Advice from other people can be helpful to you in so many different ways. Such as, other people have personal experience that you might not have, sometimes you dont know what to do and other people can tell, and having input from a lot of people can give you options on what to do.

Other people having personal experience that you dont have can be helpful. They can give you suggestions on what to do. People say that experience is the best teacher. If that is the case then wouldn't it make sense to take advice from other people, that have personal experience that you dont have.

Sometimes you dont know what to do, and your just confused. Other people can sometimes understand the situation better than you can, and help you though it. Because sometimes you dont have all the answers. Other people can also be more calm than you in certain situations, and therefor make the better choice.

Having input from a lot of people can be very helpful in many situations. They can also give you choices on what to do in hard situations. Sometimes you dont know what to do and other people can make the choice for you taking off a lot of stress.

"The Face. It is a natural landform. We know this because if we look at the picture from 2001 the face looks more like a hill than a face. However from the picture in paragraph five we can see a rock that sort of looks like the top part of a torso. Which could suggest that this is some mutalated giant. which indeed could lead to the existence of aliens.

Although this landform looks that way it has a ton of holes in it. which could have been from land slides such as our rock slide. It could just be an illusion. It could be just a normal hill and our camera has made it look more like a face due to the thick clouds. The Face could be an actual mountain that has eroded to look like a face. However if the existence of aliens is true and they made this ""face"" then doesn't that mean that they have seen what we look like and that they are amoung us watching us.

In conclusion the face is indeed just a landform because there are no such thing as aliens.

Dear principal. I think policy #1 is the best policy for the school because us teen agers like to be on the phone to talk to friends or relatives and during lunch all were doing is having free time anyways were talking to are friends and eating so i don't know why it should be a big deal on not leting us use are cell phones at lunch time and for free time in class you should allow us to use are phones because were just having free time were not learning any thing new but during class time are phones should be off like you said because its class time not lunch time or free time. That's why i think policy 1 is the best thing. But see you teachers can be on the phone at any time you want so that's why i say let us be on are phones at lunch or during free time because we like to talk to are friends cousins if they don't go to the same school we do and all were doing is texting or calling i don't see why that should be a big deal.

"In many schools today, teachers assigning school projects over the summer for students to complete has become quite apparent. Teacher are doing this to have students stay focused even during the summer. Teachers can give one of two assignments; either a teacher specific assignment where every student has to complete roughly the same project with roughly the same outcome that has very little room for variation, or they assign a student ran assignment that allows the student to do a project in something they have interest for and it can be quite personalized. Teacher projects usually are stricter in there guidelines and make the student typically work harder even if the student may not want to do that much work while student driven projects can have many students work extremely hard on something they have passion for. The only problem is you will usually have a slacker in student designed project that will always do the minimum. I see student projects to have better benefits for students as for those that want and enjoy putting in the work for something they are really interested in they will see more accomplishment out of that. Others may that teacher designed projects are better because they force ever student to work but they are wrong because the drive for success should come from the student not the teacher. Summer student designed projects are better for the student that teacher designed projects because it allows for students to take part in the design process and then execute a product of something that a student is generally interested in.

Summer projects or studying in the summer will always be super beneficial for your education. It allows for you to stay alert and prepared for the next school year. Just studying in the summer alone can make getting into the next year that much easier. Summer projects can be really beneficial to students. In some cases it can allow students to have more a variety in options for there project than doing one in the school year. For example; a teacher assigns an entire class to do a research project on a single type of invasive plant species prevalent in his/her state and they will have to present that in class at the beginning of the year. I take issue with this because it is quite restrictive on what the student can research as its limited to only one plant you can do, and many students will likely pick the same plant. Plus the students have very little do in terms of the creative process in how they want to gather data. If I were the teacher I would have given a project on invasives in the state(allowing for multiple plants to be studied.)and not limit it to just a research project. This allows for a students to really to be flexible and learn more. Students can now have the opportunity to organize community events for conservation. Students can make test plots at a park to see what removal method works best. Students can now study multiple plants at once to compare and create statistics and find out which are the most deadly and hard to remove. Students also have the choice to help with college students on finding new ways of removing said plant from our area and eventually at the state level. Students can also go really ind depth into a plant they find super interesting and they can find the true science as to why they continue to grow so fast. The possibilities are endless.

They best part is when it comes down to the presentation. It is very likely that majority of students will have different projects; some may have similar ones but very different findings so its really interesting to see a students, growth, trial, and success through the process of completing the project. While also talking about their final conclusion they should also discuss about how they changed in grew as a person and about what skills they earned that they can use later in their life. Students can truly learn new concepts off of other students. If students were tasked with completing the teacher created project, the majority of students would really not have learned as much from each other.

This was only an example. The possibilities for student lead/created projects are endless because in comes from the student. The example mentioned was limited to conservation but there are student projects have to be. There are projects that can allow students to really branch out and potentially inspire them to their future careers. Students designed projects give students the chance to be a leader and be of something meaningful to them personally. Anyone can complete a project when it comes from a teacher but if it comes from student it can really create growth. These students will have plenty of time to complete their project as the have an entire summer to do so. The summer should not be a stressful time but it shouldnt be a time slack off and not grow in your learning. Everyday we are learning. Maybe its time for you to help someone else learning. Student designed projects give students the chance to prepare themselves for future challenges in the adult world. Others say that student designed projects dont push students enough to really create a product worthwhile; they are wrong because if a student truly care they will go above and beyond to see the it is completed full to the best of their ability.

"Policy 1 is better for the students because some students like to have cell phones and to use them but during a free time like lunch, before or after school and some no. Cell phones can be use in school but not during classes because it disturbs the class if it rings or you can hear the sound of the phone clearly.

I think that the principals should let us use the cell phones during lunch periods and they should let us bring them to school but we should turn them off during class and turn them on after school or before school, before classes begin.

We could also leave the phones turn on in classes but with low volume or in vibrate mode if we have an emergency but not being using them when we are in class working and neither when we have a test.

If we are having a familiar emergency, then I think that when we get to school to leave the phones in silence or vibrate mode in case we need to receive a text message from some of our parents and just look at the text then put the cell phones away in our backpacks or in our pants.

As the students like to be texting and calling other friends and all of that with the cell phones, and they should do it after school, before school, in lunch period or during a free time or periods. The principals should let us bring them at school because some of the school are not permitting the students to have or bring cell phones to school but I don't know why if it's a natural thing that people like to have cell phones and specially teenagers.

I would suggest to all the principals to be agree with policy 1 and to follow what it says there, to let students bring cell phones to school and let them use them at lunch period or during a free time or period, and turn them off during class or put the in silence or vibrate mode before getting to class or to do a work.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear principles, i think that this is a good idea to do that because kids that are doing sports will keep them at a good grade. also it is a good idea to do that because it would give teachers a break.

doing that would get the kid to do better at there work so they would realize that if they don't get a good grade to play sports then they wont play. Parents are gong to get on there case about there grades and kid are gong to get all mad and actually kids and parents and teachers are going to have an easer work to do because the kid would do their work like the need to. Also i don't think it would be a good idea to do this because if the kid would give up and not try because the teacher or the principle will take them out of their sport.

I have both sides on this because it would work and not work at the same time.

i think lowering it down to a c- would work because that is the lowest it can get to an d. so this way students can play sports and have a good grade at the same time.

This would give schools a better chance at most of the students a good felling that they are doing a good job by getting to play in the next game. me personally i hade experienced this kind of feeling that keep me going to every game. and that was the greatest felling because i knew that i can do what other people said i cant do.

So it would be cool to see the whole team out on the field because they all have a good grade.

"Many people believe that the landform on Mars was created by Aliens. Many Web sites, magizenes and people do not have enough information to correcty assume that the Face on Mars is an Alien monument or creation. Many people just guess without really having adiquite information. We do have enough information to know that when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Mars and took pictures of the Face it was not Alien made.

We know for a fact that the Face on Mars is not an Alien creation. The first Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) or the Viking 1 took blurry photos of the Face on Mars and we could not clearly see the object. Twenty-five years later the MGS was sent to take better quality pictures of the Face and when it came back, the photos were ten times more sharper than the Viking 1´s. Now we could clearly speculate that the Face was just another Mars landform.

On Earth there are simialr landforms like the Snake River in Idaho. We have found that the Face is a lava dome under the surface of Mars. We understand how much of an influence the Media can have and you shouldn´t believe them. Again, they do not have as much information as we do on the Face on mars. Thanks to our new pictures from the MGS, we can safely say that there is no Alien temple or monument on Mars.        ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I have over heard that you are considering changing the school policy for the privilege to play sports. You are currently deciding to change it from a C average to a B average; am i correct? I personally will support the decision you make one-hundred percent, but I do have to say that the B average would be an excellent choice.

Many of my peers have about a C average and they are very good in sports. If the grade average that they need to play is a B average, it will cause them to have to work harder, therefore, make them retain more information. Yes, I do want my peers to be able to play sports and have fun, but I believe that school always comes first because a country` s success starts with its education. Your education instills in you the great work ethics that you need to accomplish greatly in life.

TEACHER_NAME, I believe that if you do decide to change it to a B average, it would leave a great impact in the school. My peers would focus on school more which will help them tremendously in there adulthood. I am all for it; to change it to a B average!

"There are pleny of advantages fellow citizens get for having limited car usage. Fewer people are getting there license and using cars each year anyways.

in addition, it is true that people without cars would have to go through the rain or the cold weather every time the weather looks ominous and people would have to worry about getting to school or work on time. But, Limiting or taking away cars would clear the air of smog and less people would have stress.

First, by limiting car usage you can reduce smog. ""After says of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If all cars or vehicles were to stop being used the air would clear easily and we can all live in clear air. ""The smog cleard enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If they made like a schedule for which days cars will be banned and what days aren't, then the air we breathe will be better than ever and everyone will still be able to use there cars how they feel like.

Last, People will become less stressful when not using a car to get to places. ""It's a good opportuntiy to take away stress and lower air pollution, ""said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle wiht his wife""(Selsky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota""). Without cars theres people walking along the side walks talking, people not having to worry about saftey on the road as much, people riding bicycles and skateboarding, and just a great way to excerise just by walking outside. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,' said bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus""(Selsky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota""). The fact that people dont care about the rain makes me think that people are enjoying this car-free day and there's no reason to stop it.

In conclusion, A few days or even weeks without cars is a great idea for reducing stress and air pollution. There are even more reasons why we should have a car-free day like time conservation, emission lowerage, safety improvement, and resource conservation.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Studying planets is often hard because of the conditions in space, and also on the planet Venus there are also very harsh conditions that humans cannot survive. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Exploring Venus can be a very risky planet for us to expore until we get better technology.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" talks about the positive and negative aspects of the driverless cars. I am totally against the development of these cars. They are not safe, they are not necessary, and anything can go wrong. I do not like thinking that the production of these cars can lead to harm or bad things in the future.

I am against the development of the driverless cars because they are not safe enough to be on real rodes. If there are children in the car and something happens to the car it could hurt the kids and be very dangerous. Also not having control of the wheel at all times is dangerous because even now when people don't have their hands on the wheel there are multiple risks like crashing. Another thing that is not safe about these cars is that if it goes out of control on the road many lifes could be in danger and no one would know if it was the driver or the car.

Another reason I am againt the driverless car is that they aren't necessary. Cars now are simple. People know how to press on the gas and turn the stearing wheel the way they want to go. It isn't necessary to make a brand new car that can drive on its own if people know how to drive with their hands and feet perfectly fine. A lot of people in the world drive. If they don't like driving they catch busses or taxis. Even with the driverless car the car still needs a driver. And if most people drive there is no point in making a driverless car that you still have to drive. There is no point in paying a lot of money for a driverless car when you stil have to drive it. Also why take chances on a car that you still have to drive when you have a car that you know how to drive? You would pay all that money just to still end up driving.

A third reason I'm going against the development of the driverless car is that something can go wrong. There are so many things that could go wrong with the driverless car and no one should take that chance. If a sensor messes up and doesn't detect a wreck coming up instead of notifying the driver it could keep driving and crash into the other vehicals. There are so many different issues involving construction, wrecks, and traffic on the road and if one thing goes wrong with the car it could mess up everything and something very dangerous could happen. If it doesn't sense that their is construction ahead and it keeps going something bad could happen and people could end up paying a lot of money.

Having a driverless car isn't worth the risk. There are many reasons the driverless car doesn't need to be on the roads. They are not safe, they aren't neccessary, and anything can go wrong at anytime. They shouldn't put the driverless cars on the road because if anything goes wrong everyone around could be in danger. The companies need to make sure that A sensor will never mess up and that everything is 100% perfect with the car before they put it out for anyone to use it.       ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Everyday or every other day people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that it is safe because they can drive using two hands or there knee at times . however, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations.

Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving and that it can wait until they get home. people who work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and scary situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.

Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people and can also be harmful toward themself. I understand that people have a busy schedule and need to get around place but you can put that to aside and put your safety first .

that's the most important thing people forget they never think about what situation they can be in , if they don't watch the roads and be careful were they going because not only are they putting other people lives in dangerous , there also being put at risk. And some people have a family to go to and parents be expecting their kids to come home from school and work at times. And not to hear news from an officer that there child was in a terrible accident, Which is never good for any parents or anyone to hear.

I think drivers shouldn't use there phone because it's to risky for them not to focus on the road and they get distracted by other things on their and may end up losing control of their car because of something they could have avoided which some teenagers and adults should realize it can wait.

"The Benefits of Online Learning

Students would definitely benefit from attending online classes. For most students, school is known to be a stressful learning environment. This makes it harder for students to learn and feel comfortable in what they're learning. If students had online classes, they would have more freedom in their learning. Also, students would feel comfortable and have less stress. Attending classes online would make students have a desire to learn more. Students would not only benefit from online learning, but they would also enjoy online classes.

First and foremost, students would benefit from online classes because they would more freedom in their learning. When students are at school, they tend to have a schedule and they're told exactly what to do and when to do it. From personal experience, I've learned that most students don't enjoy being forced to do something. Being told what to do and when to do it, makes the learning environment more stressful for students. Therefore, the more freedom students have the less stress they'll receive. At school, students have some unreasonable consequences. If students did online learning, they would benefit from not having as many consequences. Student would benefit from having less consequences. Therefore, students should have the right to their freedom, especially when it comes to what they're learning.

Also, students would feel more comfortable and enjoy online classes. The average student, plays sports or does extracurricular activities, making their schedule more difficult. Online school would provide students with a more flexible schedule. Students would also be able to do and try new things outside of the classroom. Activities keep students engaged, making them want to learn. This also makes learning more fun and helps students further their learning. The less stress students have the more successful they'll be. Students can't have fun with what they're learning if they're stressed. Having a lot of stressful causes students to not do well in school. For some students, stress can be helpful, but for the average high school student stress isn't beneficial and cause more issues for students. Students should be able to have fun and enjoy their learning for their benefit.

Others may say online school isn't beneficial, but students are going to pay more attention and have less stress. Students already don't enjoy the idea of coming to school everyday, and being told what to do and how to act. Some of the rules at school can be unreasonable for students causing students to get into more trouble. Online classes would take away that trouble. Therefore, making students want to learn and do better. If students were more comfortable in their learning environment, they would be more encouraged to learn.

Finally, students are constantly stressed everyday from school. Making it difficult for students to enjoy what they're learning causing them to slack off. If students felt more comfortable in their learning environment, they would be more successful. Every parent and teacher should want to see their student succeed. Online school sounds like the perfect plan for students. Every student should be able to enjoy what they're learning. In conclusion, online classes can beneficial to students causing them to have a more successful future. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Theres so many positive and negative when we imagine the idea of driverless cars. I believe that driverless cars are very dangerous and can cause many conflicts. First, I know that even with the law of don't text and drive, people still do those things. Secondly , if we allow driverless cars I know that people who are tired from work are going to fall asleep knowign the car is in control, but at the end when theres trouble, they will still be asleep. Lastly, I believe that people will start sueing companies and people will not feel confortable of being stalked while driving.

First of all, there are many reckless drivers around us anyhow. How can we be sure that we are safe when driving?

In the passage "" something not avaible to the drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" I can not imagine but we do know for a fact that texting and driving is very dangerious but there are also people who are out there doing it. These situations can lead to mass accidents. If you are given the chance that your car does not need you and you do get bored off of the heads up display, what would you really do? Since our society is all about iphones and samsung , I do not think that its safe to be in a car with your cell phones on. I sense that teenagers are especially going to disobey the law because they just tend to think its going to be okay, which in reality its not. We should be very concerned of everyone driving safetly.

Seondly, I believe that exuausted and drunk people are going to take this advantage of having driverless cars. What if you car needs your help, and youre asleep and that you're too drunk to get self concious? This will lead to more troubles because than people that are drunk will still drive and think that their car has it all in control.""They can steer ,accelerate, and brake themself, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" The driverless can be very dangerious if in case in need of a human skill if someone is really tired and drunk.

Lastly, I believe that your rights are being taken away when you're beign stalked on while driving. I wouldnt want to be stalked on when i'm driving or anything. it violates someones privacy when youre watching them because some people od have to do certain things when they are parked for example like having to use an emergency or changing clothes. ""While the driver watches the road , the car watches the driver"" Do you really think that drivers are going to watch the road when they dont have to? I also believe that peopel will start sueing companies because who is at fault if theres an injury or accident?""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is al fault- the driver or the manufacturer? I think that people who are being responsible and driving with great cautions will be upset and it would not be fair to them if they are under control of their own car and than there is someone els thats not drving but lettign their car being controled by a computer than they get in an accidents. I do knwo that there are accidents from many reasons, but I believe that driverless cars can cause a lot of problems.

In conclusions, I do not agree the fact that driverless cars should be allowed. It has many safety issues for the community and it will cause a lot of problems. It will violate someones privacy,someone can take advantage of driverless cars when they are drunk or tired, and lastly peopel will be upset. I think it depends on the indivuals who are driving. People should start caring more for others when driving because someones life can be at risk if they driver recklessly.

Driverless cars will lead into many big problems as well as to many life lost if youre not prepared when your car needs you.",0,persuade_corpus,0

"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are debating between two policies about cell phones. One of which would make the students very happy. The other would be popular with teachers and staff. Each policy would be popular with one group, and unpopular with the other. Both policies have their pro's and con's.

Policy one would allow students to have their cell phones out between classes and during any free time they have. This would be very popular among students. They like to be able to text or call anyone and talk to them. This would make the school day more enjoyable for the pupils. On the other hand this could lead to a higher percentage of cheating. students could text their friend the answers to a test in a class the student just had. This would upset teachers because they have to focus more on cheating.

Policy two would not allow students to have their cell phones at school. This would focus students more on school work. there would be less distractions. This would also not raise the percentage of cheating. However pupils would not like this policy. They want the freedom to text or call their friends. This would make the school day less enjoyable for them.

Weighing the pro's and con's of each i decide to pick the second policy. Students don't need to text their friends in school. What kids need is a good education. They cant do that if they are texting their friend about what they are doing after school. It may not be popular with the students, but it is the smartest decision. What ever they need to say, they can wait until they seem them or are out of school. That is what I think, at least.

"Eyeing the clock with big grins on their faces, students sit on the edge of their seat, ready to ditch the books for summer break's embrace. That is until the teacher breaks the excited energy for everyone in a monotone voice, stating that a summer project will be assigned. Summer projects have always been a point of annoyance common among the students, but some teachers have since considered the idea of allowing students to design their own projects, similar in fashion to a science fair. The main concern that comes along with the idea of student-designed projects is if students will be able to create projects that live up to the expectations and criteria set by a teacher; however, student-designed projects are good outlets for creativity, teach students to be independent and self-directed, and allow for students to seek out new information on their own, which they otherwise would not have done.

Usually, students have the expectation of creating and completing their projects to the instructions of a teacher, but this practice has only put a damper on student's creativity. Student-designed projects allow students to demonstrate their creative and even analytical sides as evident by the science fair. The science fair is a widespread form of a student-designed project in which students are to create projects based on inquiries and questions they have about the world. In these projects, students are only given a loose guide to tell them what they have to do; the students decide what the general content of the project will be about, and it is here where students must get creative in order to figure out not just an inquiry for a project, but the answer to said inquiry. Resulting from the science fair are a multitude of projects and students who have demonstrated excellent thinking and significant creative output in their pursuit of scientific inquiry. Because of this, it is easy to see how student-designed projects take creativity into account and allow for students to truly shine when they're able to create their own inquiries to solve.

In addition to the opportunity for increased creative output, student-designed projects are self directed, and as a result, they teach students to use their own thinking as well as teach them to be more independent. Teachers can offer assistance to students, but ultimately, it is the responsibiity of the student to complete the bulk of the project on their own (given that it is a student-designed project); consequently, students use their own analytical thinking and become more independent as they work on their self directed projects. Independecy is a key quality to have in American society, as many occupations such as entrepeneurship and teaching involve an individual making conscious decisions to do certain things. In the case of entrepeneurship, the individual makes decisions on how and where to invest their money. As for teaching, teachers make decisions to teach material a certain way that may be different from another teacher. From both scenarios, it is evident that independency is an important trait to have because several occupations are mostly self directed.

Finally, student-directed projects allow for students to explore new topics and learn new information that they otherwise would not have done on their own. Students typically will not do extra work or go above what is expected in a carefully laid out rubric for an assignment, as their is no reason to do so if there is no reward for it. Even if there was a reward for extra work, some students still won't pursue the extra credit because they simply aren't invested enough into their work. A great way to circumvent this issue would be to incorporate a self directed aspect to a project so that students are actually researching and learning new information about topics that they are truly interested in. It is sometimes forgotten that the point of an assigment is to learn new facts, ideas, and concepts about the world, and when a teacher-designed project is assigned, the idea of learning for the sake of actually learning is thrown out of the window, as students would be more concerned with their grade. In comparison, student-designed projects allow students to do as they please, and gives way for the opportunity for students to get really invested into their work when they are able to decide what the project is about.

Student-designed projects have many advanatges over teacher-designed projects, and as a result, student-designed projects are superior to teacher-designed ones overall. Student-designed projects allow for student's to demonstrate their creativity, teach them to be more independent, and allow for students to truly become invested into their work. It is important that students get the most out of ther education, and by implementing student-designed projects into summer break, it keeps students' minds active and helps refresh them on old information as well as new information based on the topic they chose themselves. It's for these reasons that student-designed projects are superior in many ways to teacher-designed projects, and is also precisely why student-designed and self directed aspects should be the basis of all summer project assignments.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa smile""

talks about how they have a new system and it can detect how a person is feeling. This new tecnology can be very helpful for students. I believe it can be helpful to students because there are some people who feel depressed and it is complicated to tell if they are happy, depressed, or angry.

This can help students and adults to see how they are actually feeling because some people don't even know how they feel. Some students might say ""that computer doesn't know how I feel"" but the computer FACS(Facial Action Coding System) comes from a good sorce. The people who created ""FACS"" were Thomas Huang and Prof. Thomas Huang was from the Beckman institute fo advance at the University of Illinos working woth Prof. Therefore, they the system ""FACS"" is a trust worthy computer to identify your emotions.

This system can help students with their lifes. To demonstrate, in paragrapg 3 it states ""Eckman classified six basic emotions happyiness,suprised, anger, disgusted, fear,and sadness."" when a student is feeling depressed (no students should feel like that) a teacher doesn't know how the student is feeling out of the six basic emotions that Eckman descrided. Thus, the system will help teachers know how the student is feeling ;and if the student is not feeling good the teacher or the adult can ask why are they feeling that way and build a conection or a bond with the students.

Teachers can find this system useful because when they are teaching they can see if their students are confused or bored. To illastrate, in paragraph 4 it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements"" which means that using video or images is a new way to find out how people are feeling. Therefore, teachers can see how their students are feeling and see if their class is boring or not and they can see if their stuents are learning anything. This is an example of how this new system can help students and teachers.

All of these are examples of how this system ""FACS"" can help students and that is is valuable.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Before I get into whether or not FACS is a valuable tool in the classroom I ask you, is this valuable? Depending on how you're looking at it and who you are you could have many different opinions on this. FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System.

If you think about what this software is about, it is about reading a students facial expression to determine what it is. It's not impossible to do without this software. In what situation would you not be able to read a students expression that you needed to use a software to determine it for you? It says in paragraph 5 of the passage ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" It says in the passage that humans can still calculate their emotions without this software.

I believe that this type of technology is completely useless and a waste of money if this were to be implemented into a classroom, that would be many uses and practical situational use for this software. The classroom is not one. If you were to implement it at a high college level course then it might be effective and worth the money but only if it effects that major that they are going into. If FACS implementation was thought about between kindergarten through 12th grade then there is a problem.

There is no practical use for this software anywhere between that grade level. You would never need to use this software for practical use in the school day. There is no gain from having student learn it before college because they most likely won't retain the informatio and even if they do it is most likely useless to them.

In conclusion, why implement this software that can change a photo or painings facial expression? It's complete and utterly useless for K-12th grade to learn about this software or even have hands on time with it. There is no practical field to go down with this. I see this FACS software as just a gimic that people who are interested will use for their own fun. So to answer the question, no. I think that this software is valuable but not in the classroom. This software would only be useful at a college level course or in a professional career like in a hospital.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The automobile has been around for decades but it's only now that we can see the devastating effects car emissions have on the ozone layer. With the obvious change in the environment, people are starting to use cars less. If people would limit their car usuage there would be less polution and happier people.

Car pollution is probably the number one disadvantage to car usage. In 2014, Paris had to ban people from using their cars because the smog was too bad. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Limiting car usuage in Paris would be very benficial for their people and enviornment.

In sources one and three though they had the right idea about the advantages of limiting car usuage. In Germany, one suburb is car free and residents reported to be happier than when they did have cars. In Bogota, there was a large turn out of people to particpate in their car free day. A business man says "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"".

The automoblie maybe out the door anyway. In source four, ""driving by young people decreased twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009."" Less and less people are getting their licenses and more people are starting to take the public transportation and carpool. This is really significant because itt's the young people that are gonna live with decisionn that are mad today.

Car limting advantages out weigh the disadvantages. More care free cities and days and more people riding bikes and taking public transportation and carpooling can lead to many great advantages. Some of the advantages would be less air pollution and happier people.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"After reading this controversial essay on Electoral College and how it affects other and our ""American People"" I feel personally a bit ashamed at our own country that we allow all this nonsense to have happened. In my opinion I would want too ban the choice of Electoral College, because first off we're looking way too deep into our system of voting, is it really necessary too compare our states number of votes with another's just to possibly get noticed? Why dont we take things into our own hands and not count on voting for some stranger to do the work for us.

In one of they many paragraphs I had read, it simply stated ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that out to be (overruled)"" that doesnt sound like everyone here in America is fully williing too agree to all of this, and I wouldn't blame them.  I don't understand why we cant just vote directly for the president ourselves! I mean after all, he is going too be our leader.

If there is already an apparent list of five reasons all about retaining the Electoral College because of its democratic pedigree, just is another reason as too why I'm against this kind of voting system. With having the first reason listed as being ""Certainty of Outcome"" should really make the person reading that question themselves on if they're making a right decision or not. You would have too go through a lot of trouble and paperwork as it is whenever voting for someone, At least I would like too know that I'm not basically giving my one vote away for technically someone else to do it for me.

I think that policy 1 is a good policy. I agree that we should be able to bring our phones to school.

There are many reasons why i think we should be able to bring our phones to school.

What if there was an emergency and no-one was around you would need a phone.

In your classes and you had nothing to do you could be texting on your phone because that is what the kids are in to these days.

Some kids have there mom come and pick them up from school and after tutoring classes they would need a phone to call home and tell a parent.

Cell phones are really good acceries for kid and adults.

They give you something to do at all times.

School is not a place for a cell phone but we should be able to bring our phones. If everybody cut there phones off during classes and would not play on them during class some teachers would get a lot more done.

There would be one less thing to worrier about while your at school.

From what you have noticed is that i like cell phones, and i think we should be able to use our phones at school.

"Dear Principal,

I don't think its right to require all students to perform community service. Some students live in dangerous areas where its unsafe to go outside. Others may not be able to work due to how late their parents get back from work or it may interfere with doing homework. Some students won't do any work because their's no incentive to work other than you telling them to.

You should take safety as a big reason not to require students doing work for community. In the day and age we live in there are too many things that could harm somebody.

There are sexual predators, gangs, serial killers, and kidnappers. If a student is in a gang and is out doing a group community project and a rival gang member sees that student everybody else could be in danger of a drive by shooting and multiple people could be seriously injured or even killed. With the numbers of gangs rising in the U.S. there's no telling who could be in a gang or not. Sexual predators is also a major concern. When you have a couple of teenagers on the side of the road cleaning it would be easy to kidnap someone and rive off.

Another reason why you shouldn't require students to work is because some parents don't get home till really late at night. Usually by the time my mom and step dad get home its already dark outside and to late to do anything. Working after school would be the main time students would have to work and after school is when students are doing their homework. Even if your doing your community a good thing having students grades drop doesn't look good on the school.

I know a lot of kids who wouldn't work even if they were forced to. If all you do is simply tell all the students they have to do community service then very few people will want to work. Even if you bring in rewards for working some kids would say, "" Woo a bike! My birthday is in a month I can wait."" On top of not wanting to work they have leadership classes that are solely based on doing good things for the community for those who want to.

All of these reasons are why you shouldn't require students to do community service.

I believe that voting for the President of the United States should be based on the present idea of the Electoral College. There are many elements that play into the reasoning for this. The Electoral College is a process developed by the makers of the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors with each state holding a certain amout of these electors based on the population of that state. Candidates try to gain the vote of electors focusing on larger states with more electors. It was something created by the makers and founding fathers of the Constitution and something so important should not be changed.

Presidential candidates focus on gaining the majority vote of large states in order to obtain more electors. A large state such as California containing over 35 million voters should have as much of a say in electing a president as a small state like Wyoming only containing 500,000 voters. The Electoral College makes sure that the ""majority"" of voters doesn't decide an election and everyone has a say. The ""winner takes all"" system evens out the playing field for all those little states who want just as much of a say in determining a new president as a large one does. The idea of a Electoral College adds a sense of competition persuading a candidate to influence states with a high number of electoral votes making the race for interesting. Swing states are a huge deal in this process for they mainly decide the election with the ability to change an election in a heartbeat.

If a majority voting system was incorporated into the election system instead of the Electoral College the process would become much more complicated than it already is. Voters should be able to vote not just for a new president but for a slate of electors who aid in electing the president.. These electors are appointed to represent the people in choosing the candidate of their choice who they feel is best suited for the position. Many people against the Electoral College argue that the system is not acceptable because of the possibility of a tie due to the even number of electoral votes. This reasoning is highly probably and has never happened before.                          ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Seagoing Cowboys was part of a program called the UNRRA that helped rebuild cities after World War 11. The Cowboys transported animals such as, horses, young cows, and mules overseas to the ruined cities. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke became a Seagoing Coyboy after his high school graduation. The reason he joined was because his freind Don invited him to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke didn't disagree because he knew it would be a opportunity of a lifetime.

If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys you would be a part of a very important program. 44 nations united to help the contries in ruins after World War 11. The Seagoing Cowboys shipped the animals to help the countries regain their food supplies, animals and other things that the countries needed.

Being one of the Cowboys didn't mean it was all work and no play. During the trips across the oceans you can see China, Greece, and other contries you've probaly never seen before. After a hard days work of cleannig stalls and feeding animals you could play baseball and volleyball in the holds where the animals were kept. Games like fencing, boxing, and table-tennis also kept the Cowboys ocupied.

There are dangers that come with this important job. Luke was a watchman on his second trip. His job was to check on the animals every hour. After he made his report to the captian he slipped on a ladder, slick with rain, and started to fall twards the Atlantic. A piece of metal stopped his fall but he couldn't work because he cracked a few ribs.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It includes great sights, fun, and hard work. If you become a part of the Seagoing Cowboys you are a part of a great program that saves lives. The job is full of suprises and danger, but it is all worth it because you are helping others.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I do not agree with the author in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" when he describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions works. The use of this technology is to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable to me. There are reasons why I don't agree, and I know that i'm not the only person who disagree with this argument.

One reason is that schools shouldn't allow anyone to put that technology into their computers because that technology has nothing to do with school or what the kids are learning at school. Another reason is that the way people feel is how they feel, it's not meant for the whole world, the school, or anyone to know how they are feeling if they didn't tell that person. If that person didn't tell anyone that's because they wanted to keep what was wrong with them to their self.

In paragraph three it says that the Facial Action Coding System that is enable in computers can tell if a human is feeling happy, surprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness. If a student is feeling happy or surprise its okay for people to know, but when a sudent is feeling angry, disgust, fear, and sad it's not because you don't know what that person is going through or how that person is living.

This technology that someone came up with is not a good idea. I said it's not because I wouldn't want anyone to know how i'm feeling if i'm not in a good mood. If i'm angry or sad about something I would keep it to myself and not tell anybody because I wouldn't people to kee bringing it up to me when i'm trying to forget about it.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principle

I agree with your statement about not letting students participate in sports unless they have a b average. One of the reasons i agree with you is because if students don't have good grades in school they could fail and they cant play any sports so it is really important that the athletes concentrate more in school and do all of their work. If you could get there coach to talk to them about there grades and how it could affect them and effect the team. But one thing i don't really like is that most students might have trouble with the material that they are learning in school so if the teachers see they are confused they should talk to them. If they need more help they should schedule something with the teachers that way they get more help and get a better grade but also have time to be in the sport they play. This is a great article telling students that play sports to get good grades. But also if they need help they should talk with the teachers or with you. If there are a lot of athletes that need help the teachers should host a program to help them out.

"Schooling has been around for thousands of years, and, as the rest of society has evolved, the traditional schooling technique has virtually stayed the same. Children still remain at desks, listening to their teachers lecture; kids still take home worksheets for extra practice called ""homework."" Standardized tests are still given, and kids are still excelling. However, as time goes on, more people have begun to question this type of schooling, and why it has not changed for over 1000 years. A recent change people have suggested, with the rise of technology, is ""distance learning"", a way to ""attend"" school from the confines of ones own home. While this idea seems promising, it is not a good change for the schooling system because, for the vast majority of students, it will cause unneeded distractions, a less stimulating environment, and the inability to distinguish home and work life.

As children grow and learn, they are more likely to choose play over work. Because of this, kids are often distracted from their assignments in school, whether it be with the thoughts of their Buzz Lightyear action figure they can not wait to play with or with the drama on their cell phone. When children are placed in the sterile environment of the school system, these distractions are minimized because the child's surroundings are sterile, solely containing learning materials and peers who are trying to accomplish the same task. If a child were to attempt to learn at home, no matter what age they were, they would be surrounded with the temptations of play, and, even if they had the power to restrain, it would affect their ability to concentrate and retain information.

Continuing, the home simply does not stimulate the mind as completely as the school does. In a school there are hundreds of resources at a child's fingertips: libraries full of books, teachers full of knowledge, materials full of the ability to educate. While the home may have educational resources, the vast amount does not compare to that of a traditional school. Not only does a classroom have abundant learning materials and information, but it also has students who help each other grow and prosper in their learning environment. For hundreds of years, the traditional desk-and-chalkboard schooling system has been used, and over those years, people are still excelling and test scores are still rising. This is because the school stimulates the mind like nothing else; it allows children a place to let their curiosity wander and lead their education. To take away the school will take away the stimulation.

Finally, a common problem found in adults is an inability to separate home and work life; this begins at a young age when children fail to make the clear distinction between home and school. By allowing students to participate in school from their home, it will make this distinction even less clear which will not only affect the child's present life but also his or her future life as a working adult. when there is no specific time and place for a child to learn, their home and education lives blend together, often affecting both for the worse. An example of this is seen in Tara Westover, the famous author of the memoir,

Educated.

Westover was home schooled but was often given little time to learn because of her home obligations. This caused her to lack education as well as the knowledge that home and school are two distinctly different things. If students were able to mix their home and school lives, the negative results of an inability to distinguish The Home and The School would far outweigh the positives.

Many may disagree with this position, saying that this opportunity, to learn in the comfort of ones own home, would greatly benefit those who suffer from illness or other challenges that prevent them from attending school. However, the ratio of those who are unable to attend a traditional school to those who are is very small. Many students would take advantage of this ""distance learning"" opportunity and use it for an easier education rather than a better one. There are several types of accommodations one can receive for illness or any other obstacle that hinders their education; allowing any person, without such disabilities, to receive these accommodations endangers them and their education.

Although the idea of learning from home has been widely acknowledged, it has also been widely debated. There are several positives when one looks on the surface of this idea, however when one truly delves into the logistics of such a change, they will realize that there are too many negatives that accompany it. The home is too distracting and does not allow the proper stimulation for learning that a child needs to succeed in life; the lack of a distinguishable home and school life will also harm the child as he or she matures. If a change that is supposed to bring better and more accessible schooling to children in fact causes the opposite, this change will not benefit the education system. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Work over the summer sounds boring enough, it creates less time to have fun over the summer break. However, what if it was the students to design the summer project, that can be based on a interest, a hobby, or an activity. In addition, if this was a possibility, creativity can shine on a student project, and a sense of pride upon working, so while doing work, student can enjoy of what they enjoy, share their ideas and passion. While others believe, that teacher should designed the summer projects; However, if the summer project was a student design, it'll benefits students and gives freedom to work on what they are interested.

If were to be students designing a summer project for school, it brings out the creativity and how its unique from comparing other student's projects. Also, this summer project can spark a students passion or ideas to share, and create a voice for themselves. Moreover, student designed project, can cause less vulnerability of copying others projects, it creates a space where everyone is unique in their own way. I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.

From the project, there was not a lot of commitment for sharing ideas. Procrastination happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot of encouragement to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.

In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Car free cities can have a advantage due to being able to get from point A to point B without causing any harm to the enviroment, but the price is risky to have a car, in some countries, your better without a car. Such as in ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars""By Elisabeth Rosenthal. And in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". By Robert Duffer.

German residents in VAUBAN are know as ""suburb pioneers"" because of them not having any motor vehicles. An additional affect is that in order to put your car in a parking garage it will cost you an additional $40,000 along with a house. Another in paris ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined for 22-euro $31 U.S dollars, 27 people had there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"". An extra effect was that  the city had ""cold nights and warm days causing the warmer layer of air to trap car emission"".

In another passage they show that in Bogata,Columbia ""millions of Columbians hiked,biked, skated, or took buses leaving the capital city free of traffic jams"". It was the third straight year says the Author:Andrew Selsky,""cars had been banned in order to set there goal to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". The day without cars was part of a campaign in the mid 1990s.

Another source by Elisabeth Rosenthal was ""The End of Car Culture"" showing and sharing information that in America recent studies show that people in America are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer license,

Car free cities have a positive affect around everyone by helping reduce air pollution like smog,and to avoid injuries from traffic jams.                             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Cell Phones and Driving

Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When notifications sound, kids my age and many adults have now been conditioned to immediately engage. Our engrained Pavlov's dog reaction doesn't stop just because we are at the wheel.. Whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity gets the better of them and they feel they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It doesn't matter how good you are at multitasking. It should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are a few reasons for that.

Let's start with texts, social media, and any other alert. To stop and read this alert you would have to take your eyes off the road for longer than the recommended time of one second, it takes to check the rear-view mirror. It is extremely dangerous to text or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your life you are risking. We endanger every one of our passengers and anybody we are sharing the road with.

As for making phone calls, this to should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case just pull over to the side of the road, take the call, then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason for you to pick up your phone while you're driving.

Whatever it is can almost certainly wait until you get where you're going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many lives to tweets or texts if people are under the threat of losing their license, steep fines, or if they truly think about the potential consequences. I don't think I've ever liked one post or seen one funny meme that could replace the loss of a friend or loved one.         ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"""Driverless Cars Are Coming""

Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore ? They started coming up with new ideas on how to make cars work better. Most people like me are fascinated with cars that can drive themselves . Who wouldn't want a car that could do that?

It sounds like a good idea but there are some things most people wouldn't like about these cars. The cars that already have been created are not completely driverless. That means you still have to pay full attention when the car is working by itself.

Google had a car that could drive half a million miles without crashing but it still wasn't driverless . The driver gets notified when pulling in and out of driveways. The Google cars would also alert the driver incase of a accident or roadwork .

Some of the cars made had sensors in them. The sensors would allow a much better respond than the human drivers . BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" had a sensor that would make sure the driver had hold of the wheel. Most of the cars developed so far couldn't really do much but steer,accelerate, and brake themselves. The human driver still had to remain alert incase they had to take over and start driving in case of an accident or roadwork ahead .

So why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? They think the idea of it is fun , which it is . Most laws about driving are focused on keeping the people in the vehicle safe. New laws will be made incase there is an accident . They will have to see whos fault is it- the driver or the manufacturer .

Would you still want a car that you had to drive? Doesn't really sound like a good idea to me . Sounds fun but it's a lot of work .",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In ""The Challegenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiote the danger it present. Even though the author knows the condition of Beus he suggest it anyway because tyhe author is drieven with curiosityThe author claim that Venus could once be a just like Earth today. The author also claim that Venus is Earth's ""twin"" making it closest to visit.

The author claim that scientists are so fascinated by Venus becuase it was it well have been the most Earth-like plant in our system. The author says that long ago Venus could've been cover with oceans and might have even support various forms of life. The author suggest that there are familiar feature on Venus to Earth right now such as: rocky surface, valleys, mountains, and crator. However, the author also stated that Venus conditions are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on Earth.

The author also claim that Venus would be a good place to vist because of how close Venus is to Earth. Venus is call Earth ""twin"" along with Mars because of how close they are to each other. The author claim that this would be a good option for a planetary visit, given the crucial consideratin of the long time frames of space travel. Even though the average temperatures is to extreme, NASA are working to a solutuion to study Venus by humans.

In conclusion, the author suggest to visit Venus because Venus could very well have been the most Earth-like planet and because of how close Venus is to Earth.

"Dear Principal,

I don't think you should change the school policy so students have to have a least a grade B average. I think this because a lot of kids who do sports might have a C and not a B. Also kids who don't have a grade B average might just drop out of the sport and not fix there grade and then they wont get any exercise. Exercise is very important so kids can stay healthy and live a healthy life. So as you can see sports are very important to kids and also sports keep kids in shape and motivative and it shows them how to work as a team. Although grades are important so are kids health. Another reason why you should change the school policy because if you take out all the kids with a grade C point average then there wont be as many people playing sports or in other school activities.

"A thick Atmosphere containing 97% carbon dioxide, Venus is a dangerous planet. It's extremely high pressures and dangerouly scorching surface, it is beyond comparison to Earth's environment. Although its proximity to us is closer than that of mars, its reputation precedes it as a challenging planet. Despite the dangers, Venus is a worthy pursuit because it was once an Earth-like planet in our solar system.

To start off with, it's geographic features are similar to that of Earth. In the article, on paragraph 4, it says, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various life forms."" On paragraph 4, further down, it says, "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and inlcudes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Based on these two evidence, Venus's features; which once included rocks and oceans, can be found on Earth.

Next, the technologies provided by Sophisticated Organizations and companies can help through the exploration process. On parargraph 5, it says, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions...would allow scientists to float above the fray."" As we move further down the paragraph, it says,"" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" From these two evidence, NASA's solution can be benefical because the explorers wouldn't be exposed to the surface; they can avoid the unfriendly conditions, and they can gain acess to the solar power needed to power the machine, it's a win-win.

Then finally, the studying process. On paragraph 7, it says, ""

Some simplied electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber stimulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons."" From the same paragraph, it says, "" Systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistent to the pressure, heat, an other forces."" From the simplied electronics to the mechanical parts; which both have been proven useful in the conditions of venus, can be used to collect data. the mechanical parts won't melt and 3 weeks for resisting the conditions is extremely useful, these are the solutions that can be used o study Venus.

To end this essay, Venus is worthy due to the similarities it posesses. From all those planets, it was Venus's proximity and it's features that are analogous to that of Earth. Scientists can learn what happened to Venus through the technologies given. These technological solutions provides safe ways to travel and to collect data from Venus. Despite the dangers, it is the only planet that was Earth-like, it's time frame for space travel is much less than that of Mars. This is an opportunity of the time, and the author is trying to inform us that we should take the opportunity and explore. We have the technology, we know that venus is close to us, and the fact that it was once a twin of Earth, that's fascinatiing. Aren't you curious to find out what happened to Venus?",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Once there was a girl named Generic_Name, who was going to try Chipotle for dinner for the first time, was asking her best friend, Generic_Name, what she should order. ""Oh!"" Generic_Name exclaimed, "" you should get a bowl with white rice and chicken. It will make you feel like you are in heaven!""

"" No, no!"" pouted Generic_Name's other best friend, Generic_Name, ""you have to get barbacoa as your meat and a lot of cheese, it will melt right in your mouth!""

"" Come on don't listen to her, I guarantee that you will love chicken way more than barbacoa!"" shouted Generic_Name.

When Generic_Name got home that evening from school she asked her parents whether they think she should get barbacoa or chicken as her meat.

"" Well I personally think that you should get barbacoa as your meat, it has a wonderful juicy and flavorful taste."" said her mother.

"" Yeah, every time I go there I have always gotten barbacoa, it has this spectacular taste."" her father added.

So when they went to Chipotle that night, Generic_Name ordered a bowl with white rice, barbacoa, and a lot of cheese.

"" Mmmm, this is really good guys, thanks for the advice!"" said Generic_Name happily. Asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because people have different opinions, some people may have bad advice or opinions, and it may help you change your mind about something.

To start off, asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because everyone may have different opinions. Not everyone likes the same things and it also maybe nice to hear what other people have to say about things. If you were to go around your school or work and ask people what they think could be better about their working environment, not all of them are going to say the exact same thing. Some people may say that they want bigger and better bathrooms, more food options in the cafeteria, a neater and quieter work space, a longer lunch time, and many more. That is the thing with asking people for their advice and opinions, you never know or expect what they are going to say, but it can also make it harder for you to choose something since so many people gave you advice and they were all different. That is one reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.

To continue, another reason why asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you is because some people have bad advice and opinions. You may ask the wrong person for their advice, they could be untrustworthy and a bad influence, also some of your friends who you think are your true friends and will give you good advice maybe be the exact opposite. Someone will possibly try to get you in trouble and give you the wrong advice on purpose. For example, there was a boy named Generic_Name, he was an all A student and did fantastic in school. One night, Generic_Name was trying to decide whether he should study for his French or Algebra test first, so he called his friend, Generic_Name. He told Generic_Name to take his advice to not study at all and for him to sneak out late at night and go to a huge party that Generic_Name is having at his house. But then Generic_Name deiced to call Generic_Name to ask for his opinion.

""Oh don't listen to Generic_Name, his brain is about a size of a peanut, he is just trying to get you in trouble, you know he is a bad influence. I personally think you should study French first."" said Generic_Name.

"" Yeah I guess you are right,"" agreed Generic_Name, ""Generic_Name is a bad influence and he should be studying as well.""

If Generic_Name did not call Generic_Name to ask for his advice he would have left home late and gone to Generic_Name's party. That is another reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.

The last reason asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you is because it may help you change your mind about something, just like Generic_Name when he asked Generic_Name for his opinion. If you were thinking about doing something you weren't really sure of and asked your friends or family members what they thought, they can lend you pretty good advice that could possibly change your mind about doing something you were not completely sure of. For example, you could be thinking about getting a blue sweatshirt and ask your sister what she thinks, ""Oh no don't get the blue, get green instead, it really brings out your eyes."" she says.

That is my final reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.

In conclusion asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because people have different opinions, some people may have bad advice or opinions, and it may help you change your mind about something. Not everyone always thinks the same way about things and some people have just have bad advice, if everyone were to ask multiple people for advice, they are more likely to make the right and better decision.      ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Principal:

Being a student at our school, I think that it is a wise decision that you have made to only allow students with a B average or above to participate in sports or other such activities. Here are the reasons: students will have to work harder in school, they will get rewarded for their efforts, be more conscientious students, and therefore be able to better contribute to your school.

Students that have good grades are the ones that coaches want for their teams. I have learned this personally and think that if you are a student with good grades you are more likely to work harder in their sport or other activities as well. Getting a B average may not be easy for all of these students, but if they truly want to play the sport or do the activity they will want to put in the effort to get the grades needed to participate.

If students get a B average it is more likely that they will excel in their extracurricular areas, because it will be rewarding after getting good grades. Playing on sports teams has shown me that the kids who are willing to work hard at school are also willing to work hard in their sport or other talent area that they may have. This is another reason that implementing this rule is a good idea.

The school will also benefit from this change by having more conscientious students in its walls. If students have to be pushed mentally, they will be more willing to be pushed physically. I think that having better students will also translate into better athletes and kids in other activities.

In closing, I would just like to say that I agree whole-heartedly with your decision to only let students with a B average or higher participate in sports or other activities. As shown throughout this letter, I think that our school will benefit greatly from this and will grow not only academically, but in our other areas. I hope that other schools will follow our lead and raise the standard for grades in schools nationwide.

"Facial Action Coding is used to find the emotions of people based on how their muscles move in their face. As should by Mona Lisa she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 perfect fearful, and 2 perfect angry."" Therefore the FACS has show. Mona Lisa's emotions just by the coding. As you can see FACS would be great to help out around the world.

Facial Action Coding could help a lot in schools with helping people learn better. Dr. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" This shows that the classroom with FACS means a classroom where learning can become better. If a student is confused FACS can modify the lesson or help get the student unconfused. Also instead of students zoning out in class Facial Action Coding System will notice it. After FACS notices the student zoning out it can make sure the student zones back into the lesson. FACS can tell is someone is faking being happy. These are all reasons why VACS can help with everyday life.

In the end Facial Action Coding System could change how the school systems and the everyday life of humans are changed. With VACS no ones emotions would be saves, so it would be easy to tell if someone is scared, tired, sad, and happy. Mona Lisa was just a example what would you do it that was you?

"Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that you are deciding allowing cell phones in school or not accepting cell phones at all. The teenagers at your school will be more than happy if you do allow these phones. Cell phones should be accepted into your school during free times because no issues should occur, teens will like school more and in case of emergency.

Offering the young educators their cell phones in school should not be an issue. As long as the kids in the school do not use the phones in class there will be no harm done. If a young adult does exercise their phone during a class hour then the phone should be taken away for a week. this will cause kids to not want to use their phones in class. One of my friends has used their cell phones in class before. He was caught and was told not to use it again. After this he never applied his phone again. Kids should be allowed to have their cell phones in school.

Another reason to allow cell phones is teens would like your school and you as a principle. I have always wanted to go to a school where you had the decision to interact with your phone during pass times or during lunch periods. Many kids would want to go to this middle school. These cell phones should be allowed in school.

One last reason to allow phones is in case of an emergency. If someone is hurt but is alone in a class they should be allowed to call for help. 911 is an important number to dial in the case of any type of emergency. Schools will need to allow phones for many reasons one of them is to avoid harm.

Your school should allow cell phones because of no issues, kid will like your school and in case of an emergency. Thank you for taking the time to read my l      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Have you every heard of the ""Face on Mars?"" Some people even think that the face was an alien. NASA (the people who found the ""face"" on Mars) could say otherwise. NASA has many diffrent ways that this is not an alien. The three are that no alien monuments anywhere, that NASA spent countless time trying to make sure that they were wrong, and that the shadows and the lighting make it look like a face.

The first reason why it is not an alien is because they looked for an alien monument and didn't find one. This either means that NASA took all that time and did not find one, or there is not alien monument which means that this being an alien is slim. Not having a monument means that the ""aliens"" didn't have a home or a place to worship. NASA even had a camera ten times sharper than what they found the face with,""MIchael Malin and his MArs Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos""(7). This goes to show that the monument and the aliens do not exist.

The second reason is that they tried countless times trying to find more. They spent many years trying to find answers but they never found them. The only answer they got was that the alien they were hopping for wasn't present or was present. On April 8, 2001, that was thier last try. They had amazing pizels but still got nothing, ""Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution"" (10.)

Finally, the shadows made it look like it was a face. Even though it looked like a face, we never know if a shadow hit it good enough that it made it look like that. NASA states that ""only this one had unusual shadows to make it look like an egyptian Pharaoh,"" (2.) This states that unusual shadowing made the mesa look unusual. The later years, the mesa looks less and less like a face.

This shows that the ""Face on Mars"" looks more and more like a shadow. Many years have been put into this ""Face on Mars."" Yet there is not that much they found. NASA would have got a lot of money if they found it. Yet they turned it down because they knew that it was not an alien like they would have hopped.               ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do like the fact that people have been doing community service at the school but some of my friends think that its great and some think its not so great. Personally i like the fact that people are helping out their community and really the people that are helping it will probley pay off in the long run when they go to apply for a good job or even a good college. The people that aren't helping their community it will probley not pay off at all cause they are not doing good things to get ready for big things in their life.

Maybe the next time you have kids come and help out at the school you should have them clean up the play ground like pulling weeds or picking up trash cause sadly the play grounds are not well maintained. Also with all of thoughs kids getting sick maybe clean off all of the equipment to help make sure kids are not getting the flu or even the cold. Also with all of the good things to come and go in these kids lives I personally don't think these teens should be required to help out, it would be nice if they did but some of them may be bad influences on all of these kids. I think that if they want to help out let them but if they don't, don't make them.

Inclunclusion if these aren't wanting to help out with their community then don't make them cause its their future let them be in charge of it. If kids want to help then so be it cause they must want to have a good future, cause they are probley working hard in school and obviously are willing to do what ever they need to be successful in life.

"The summer is a time for students to enjoy a break from schoolwork. Most students spend their time on vacation or relaxing. Summer projects may impede on students' time to relax, and they may take away their freedom. It is the students' break, so they may want to decide what projects they have to do. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the students to do projects they are interested in and that work with their summer schedule.

Student-designed projects will interest students more than teacher-designed projects. Many students don't want to do anything school related over the summer. By assigning them projects, they have to take time to do something they don't want to do. However, if the projects were student-designed, they would be more likely to complete them since they designed them themselves. These projects would make the students use their creativity, which would lead to more of them expressing their interests. They will be much more motivated to do a project that interests them than a project made and given to them by a teacher.

Many students travel and have plans over the summer. Consequently, they may not have time to do teacher-designed projects. If the students designed their own projects, they would be able to design them to fit their schedule. With this flexibility, students will stress less about finding time for the project. Therefor, students will produce better projects because they aren't stressed. This flexibility allows students to do their best and get the most out of doing school work in the summer.

Many people think that the freedom of student-designed projects will allow students to be lazy and off topic. However, this freedom gives the students the opportunity to turn schoolwork into something that interests them, thus motivating them to do well. The summer is a break for students to relax and not worry about school. School projects take away from that, but the student-designed projects give more flexibility than those made by teachers. Therefor, summer projects should be student-designed in order to grab students' interest and not impede on their break.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I know that the Face is a natural landform. I know for sure it was not made by aliens because aliens do not exist. We do not have a trace of alien lifeforms in our solar system. The Face was shaped into that form 25 years ago. We do not have proof that the Face was made by aliens. What it actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West. Even though Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it did shoot a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Mara Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

January 26th, 2011

I believe that you should make community service required in our school. You should make community service required because it shows kids to be thankful for what they have, makes them get into real life situations, and a kid can't take one hour a week to help in their community? Community service makes kids think different in every day situations like should i bully some kid that has no parents or should i give him a complement?

When i downtown to the animal shelter to volunteer i feel good and thankful for what i have. I feel that if kids do community service it shows them ""wow i have a lot, thanks mom and dad!"" kids fight with people everyday over what they wear, how they look, what they say. We are all lucky if we can walk, have a roof over our heads, have someone their to support you, have clean water. People across the world can afford food everyday. Here in America we should be thankful for what we have!

When we are older we are going to deal with getting a house, buying food, making money; real life things. If we don't know what is ahead we are not going to know how to handle things. If we can just help out in our community like real young adults we are going to have a better way of living to know what happens ahead of childhood.

If you are a kid you play games, computer, and watch Television some people can't even afford a television. If we can't use one hour a week to go and help our community and sit down and sleep, that's bad! we have hours and hours of saying I'm bored. Well go help the community! In America we can be better people everyday, why not make it better by making community service mandatory.

I think if you want America to be a better place then it would really help to make Community service mandatory just to make people stop complaining. You are living that's all that matters, your trying your hardest to make life better. Maybe we should try to make some ones life better.

Thanks,

"It would be good to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it would be a great opportunity to help out, a lot of chances to go sight-seeinng, and would open up a world of awareness.

Firstly, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program would give you the chance to help out. Many countries were left in ruins after World War 2, this program helps though. The Seagoing Cowboys program hires ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals. What better way could you help out.

Participating gives out huge amounts of help that is put to good use.

Second of all, there are lots of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke Bomberger explains, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" Luke, like many others, got plenty of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke went from Europe to China to Greece and even Venice, there are so many places to visit, joining would be the best way to see them.

To add to that, participating would open up a great world of awareness. Joining helps bring about an awareness to people of other countries and their needs. Joining would not only be an amazing adventure, it would help with seeing other peoples point of views and how they need help.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is helpful and fun all in one, and would be the best choice to make. It may have it's downsides, but the good parts in joning, (helping out, sight-seeing, and awareness) make up for any and all bad parts.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Students have hardly any free time because of the school principal's decision to make every student participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students are very busy.

The principal's decision will drastically change the lives of students.

Students have many activities to do throughout the day.

The principal should not have made the decision to make students participate in an extracurricular activity because many students play on travel sports teams or have a lot of homework.

I disagree with my principal's decision to force all students to participate in an extracurricular activity because students participate in activities not connected to school, students are busy or have something else to do, and many students have little time with their families.

The principal should not have made every student participate in an extracurricular activity because many students participate in activities not connected to school.

A large amount of students participate in travel sports.

Travel sports teams have practice most nights of the week.

They travel long distances to participate in games or tournaments. The competition in these games is really high.

The principal's decision to make students that play travel sports participate in an extracurricular activity could put too much stress on the students.

Many students also take classes outside of school based on their interests.

Students could be forced to give up their classes because they have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

A large amount of students join clubs or groups outside of school.

Students enjoy being in clubs with their friends that do not go to their school.

Some students have to take care of younger siblings or do chores.

Students may not be able to complete the tasks their parents ask of them.

Some students are dedicated to a sport or skill.

Those students spend hours at night training for their sport or their skill.

Because of the principal's decision families may have even less time together.

Many extracurricular activities take place at night.

That is the time most parents get home from work.

Students also have less time to see each other because of the long school day. Before the principal's decision, students had hardly any time to spend with siblings because of school.

Now students have even less time with siblings because they have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students also had little time with their family because of activities not connected to school. Today, students have even less time because they have to participate in activities connected to school and activities not connected to school.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think this change in policy is unneeded for many reasons and I hope that this letter will help you come to my understanding. Many students at this school participate in sports and some of them are not very good at school work but they at least have a passing grade. Some students have a lot on their hands not only at school, but at home as well. If you make this policy official then it will put more stress on students to keep up with their grades more than ever, and if they have more stress on them they will perform poorly at tournaments and meets. Some may not be able to even compete because they are at home trying to do work to keep a b average.

I can see why you would want to keep students grades up and keep the student body as smart and hard working as possible, but some students can't handle that kind of pressure added on to what they've already got going on. So in conclusion you should just keep the policy that you and so many other schools have kept for years and years to come. In this way maybe we can have a few more students winning medals and district championships than in the schools past years.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Have you ever had an project over the summer, and you thought what If this was student designed ? Well I defer, I truly believe that if summer projects were ran by students it will be a major mishap. There are many reasons why summer projects should not be students designed. First, because many students are not going to forget about the academic part of the project. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over their summer break. For example over the summer I had to read the maximum of six books over the summer, but I could never finish or complete my goal because I would most likely forget about reading over the summer, and I would forget what strategies to use to help me complete my goal. Finally, this why I'm siding with all projects should be teacher designed.

To begin, many students believe that summer break is not to really focus on the time frame that they have to learn or set their minds on nothing pertaining to school work or anything work academic. This is an reason why projects should not be designed by students, and I feel that teachers are going to give students strategies that pertain to what the students have learned during school hours. Also I know that teachers will give students an time frame that will allow students to complete projects, and help students focus on learning during break. I learned that many reasons why I could not complete my math goal during the summer. This was because I was not setting an time frame for myself to keep track and making sure I can reach my goal, also I would very so often forget my strategies that i used during school hours to help guide me. Next, this is why projects should be designed by teachers. I know that teachers would give us many things that will help us remember, and focus such as: notes work assignments that we have done during school hours, and also an time frame of when It can be completed.

Next, teachers providing projects I felt It would be more easier on students because students need an extra boost over the summer mainly most students would feel that they might not remember, or cant retain the information and can not complete. If teachers where to design projects for students,I know that teachers will have an due date on when and how to turn in your projects on time. This suggestion is really good for students, because If students made projects that they wouldn't know how to turn in projects, or when to finish them. My teacher makes sure her students are completing and finishing projects on this website called Schoolagly. This process is to make sure that any projects or work assignments are turned in and done correctly, And also with this process teachers can add notes and definitions that will help with projects and work assignments. To become more perplex on this topic this is the reason why students should not design summer projects,and because sometimes student wouldn't know when to complete or finish these projects.

Finally, there are many reasons to why summer projects should be made by teachers and not students. These reasons are based on the needs for students, and how some students need an teachers to help them concentrate on projects during the summer. Also so students need help from teachers to manage time frame on when to complete projects. Then students might need help from teachers on how to retain the information learned during school hours. But if it were up to most students they would look at it in a different perspective a lot of time students would want to design projects, because they believe that they have all of their materials that they will need for projects and sometimes they don't which makes it hard. Also this makes it complicated for students to make and time frame on when to finish the project,also some may need assistance with remembering what strategies they used to remember during school hours. To sum It up, I truly believe this is why teachers should make all summer projects to give students an helpful path to continue learning.

In conclusion, there are many reason why students should not design break projects. Many students are going to forget about the academic part of the projects. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over the break. This concept is really important,and also helps make sure students using the break time for projects,and has an adult that has put material down to help along the way. Teachers creating projects will also help by not letting the students to get off course during break. Just think about it would you want your students, or child to have projects over the break and not have to proper structure for thier projects?",0,persuade_corpus,4

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it introudeces a new invention, a computer that can reconginize emotion. There are 6 basic emotions it can recongnize such as: happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. I strongly believe that the computer would be helpful in some classrooms but not all, depending on the subject. A facial expression does not always tell a emotion.

This topic is very debatable depending on whom you ask, this would be a controversy to say the least. There are many ways around this ""emotion reading computer"", it only takes a fake smile to surpass this. I do not believe an instructor of a classroom should also worry about what emotion the students may be in, regardless they have to do the work assigned. There are very many opinions in this article which do not pursuade other to buy their product such as when they stated: ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do (D'Alto6)."" I truly am against the idea of the emotion reading computer due to the fact that many aspects of it seem uneffective. Students may have a tired face or example and the computer may think they are upset about something even though they're just tired.

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" may have a good idea, but wasnt thoroughly thought out. They also do not have factual evidence, they state the word ""predicts"" which shows they don't know for sure how the computers will turn out.

"I think we should keep the Electoral College because i think it is fair majority rules one person has just as much chance as winning the votes as another. The electoral College will help with votes because the people that don't vote the person that gets the electoral votes still get the same amount of votes even if some people didn't vote at all it won't change. But if it was by popular vote then the people that don't vote will make a big impact because you will need more votes to win the election.

I also see it as unfair because the people that voted for one person and the majority is for another person their votes won't have any affect and will be pointless. All the people that vote for one person are useless if the other person wins the majority. With the Electoral College some electors could defy the will of the people and vote for the opposite of what most people voted for. Say the 35 million people in california and 15,000,001 million people vote for one person and 14,999,999 people vote for the other those 14 million peoples votes are pointless with the electoral college and its not fair that the canidate doesn't even get one of those votes.

In conclusion i say just get rid of the electoral college because of all the votes that won't count and all the people that voted and not a single one of their votes goes to who they voted for. If it was by popular vote one person could get majority of the electoral votes but less of the popular votes and if there was no electoral college some of the presidents might not have been president.                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.

Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.

Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.

Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.

Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Scientist said by 2020, students will take classes at home using their super computer instead of going to school, which has not happened completely yet. However, Generic_School offers online classes to students and they can take some classes at home without going to school. Although some may say otherwise, school system, musician, and my personal experience proves that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Generic_School is well-known as having a great school system. Generic_School offer students online classes, which they offer for a reason. For classes in school, there are limited number of students that they can take for each classes. One of my friends wanted to take AP Psychology, but the class was already full so she was not able to take it. Luckily, my school offered AP Psychology as an online class, so she is now taking it through online class. Some may say students will not learn anything from online classes, but if students are really eager to take the class and want to learn, they will have no problem of learning courses.

There are some fields that people have to put a huge amount of effort like sports, arts, and musics. Especially for musicians, they usually practice at least two hours everyday. Doing all the school works and practicing is very hard, so some people use distance learning to make their lives a little bit easier. For example, a friend of mine, a young violinist, wants to major in music. She had won lots of competitions which requires her to practice at least 5 hours a day. Rather than spending time going to school, she decided to take all her classes through online. As a result, she has been chosen as one of the finalists for international violin competition. Distance learning system can help students to focus on the area that they are interested in. Some people may say students should be focusing on school work first before anything else, which is not correct. If students already know what they want to do in the future, it is better to spend more on it than going to school and not wasting time.

Distance learning benefited lots of people including myself. After I heard about the online class program, I thought it could help me to make my junior year easier. Due to the youth fellowship program, I am missing at least four days or more every months. It is really hard to catch up if I miss this many school days, but for online class, I do not have to worry about missing classes, because I can start working on it after I get home. Online class gives students more flexibility than actual classes. Some may say students should challenge themselves instead of finding an easy way like taking online classes. However, online classes are challenging and it is not wrong to choose easy way when there is an option.

Support of distance learning from schools, musician, and my personal experience supports that distance learning is benefiting students in lots of ways. The number of schools that offers online classes has increased compare to the past. Nowadays, most of people have access to the internet, they can take classes at home easily without going to school. It is not common to have easy access on technology like here in America, people should take more advantage of using well-developed technology.                 ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Extracurricular activities can be a fun after school experience for students. While extracurricular's are a fun experience, I do not think they should be forced onto students. Three reasons extracurricular's should not be forced include, A lack of interest, not having enough time, and extracurricular's could hurt students school performance. I personally enjoy after school activities, but some students may be effected by them more than others.

First off, Students having a lack of interest in what their doing. When people are forced to do things they have no interest in doing their work is effected. Not to mention that they often work in groups with other people so their work is effected too. The people who really enjoy what they're doing will be effected negatively by the people who don't care. When this happens people stop working together and when you're not working together as a team then everyone becomes disinterested and will not do their best work.

secondly, Students may not have a lot of time for extracurricular's. Some parents may not have time to pick up and drop off their children to these after school activities. Also, Students may participate in extracurricular's outside of school that may be effected by there school extracurricular. Students that would have to do both extracurricular's may not have time when they get home to do their school work and their home duties. This could put a lot of stress on students and they could be effected by this stress at school.

On the topic of students being stressed, Their performance in school could be negatively effected by extracurricular's. When students do not have time to do their homework at night they are forced to stay up late. Students sometimes go to sleep almost in the middle of the night and could get sleep deprived. The next day, students could be tired and falling asleep in class. When you fall asleep in class you are not paying attention to the material or doing your work and after a certain period of time of this happening your grades could start to drop.

Extracurricular's are fun activities for students when they're done with school. Extracurricular's will have a negative impact if they are forced onto students. Extracurricular's should not be forced for these three reasons, lack of interest, not having enough time, and after school activities could hurt students performance in school. To me extracurricular's are fun but they may effect some more than others.                                                                                                      ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"What would it be like with no cars? with limiting car use there will be big advanteges. What do you think about the limit on car use?

Limitg car use has advantages.""When I had a car I was always tense,I'm much happier this way""(Rosenthal). With a car life can be overpowering, but without a car thats one less thing you need to stress over. ""Drastically reducing greenhouse gases""(Rosenthal). thats one way to reduce the greenhouse effects.

Limiting car uses has advantage. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforces driving ban to clear the air""(Duffer). a car ban will help clean our cities from record bracking pollution.""Pitted sidewalks had been replaced, rush hour was drastically cut, and restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up""(Selsky). since the effort without cars our cities can prosper.

In conclusion without cars will be our best advantage. without car no more stress,greenhouse gases reduced,stopping car pollution, and cities can prosper. this is the effects without car.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"To maintain a healthy, active mind, many students are assigned an educational, summer-long project.

These assignments vary from science experiments to maintaining a reading log; anything that would keep kids busy on their summer-long vacation.

However, there is the question of if these summer assignments should be created by teachers or by the students themselves.

To create the optimal educational experience, summer projects should be self-administered so that they are individualized for every student, so they are easy to manage, and so students can learn how to be self-sufficient.

Providing students with the opportunity to take control of their own summer project makes the assignment more individualized.

Compare the idea of assigning a summer project to the scenario of a student choosing their classes; they are much more likely be perform well in a subject of their interest than in a random class enforced upon them.

Relating this back to summer projects, students tend to better commit to a project that aligns with their interests.

Also, Students are more motivated when they have control over their decisions.

When people take a personal initiative towards what they do, they carry more pride and are more successful in their work.

Personalization of summer projects produce more meaningful experiences that serve as a solid foundation for education.

As students are away from school for a long three months, there is no other person better than the students themselves to manage a personal project.

Teacher are not aware of the responsibilities or vacation plans of their students, so the expectations they would set might not be attainable for some students.

For example, a student would not be able to keep up with an at-home project if they were away for the majority of their summer.

Rather if they were to choose their own project, they could more easily manage how to carry out the project in consideration of their personal circumstance.

In general, students would be better at following their own judgment when creating and completing their own project.

Without any teachers to answer their questions over the summer, it is better for the students to be their own bosses.

If students were to create their own parameters for a summer-long project, it would be easier to manage because the students would be more knowledgeable of the requirements than if the project were assigned by a teacher.

Leaving a student to create and complete their own summer-long project would instill responsibility.

At an age of maturation, students need to learn how to be self-sufficient.

The responsibility of a summer-long project is comparable to that which is handled in the regular education students go through the other three seasons of the year.

Students must learn to make decisions for themselves in school as they would have to for a summer project.

A self-assigned project teaches many of the qualities innate to being an functioning adult.

Many people must work by their own deadlines to make a living.

Without responsiblity, which is taught be self-assigned summer projects, people would not be able to hold jobs to pay bills.

The long vacation over summer is a oppertune time to hone personal skills necessary to getting by and thriving in life.

.

Through a self-created project, students can best investigate their personal intersets by setting and managing their own goals while developing responsibility along the way.

When students can take it upon themselves to improve their education while on their summer break, they can find success and personal enrichment while still enjoying their vacation                                        ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever needed advice for a choice before? If you have and you have trouble making them on your own, that can affect your actions. If you don't know what to do go get some opinions from others. Getting multiple perspectives from others helps you because you will get more opinions on what to do and what not to do.

First, knowing that you have more then one person to talk to and get their opinion, can make you more likely to go ask more people for them. If people have had similar problems to you, where other people have those problems. Get both opinions on this problem, the more opinions you get the more options you have on your choice. It can also turn into you helping someone if you go to them and you guys work together to fix this problem on both ends.

Next, talking to multiple people could lead to different emotions on this topic and help you understand how you could feel. You could have a strong feeling about your opinion but you always need to think about what you're going to say. The more you talk about this to others, the more you will hear yourself and your perspective might change. If your perspective changes this could cause you to do something different that can lead to you having a better choice and decision.

Lastly, if you get only one opinion that could have a negative impact on you, leading to you making the wrong choice which can't be undone. In past experience I have had to make some choices, many of them i'm not to proud with. Most of the time I went to get one persons opinion because I didn't have much faith or trust in others. That ended up badly because they gave me their opinion and I didnt have any other opinions to base her's off of, so the choice I made ended up being a mistake.

In conclusion, having many peoples opinions to make a better choice and not mess up is better than just getting one opinion. You need to think hard about whose/what opinion you're gonna take. As stated in the essay, one opinion could have a bad influence, your emotions about it can vary and having people to talk to will make you go talk to more people. How will having multiple opinions help you with your choices?",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I think that seeking multiple opinions is the best choice for someone to make their own decision. They will have more opinions to be influenced by, they could have advantages and disadvantages about thinking of other people's opinions, and they could get more opinions from trusted adults who could have the same similarities.

First of all, someone who seeks multiple opinions will have more options to be influenced by, so that they can think about their own decisions. Seeking multiple opinions will help them decide which opinions they would prefer to help them pick from. This person could have a number of options to decide from so that they will get more ideas for the advice they could recieve. Asking for advice from one person is not a very good way for getting opinions, because that person will not have as many options as a great deal of people could have. The person getting advice should not decide on one person to get opinion from because they might not get as many ideas as they would like to get. Having more opinions to influence from can make up a huge decision for a person that is seeking more to options.

Second of all, they could think of the advantages and disadvantages of other people's opinions. They might not think that a lot of people have the best opinions for them but they can figure out which options they can pick out of a whole bunch. When they ask people for advice, they could get a number of good or bad reasons that they must choose from so that they can decide which ones they approve of the most. It might be hard for someone to figure out which options they should pick from unless you can pick a few opinions from each person and mix them up. One decision can contain different methods or opinions from someone and they do not have to be all the same thing. This person is able to decide whichever opinion they choose from even if there may be many consistent and inconsistent choices.

Third, getting more opinions from the people you trust can affect the similarities and differences you have between eachother. Different people will have different ideas and options from their perspectives on different kinds of things. It is best to decide whether or not they have the same opinions or ideas, to see if they could bond to make new decisions. Everyone that that person picks from to get advice, could have the same opinions as others or different. Depending on people you trust may have better opinions then those of the people you do not trust. This person might think that the people they do care about or know more, have more ideas to pick from and approve from because they know and trust them most.

In conclusion, I think that seeking multiple opinions is the best choice for someone to make their own decision. Asking for advice from multiple people is the best option because you get more opinions to choose from different kinds of people. Seeking multiple opinions can help the person see what other people think of which decision is best for them.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Driverless cars should not be aloud. The roads are already unsafe, it could harm other people and It would be very costly to afford a driverless car. If we invented driverless cars it would become a problem. ""In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.""

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that all students in school should take part in community service to help out their city, state, maybe even world. Students should at least have one day a week of community service. Many people may think that community service is hard work and kids our age shouldn't be doing this, they should be in school learning for a better education. But if they all help in community service it may help them a long the road to keep a cleaner environment, and have a good say about your self for good jobs.

The more help you get cleaning the environment now, the less you have to later on in your life. The students may think it would be fun and a good idea. They think it would be getting them out of school but really they are still learning. you may think.. How are they still learning if they are cleaning and out of school? But really they are learning about the true and real life. Not about your educations and school related, but how they are going to react and perform on people littering and keeping a clean environment. Sometimes the real life may help you in the school related life. You never know...

Helping with community service may come in handy for making new friends. They may or may not get to work with the people that have the same opinion as they do about helping keep a clean and wealthy environment, but that is life. They may come across people that love the environment, but you also will see the people who could care less about it. It would show them that this is the time to pick and choose their friends that will help me on the things in their life later on. They may not like choosing your friends, they might want to be friends with everybody and not care about how the environment ends up, that they will have their friends and they will help them when the time comes. All I'm trying to address her is that we need a clean environment and having kids from all different schools help with community service may be a great way to get in cleaner faster.

"Dear principal,

I don't think it's fair that you can't participate in a sport unless you have a B average. One reason why a student may have a C average is because it's in a subject they struggle with. Personally, I'm not very good with science. The past few years I've been getting C's, and I would have been devastated if i couldn't play the sport I wanted.

Another reason why a student may have a C average is because of stress at home. Many children, kids, and teens stress at home because of a death in the family, a divorce between parents, or may be their parents are just plain jerks. I feel I am lucky to say none of these go on in my home.

I do understand some reasoning for why you want students to have a B average to play sports. Some students try to depend on sports for getting them jobs or into colleges, so they decide to slack off in subjects.

Although I still believe a B average is too high. A C seems to be much more in the middle of grading. A's and B's are the spectacular grades, and D's and F's are the not so spectacular grades, and a C is just in the center.

In the end i do realize you make the decision of the grade needed, but I would be pleased if you would just take my words into consideration.

"Most people disagreee on the idea of taking away cars or creating fuel effeicent cars. One idea that can possibly top all those is a limited car usage society. Natiosn worldwide have vbegun starting a new trend/ orsmartplanning which limits cars usage due to the ecomony ,pollution it creates.

To begin with, limiting cars is becoming a new fad, people in  VAUBAN,Germany(Dorchland) say  it saves alot of time and money. Now you can just have your house in the suburbs and just stick to foot traffic youdont have to worry about car insurance or garages or keeping drive ways clean. No more dirty streets clean and motor sound free walking. With this new smart planning going on its harder for people to take there kids around and get to work. What goes along with this effect it saves people more money.

Lastly, Limiting usage of cars is going to help better the enviorment. Recently paris was under an enforced ban due to to a cloud of smog pollution. The use of cars releases toxi and bad gases into the atomosphere destroying are enviorment and causing effects on the polar ice caps. The limit use of cars cuts traffic down and time. another effect use we could use is a car free day were we could take buses , bicycles , and even skateboards. one major thing we should replace with our cars is public transports.

Inconclusion

Limiting cars usage is helpful and becoming more popular globally it can help the economy and also help slow down pollution.                                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.

The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.

Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.

The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Imangine being able to know the emotions of students during class, such as when they are bored, or when they are confused. Thats what the new Facial Action Coding System would achive. This kind of technology in the classrooms would be a nessestiy for teacher to effectivy teach to thier students, and idetify when they need help, or when they are getting bored during thier lesson.

Studnets get bored during class, and dont pay attention becuase of that. Students also get confused during class, but sometimes a bored student can get confused with a student that is confused on what the teacher is taling about and needs help. The FACS would change that, becuase teacher would be able to analyze whether their students are either board or confused, or enjoying their lessons.. It would also help teacher identify which lessons thier students are enjoying, and would be able to use that data to plan which lessons to include, and which lessons or activitys to throw away becuae they are boring and would not do the theire students any good.""'A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Haung predicts 'Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""' (D'Alto). Meaning that the FACS can help with digital lessons too, improving the effectinsy of them as well. Another asepct fo the FACS, is that it can help students learn more about identifying emotions. ""To and expert, faces dont lie; theses muscles clues are somtimes used tospot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isnt't being truthful"" (D'Alto).

"Dear Principal,

I think that requiring all students to do community service is a good idea. Litter has become a big issue in most schools. It would give students something else to do in their spare time. Also it would help people that volunteer to do community service, they would have less work to do. Instead of thinking of community service as a punishment think of it as being fun because you would do the community service of your choice.

There are many fun community service activities. For example there is tutoring children, cleaning up litter, volunteering at animal shelters, and many more. Tutoring children is fun community service because it gives you a sense of responsibility, you are teaching a child something to help them in life. Cleaning up litter is fun too. You can help clean up beaches or lakes and other places, so it looks better and the wildlife that live in the area won't be harmed by the trash. Volunteering at animal shelters is really fun as well. You care for injured animals, groom them, exercise them, and feed them. All of these sound really fun to me.

If you let the students pick their community service activity they're more likely they will do it without forcing them to. If they feel it takes time away from other things they're doing encourage them to find community service activities they would enjoy. Community service can be fun if you see it that way. It only becomes a negative experience if you don't enjoy it and if it doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment. Keep in mind that it not only helps the community, it helps themselves too by teaching them responsibility.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Image you were having different emotions going through your body all at one time but you dont want anybody to know that you are feeling this way. Well there is a machine called the Facial Action Coding System it can detect different emotions that go through out a humans body.

The machine called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in a classroom because if a student is having all these different emotions going through their body and they dont know what to do about it, the machine could really help them with the problem. For example if a student is having the emotions of being happy, sad, angry, or even disgusted about something the machine could really help let someone know that the student is having these emotions going through their body. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it states ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. This states the machine would know the emotions of humans and even paintings of someones face.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System it valuble for students in a classroom because the machine can send someone a signal about the student that is going through different emotions.                              ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Phones & Driving

Cell phones and driving is not a good combination. See when you're driving you have to pay attention because your life and others depend on it. Therefore, having a cellphone would make that task difficult because it is a distraction. Using your cellphone while driving diverts your attention from the road, causes you to be distracted in three different ways, and causes fatalities for you and others on the road.

One main thing that comes with driving is that you have to pay attention to the road and the people around you. You have to stay aware and alert to not only what you are doing but to what others are doing as well so you can correctly respond safely. However, if you pick up the cellphone for any reason makes it hard for you to do that if you divert your eyes from the road to your cell phone screen. Picking up that cell phone is not worth the disaster you could potentially cause.

Next, using your cell phone while driving distracts you in three different ways: manual, cognitive, and visual. The cell phone distracts you manually when reaching for it to respond to that text message you got or to answer that phone call you're receiving; causing you to take on or more hands off the steering wheel. You're distracted cognitively when your mind is off the road. Cell Phones cause this when you're engaging in the conversation on the phone whether it's via text or call. Lastly, using your cell phone distracts you visually when you check that text message or that notification; causing you to take your eyes off the road. All of this are only three reasons why using your phone while driving is one of the most dangerous activities to participate in while driving.

Furthermore, using your cellphone while driving causes many fatalities. The National Safety Council states that 1.6 million crashes are caused by the driver using their cellphone while driving. Statistics show that crashes caused by cellphones are six times more likely to happen than crashes caused by a drunk driver. In addition one out of four traffic crashes are spurred out of cellphone usage and each day 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving. All could've been prevented if they didn't pick up the phone.

Due to reasons stated above, when you are in your vehicle driving on the road please refrain from picking up your cellular device. There are many ways you can stop yourself from getting distracted by your cell phone. All cellphones have a mute button which you can use every time you step in your car. There are some phones that have a do not disturb button that silences all notifications that are not emergencies. All this you could do to save the life of yourself and someone else.

"Online school really sounds great, but is it really. Many people believe that taking classes from home is beneficial, but I think otherwise. Some may argue that you can get better rest and not have as much stress whihc are good things, but overall I think it is not a good idea. Most kids in school learn much better face to face with a teacher and not online. I have taken one class online for spanish in middle school to help me lern more and preform at the best of my ability, but I found myself losin focus. One of the biggest parts of school is the physical interaction with other people and online classes can not provide that for you. Classes at home would take away the social part of school, distract students from learning, and doesn't give you the chance to play sports at your High School.

Being social is one of the most important parts of school and society in general. Everyday I am excited to go to school to talk to my friends or even meet new friends. Taking classes from you room would completely diminish social interaction with kids. My latin class had none of my friends in it with me, which forced me to talk to new people and make friends. I became friends with people I wouldn't think of talking to our getting to know better. One of my sisters friends from middle school was home schooled up until the 8th grade. She seemed very different than all of the other kids in which she wasn't very social and didn't talk much. This is an example of how having classes at home can completely change a kids life for the worse. I went to a very small school from elementary school to the end of middle schooland knew every single person that went there. Making the switch to Generic_School was one of the biggest things I've ever had to do. From a class of 40 students to a class of 500 and going from 8 classes a day to 4 classes rotating off every day was a huge change for me. Making new friends took awhile, but all of these things helped me adapt and learn a lot about how I had to change and apply myself differently.

If I had to do online school I would barely get any work done. All of the distractions at my house would take me away from my work and not allow me to get anything done. At school there are very few distractions. We talk to eachother and go on our phones, but still we learn and pay attention in class. At home I would wake up late every morning, play video games, and have no motivation at all to get any work done online. Teachers watch over their students while they are taking test so they can't cheat on them, while at home every single student would be getting 100% on every assignment because nobody can stop them from cheating. That would stop everyone from learning the information because there is no need to study when the answers are sittting right infront of you. A girl who used to play on my team was homeschooled and would barely talk to use about anything. When we asked her about home schooling she said would get great grades on everything since it was online and she could just find the answers infront of her. Nobody understood since we were young and weren't homeschooled.

Playing sports at Generic_School is one of my favorite things to do. Trying out for soccer and making the team has given me the chance to become a better player and meet some of my best friends. If I were to be at home taking classes I wouldn't have the chance to even meet them or get better. Sophmore year I was terrified to tryout because I didn't know anyone on the team. From my perspective I thought I wasn't good enough for the team and they didn't need me. After I made the team I felt very welcomed to the squad by everyone and shortly became great friends with all of them. Taking classes takes all of these priviledges away from kids. Sports at school help you bond and gain teamwork skills that online school can't offer you. Online school can't teach you about being social or having teamwork and that is what I think school is all about.

Online classes would ruin my school experience by allowing kids to cheat and not learn the material, taking about sports, and not being able to socialize and make friends in your classes. The great thing about school is that you never know what friends will be in your class, or if you are going to have to make new friends. High School always prepares you for he real world without you even knowing. I have learned how to interact with adults and other students while being polite and using manners. With online school you wouldn't get the opportunities that school provides you. Online school may have its benefits, but I believe the weaknesses outweigh them.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever done something you didn't want to do because your parents made you do it? This makes you annoyed at your parents because they just ignored what you wanted to do. It is bad enough that your parents make you do the activity, but what if your principal made you do it. This is why I disagree with our principal making us do extracurricular activities. It is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.

It is our life not the principals. If we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. Principals job is to be in charge when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. Life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. We are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. We should get to decide our own path not the principal.

Most kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. They might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. Extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.

Kids don't always have time. Some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. They need their families help to fight through these tough times. If they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. If the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. Everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.

I disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. I don't think forcing people to do them is the answer to every bodies problems. Extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. It should be up to the family what is done not our principal.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Some people may not like the fact of limiting car usage, but there are many advantages to this. Limiting car usage could help in many different ways.

Having a car is very tense you always have to worry about things but when you dont have a car its much easier on you. In Vauban 70 percent of people dont own cars, and 57 percent chose to sell their car to move there. Not having a car is more convient if everything is right around the corner. In Source 1 it states, ""stores are just a walk away and not on highways"". Also, "" In previous bills, 80 percent of appropiations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"".

The Over populated use of cars causes pollution also. Source 3 states ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, campared to a 53.3 percent average of Diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters"". Some people abuse the use of cars and dont think about what it affects. With the limiting of car usage Source 3 Explains ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

People should really take car usage limiting seriously because it could help them out in a major way. So the next time you go to crank up your car just take this into consideration.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Driverless cars are a newer technology that has greatly advanced in the twenty first centuary, but they are a long way away form seeing them on the road. It is evident driverless cars have a negative impact on society through safety harzards, lack of legal laws, and unreliable technology.

It is guaranteed driverless cars will be a safety threat to everyone on the road becasue they can not be trusted. Driverless cars would rely only on the car itslef to get you somewhere, and people who no longer have to drive themselves. In doing this people are no longer able to be held responsible for any crashes caused by these vehicles, because they would not be in controll of their own car. It is known that crashes would be much more likely, and this too means more death would occur. Many people will become turned away from driving on the road if they know others are not in controll of their own vehichle.

In todays society there are very few laws put in place about driverless cars, which would create many conflicts if these car were to exist on the roads. It is said in article about the intentions of traffic laws that ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This means it will be very difficult for new laws to be passed which support driverless cars since a human would not be in controll of it. New laws would need to be put into place because it is evident when it comes to accidents with driverless cars people would need to be aware of whose fault it is.

Technology will always have issues where it fails to do its intention, and this is why we can not trust it with our lives. The human brain has the ability to think in a much different way than a machine would becasue they are just robots. If these machines which run off technology were more effictive than the human brain then everyone woudl have robots doing daily activites for them. As you can tell this does not occur in our socity today, because they are unrelliable. When driving a car you have to think and predict what could possibly happen. With the human brain we have this ability, but the technology driving the car has the ability to suddenly break and then the person in the vehicle would have there life potientally harmed. It will always be more reliable if you trust human knowledge over technology.

The safety hazards, lack of legal laws, and unreliable technology are all ways driverless cars will have a negative impact on the roads. Driveless cars may seem appealing becuase of the convience of everyone have a personal taxi driver (the car itself), but the negative impact outweights the prositive impact. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Schools are offering the opportunity for students to be able to attend classes from home via online video conferencing. Will student's benefit from this? The answer is yes! Online lessons are far easier for individuals to attend then physical classes. Students can simply log onto a device and attend their classes within a few minutes. Students also won't have to worry about any missed work or getting up really early in the morning in order to attend school. Let's say a student isn't able to physically attend class for whatever reason it may be. With this opportunity, that student will be able to attend class from home, and they won't miss any vital information. Online classes, also offer students with far more chances to turn in any work. They won't have to struggle in order to turn in any work, because with just one click, all their work can be turned in. Coming to a conclusion, students can and will benefit if schools were to offer online classes from home.

The argument between students being allowed to attend online classes has been a huge subject for the longest. Parents seem to think its a great choice, and it will help out students a lot. Schools offering students the ability to attend classes online is an amazing opportunity, and here's why. Allowing students the chance attend classes via video conference ensures that students won't be missing any important lessons. They'll be able to access whatever they need to complete their work. When that student goes back to physical school, they'll be updated on everything, and won't fall behind the rest of the class. To end this off, the option for students to attend classes from home is a good idea, because it's easier for them to attend classes, and they won't miss any important information.

With students being able to attend classes online, it's less stressful for them to complete and turn in work on time. A study was done at

Generic_School , in Generic_City, Japan, in January of 2018. The school lets students attend classes online, but only if they attend school physically at least two times a week. The study showed that over 85% of the schools population turn in their work on time when they attend online classes. That's almost half of the school. Another study done at the same school, shows around 82% of students complete work quicker when they attend online classes. This just proves that the option to attend school online is a great choice, and will benefit students. Coming to a close, attending classes online is extremely helpful for students when it comes to turning in and completing work on time.

Some parents argue that allowing students to attend online classes is a bad idea. This is because students can take advantage of this opportunity in various ways. They can stop attending physical classes, and stop turning in work on time. These students feel as though since they can simply log onto a device and attend class, they don't have to physically come to school and learn. Consequently, these students are the same ones getting in trouble, and failing their classes. They won't be successful, if they don't turn in work, or attend school.

In conclusion, schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home is very beneficial for students. Students are able to turn in work on time, and complete work quicker. Also, individuals won't miss any important information when they aren't able to physically attend class. This is good because, students wont be far behind the rest of their class when they eventually come back to school. Do you think students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?",0,persuade_corpus,3
"My opinion on driverless cars is that they should not be legalized. My reasoning behind that is i dont want something else taking over my car when i dont know that its one hundred percent safe. You can be severley hurt if one thing goes bad with the operation because its such a major invention.

In paragraph nine it talks about how in some states its illegal like California,Nevada,Florida, and the District of Columbia. It aslo talks about the technology failing it says ""if technology fails and someone is injuried, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? One other detail would be that in paragraph eight they say that ""why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver""? and it says next that ""wouldnt drivers get bored waiting on their turn to drive. In paragraph seven one more conflict is that the human driver has to always be on point because certain problems can occur with the creation and thats not good at all. All in all its simply not a safe thing to create or already have because its not completely safe. In paragraph three it says the one thing that makes alot of since they talk about cost they say that ""the smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, somethat was just too expensive. If you come to a roadwork situation or driveways or compicated traffic issues you have to immediately take over or the worse will happen.

In conclusion this creation is not safe for the public there are to many problems that can occur at any time that are life threatning especially considering your on the road and your around others that can possibly be injuried along with you. If they want this project to succeded they need to fix all the bugs with this creation because i just dont agree with the situation.                   ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Imagine that your going through a tough time and you want some advice .Who would you go to and ask for help? ,Would you go to more than one person ?Getting more than one opinion can help you make a better choice because you can get more than one perspective of the situation and you could compare and contrast your opinions with others and make a better choice.

When I was going through a tough time when my mom told me we were moving I was very sad,because just the thought of me leaving my friends again made me sad I didnt want to leave. I've felt this way before ,because growing up we moved a lot so i was kind of used to it but this time I made very close friends who I didnt want to leave .After talking to my dad about it he told me I could move in with him,my step mom ,and my half sister. I thought about moving in with my dad and thought how it could be a great opportunity to have some disaplince in my life. I also talked about it with my mom and she said that it would be a great opportunity to make new friends and open up a bit She also said that I would see my god mother and god brothers more often who which I care about very much. I also talked about it with some close friends and they told me that I should stay and move in with my dad ,because they know that I would miss them too much and that it would be a great opportunity to get more emotionally closer with him and that I could go vast my mom and other half sister on her days off just like i would do with my dad.

"I belive that these summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed. Students are able to work better if they get to design what their project should be about and have the chance to be more creative, they are also less likey to be stressed about doing it wrong. If these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing.

When students get the chance to design and pick what they can learn about for their project, they will most likely pick something that they are pasionate about. Which means that they will most likey have more information about it and have the opportunity to be more creative on the finished product. For example, if a student wanted to to bulid a model about something they like, then they will work as hard as they can to complete it to the best of their abilities. It doesn't matter what topic they choose, all that matters is that they are using their time wisley and learing about something new or learning more about something they already knew.

Having to do a project over the summer in general is stressful enough, so having a teacher get to design the kind of project students should do, would add even more stress. This stress could lead to students wanting to give up on the project and not complete it. Students are excited about summer because it means they won't have the stress of doing work for school, so if you design something that is easy and know a lot about, causes youto get it done quicker and enjoy the rest of your summer worry free.

In my opinion, I think that is would be less stressful if I could get the chance to design my own project. I wouldn't have to worry about holding up to what a teacher expects me to do and only worry about what I know i can do.

Concequently, if these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing. It limits their creativity and their work ethic. For instance, if student wanted to create a type of art work about what they learned about, they wouldn't be able to do that if a teacher got to choose the kind of design the student had to do. Students are expected to do their best and succeed, limiting them to do a specific project would only casue them to do the opposite. Students are capable of doing great things if you let them.

In conclusion, students should have the opportunity to design their own project. Letting students design their own projects would only effect them in a positve way. It would cause them to do their very best and improve their creativity. They would be less stressed about doing what a teacher expects and get the project done much quicker. Students would have more time to enjoy their summer worry free. Teacher designed projects would only limit them to what they are actually capable of doing. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In our world, many school are now requiring students to complete their summer projects so they could assure them to continue learning during their break. However, now they having a troubling tie deciding if school projects should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. The two controversy bias options have been growing in demand deciding which one would further help students with their academics. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and be able to continue learning about.

School projects should be considered to be student designed because students will be able to choose their own project that should appeal to them. If students don't get to choose and project they want, how will they even be motivated to learn about it? Students should able to find a project that is considered enough for them to work on, so they could be motivated enough to study. This then, help the students to learn more about their project and also help them conduct their own experiment with them, and finally this can help them to present their work showing what they have done. For example; if say a person chooses to a mini volcano project, he would first have to find out how to make it, then he have to study about how it works, and finally how will he summarize it on what id does or how an eruptions occurs. This can give a great start on what they choose to do or plans to do.

Next, school projects should be student-designed because students will be able to share and present their projects in class. This can help benefit both the students and teachers because the students are showing knowledge about their project, while teachers administer them to see what they have learned about. In the end, this will let teachers and school that student-designed projects are much more beneficial than teacher- designed projects. This can soon increase the chance's of choosing school-designed projects over the next couple decades. Leaning towards the future, many students will continue this and succeed in their academic or future jobs.

Students projects should be teacher designed to many students because teachers can choose project's they choose for their class and teachers can decide how tough they should be. However, if the teachers do decide to do this, the students will then not be able to understand what to do, they will not be able to do the project, and they can be very relectutant enough to do the project. Instead, what the schools' can do is let the projects be student-designed so, students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and be able to continue learning about. From this, many students would work on their projects, be motivated and end up work as hard as they can to do well in their academics. This will soon give a bright future towards all the students and a time for all the teachers to relax.

In conclusion, schools should decide school projects should be student-designed because students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and for them to be able to continue learning about. Towards the end, this bring's up students grades, achieve their dream goals, and help them and their school for choosing the right choice of what they have to do for the students school projects. This will then do a better job of taking care of the students and helping them retain their knowledge over break in a better manner than teacher-designed projects. In the other hand students than can support each other in taking in these projects and move further on working as groups or working in a competitive way, seeing who will get the better made. In the end, towards everything this new decision should be able to help everyone world widely.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In this essay I am going to talk about NASA discussing the Face with, someone who thinks it was created by aliens and I am suppose to convince that is wasn't a alien who, made the Face. Why don't I believe that wasn't a alien because it could have been a rock that landed and it shaped the Mars into a face in 2001.

So why I don't think aliens made it beacuse aliens aren't real, and they would have did something different probably if they were real. In this essay I don't think it was by aliens because it says "" The caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nise, and a mouth.

I don't think aliens made this because of the pictures and things. They would have showed up and given us a sign that they were there and there are satellites up that takes pictures of all the things and planets.

For my conclusion I think aliens did not make the Face because of many reasons and because, of the technology today we could have picked up a signal or something because, of the satellites and all of the technology we have today.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"We've all felt the stress of having to choose our subject and design for a summer project, the fear of not picking something ""good enough"" but what if the teacher just picked it for you. Many people agree that teachers should pick for the students, others say they should choose for themselves. Well, summer project designs should be chosen by the teacher because it causes less stress for the students and helps the teacher grade students on an equal playing field.

When students pick their own project design the teacher is going to have to grade each project by a different rubric everytime, which puts different pressures on each student. As a bonus, grading the projects takes less of the teachers time and effort so they can focus more on student effort, instead of building a whole new rubric for every project. This, in turn, will make students feel better knowing that they have an equal shot compared to their classmates.

It also makes students feel better by taking pressure off them to design an entire project from the ground up. This lessens the stress put on students to pick subjects and designs that might be too hard for them. Some students might choose a design that excedes thier capabilities and they would get a bad grade, but the teacher won't ask the student to do work beyond their capabilities. The main goal is to keep students from hurting their grades and mental health.

Some say that a student designed project would help the student because it caters to their intrests and needs. This way of thinking actually hurts students by putting excess stress on those who are less creative and providing creative students an unfair advantage. Also, it's said that students work better when they're intrested about the subject but this leads to the fact that some students need unwavering structure to complete big assignments. Certain students can't handle being given the freedom to design their own summer projects.

Stressing most students out just to saiciate those that want to design their own projects is, frankly, unfair. Teachers know what's best for their students and can help them if they get stuck on something because giving students free reign isn't in their best intrest. The reason teachers pick designs for summer projects is because they know better than to stress students out and give some students advantages over others.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Schools sometimes offer distant learning to students. Distant learning will allow students to attend classes at home by doing online school. Distant learning can benefit the students, because there will be no distractions. Students may feel ore comfortable being at home, and distant learning can also help students live up to their full potential. Having no distractions can benefit the students and help them focus.

To begin, distant learning can benefit the students because there will be no distractions. A classroom can be very distracting. There are a lot of noises going on such as talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing, and banging. All of those noises can draw attention away from the things the students need to be focused on. Another reason are fire drills. Students could be in the middle of a quiz or a test and the fire alarm could go off. The alarm will cause a disruption and disturb the class. Which will cause the students to be distracted and unfocused. Also, students may feel more comfortable being at home than in a classroom with a bunch of people.

Secondly, distant learning can benefit the students, because the students may feel more comfortable at home. Classrooms, and school in general, are filled with a lot of people. Being around so many people could cause anxiety. Some students may feel uncomfortable because there are so many people around them. Having so many people around someone with anxiety could make them feel nervous. When people are nervous their mind is either blank or their mind is just all over the place. Also, distant learning can help students live up to their potential.

Third of all, distant learning can benefit the students, because it will help them live up to their potential. Some students may understand a topic and some of the other students may not, but those students that do not understand the lesson might either be too shy or too scared to say anything. Those same students too shy or scared might not say anything or ask a question in fear that the students that do get the lesson might make fun of them. Other students probably do not even care about their work they just want to be the class clown. With online school their will be no class to entertain and that will cause them to focus on their work. Also, sometimes being in a classroom with other people can help students.

On the other hand, being in a classroom can help benefit the students as well. When students are in a classroom they are able to bounce ideas off of each other and some students and even teachers can inspire other students to do better and set higher goals for themselves. Being in a classroom can also help people with their communication skills and can also help students crawl out of their shell. Also, doing online school could cause students to miss out on all of the fun school experience. However, distant learning has more benefits for students.

In conclusion, some schools offer distant learning. They do this because they think it is beneficial for the students. Distant learning will allow students to attend classes at home by doing online school. Distant learning can be beneficial for students, because there will be no distractions, students may feel more comfortable at home, and students may also live up to their full potential.           ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Exploring Venus would be very hard, but would be worth the risk.

Venus one of the closest planets to Earth.

It is about the same size and density as the Earth.

Venus has a chalenging atmospher, but that wont stop people from trying to go there.

Venus is worth pursuing despite the danger it presents because it could tell humans more about the Earth, human cerosity will drive people there eventualy, and people know little about what is below the dence atmosphere.

Venus could give us as humans a greater understanding of Earth.

Venus is Earth's sisster planet.

This means that Venus is about the same density and size as Earth.

The author also states that Venus could have been coverd in water and supported some form of life.

Although travling to the sister planet would be hard with its dence atmospher and its scorching heat.

Humans will eventualy find a way to travle to Venus.

In the text the author states, ""Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevors.""

This means that humans should not be limited by our doubts and dangers but humans should insted expand to meet the the cornerstone of innocation and creativity.

People know little about what is going on beneth the carbon dioxide blackets of Venus's atmosphere.

All endevors to go to the sister planet have faild.

"Projects are not always something that students dread, in the summer it may be a different story, summer usually the time for most students to finally be free but some classes require a project before the next school year. I can agree with that since it helps retain information from the previous school year. When I though of if those projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed I thought of all the possibilities. When thinking in terms of high school, I believe that summer projects should be student designed to build skills in project management, to be more independent, and to learn more about subjects on their own.

Scout organizations often have awards or ranks that require members to go through their own projects from start to finish. Eagle scouts in Scouts of America, previously known as Boy Scouts of America but still abbreviated to BSA, emphasizes the use of project management in doing their projects. Some scouts do most of their projects in the summer or during breaks because they have time. Scouts have guidelines to follow about the process and the use of the project but what the project is left to his or her interpretation. In Girl Scouts you can not duplicate projects which gives more variety in projects made. Some of these projects are not always physical like building greenhouses or building bridges but can be raising awareness. Taking these projects on requires a lot of planning either to contact governments or specific departments to build things in town or contacting the school to do a seminar at the school. They also need to plan to see how much they are spending, who they need to bring to volunteer to help them, and making advertisements to help bring awareness to their project. All of those things strengthen the skill of project management.

Most highly known award like Eagle scout for Scouts of America or the lesser known Gold Award for Girl Scouts require scouts to work from start to finish on their own. Of course, there is application to submit to their respective council to approve their project and there is guidelines to what the project may be but it's left to his or her's interpretation to make a project themselves. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed which I interpret as the teacher creates every portion of it; not just the guidelines, but what the students should do for the project like building a model, writing an essay, making a video, or making a collage. They man believe that students many not have the imagination or go so off topic that it is no longer about the subject. However, I have seen amazing things done without much input from a teacher or a leader for a project. A lot of kids can come up with awe-inspiring projects without strict guidelines and build their project at their own pace. They have to have their own initiative to research, plan, and execute their project. They have to ask permission to build on property on their own, they have to ask to do their drive their school on their own. There is no one else to help them and it helps build the skill that is needed for independence after high school.

In school some classes do end-of-year projects that are due, and presented, before the end of the school year and student pick a subject in their unit to research more on; what I did was researched on Norse mythology in my history class, my freshman year. We needed to create a poster and another visual representation of what we researched. In this case I did a doll repaint to make her look like of the Norse goddesses, I researched about the different gods and goddesses in Norse mythology. I learned about something I was interested in which gave me more of an understanding to the history tied to it. The more I learned about it the more I remembered which shows that projects that are student lead help them learn more about the subjects they learned that year and help retain the information for later years.

Student-designed projects help engineer a more independent generation. It will help them with skills they need to bring to their adult lives. They learn how to manage their time and the materials they work with. The learn the ways to be independent and take initiative to get things done. It will benefit their ability to retain information for subjects they study more into. This all shows that student designed projects in the summer will befit them more than teacher-designed projects because of how many skills it works on. For this to benefit all students, I for any summer assignment made to be student lead so it would help enforce a better school year. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Having your own car can be great, but it's hurting the earth. So much pollution comes from cars, about fifty percent of the greenhouse gases in America are from cars. Cities have put bans on driving causing people to find our ways to get to work, cities like Vauban, and all of the driving causes pollution.

In Pairs, France, there was so much pollution and smog in the air, people with even number plates coiuldn't drive one day, and odd numbered plates the next, it was like this for five days. In Bogota, Colobmbia, there's one day every year where cars are banned, taxis and public buses arre still permitted though.

Vauban's streets are completely car-free other than the downtown area where the tram runs. 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move their.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""

, said Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban.

As mentioned, about fifty percent of the greenhouse gases in America are from cars. Only about 12 percent in Europe. France is one of the most polluted countries in Europe because of it's tax on gasoline, that is not on diesel fuel. Diesels make up 67 percent of France compared to the 53.3 percent average of the rest of Western Europe. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to London's 79.7!

"In the article,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks despite many dangers that Venus has and what Venus is capable of doing, the author thinks it is a worthy persuit. I will give evidence on why I think the author gives good support on his idea.

For example.""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.(P4)"" I used this example because it explains how Venus was probably covered with water and most likely supported forms of life and finding out that there was once or still is another form of life on another planet and how there was once an ocean or still is an ocean is fascinting for discovery and a worthy persuit. Another example,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.(P8)"" I used this example because it tells how if we strive hard enough to face and cope with the challanges presented to us by Venus, has a reward which is value like research and inisight of the planet.

In conclusion, I used these examples and explanations above because it shows how the author supports his idea on why persuing the exploration and study of Venus is worthy and could have value to our knowledge.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal:

I am writing on behalf of the kids at our school and the effect of changing the school policy would be on them. Many kids are at a C average in their grades, and can participate in sports. If the policy is changed to a minimal B average requirement, then many students will not be able to participate in sports or other activities. The school policy should not be changed because it would be a lot harder for kids to compete in after school activities, a less amount of students would be representing the school, and there wouldn't be as much control without the influence of extracurricular activities.

Education does come before extracurricular activities. Kids represent the schools in numerous academic ways, including the core subjects. The amount of work given to students is already discouraging and many do not do their best on it, but find they do great in the extracurricular activities. Schools are represented more by kids who are in sports or are in other activities.

Changing the school policy would make it harder for kids to be in sports and other activities. Many kids already find that school is challenging and therefore do not put their best effort into their schoolwork as they do to other activities. We cannot change that fact and it would be silly to punish other kids who get a C average, but that is the best that they can do. Sports and other activities are crucial to the development of the future adults of America.

Changing the school policy would make it so less students represent the schools in other ways besides academics. All kids are not science or mathematical geniuses. They are just regular, average kids who find joy in the extracurricular activities that the school has to offer. A student may not be great in one thing, but may be amazing at another. Why would we want to hurt the development of the students who may find a future career in something other than academics.

If the school policy was changed, then there would be less control and order in the schools. Many kids come from bad homes, and the extra activities offered at school allow them to feel like they fit in and that they can succeed in whatever they do. We are building the future youth of America and changing the school policy would change the future. The extra activities are helpful to stimulate the young minds and keep them out of trouble.

The school policy should not be changed because it would be a lot harder for kids to compete in after school activities, a less amount of students would representing the school, and their wouldn't be as much control without the influence of extracurricular activities. School is a vital place in helping to develop the minds of the youth, but also to help them grow and succeed. Many kids rely on school and raising the policy to a B average would discourage many students. Lets keep the policy the same and continue to help the future leaders of this great country.

Thank you,

"Lately, there has been a debate on whether or not students should be required to participate in community service. I believe that students should be required to participate in community service. Community service is something important that students should do to help improve their character.

Community service is important because it helps build character. For example, when a student with low self esteem participates in community service by helping others in need, it helps that student build confidence. Also, if students get in trouble a lot, they can be punished by cleaning up garbage around parks and freeways. This task doesn't seem very fun, so the student will learn from their mistake.

I will admit that community service does take up a lot of time, work, and effort. Some students might not have the time to do it. Other students might be handicapped and not have the physical ability to participate in community service. It takes a lot of work to put down the video games or the remote and get off the couch to go and participate in community service.

However, community service doesn't have a set schedule. You can do community service any time you want and as your schedule provides it. For example, if you have to do community service three hours a week, instead of doing all three hours in one day, you can do an hour a day, three days a week. Also, if you are handicapped, you can always do community service by tutoring younger kids and starting programs to get other students involved. To add on, if your feeling lazy and don't feel like participating in community service, then just think about how your about to help improve your community to help get you ready for it.

In conclusion, I believe students should be required to participate in community service. It helps build character and your improving your community and the place you live.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-desdigned or students-designed?

These summer projects should be student-designed for varies reasons such as, engagment, vaction, and lastly, confidence.

Students during the summer have many things to worry about like having a job, looking after siblings or even their mental health and the last thing on their mind is a techer-designed project. The projects given throughout the summer should be student-designed becuase it allows the student to be engaged. The student will be more engaged because it is a topic that they want to learn about and being engaged shows that the student is willing to learn and is very intrested in his or her own topic. Typically, when a teacher assigns a project to a student, the student isn't very pleased and with that being said, it could affect the amount of effort and the desire that the students puts into actually learning.

Secondly, these projects also need to be student-designed because of summer experiences. During the summer, alot of students grow. Vaction plays a big role in the students growth and development, as the students travel they pick up more and more knowledge, which expands their knowldege and could possibly change thier perception of things, making it easier for them to have better ideas and to do well on their summer projects.

Lastly, student-designed projects over break leads to confidence. Because the student has had the freedom of choosing what he or she wants to learn about, it just makes it easier for the students to showcase their work with pride. Pride meaning, showing that the student has learned and is more than comfortable to enlighten others. To have confidence about what you have put alot of time into and worked on is an important skill to develop because the student will surely use it some other time in their lifetime.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed because it will surely keep the student engaged in his or her own learning and add a little more excitement to the students vacation because the project is something they are eager to learn and work on. Lastly student-designed projects will help build the students confidence because they know what they are talking about.                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Requiring students to complete a project over summer break should be teacher designed. By the project being teacher designed, a student can expect the full growth and general knowledge they are capable of. If students designed the project, only a little bit of work would be accomplished. Therefor, the project should be teacher designed, it would challenge the students, give them a earlier start to the next grade level, and improve all of their students academic fields of learning.

Teacher designed projects would challenge the students more. If students were to design the project themselves, some students would make it meaningless and easier to accomplish, so they can enjoy their break. So, teachers should design the projects, it would make it challenging, and give the student the ability to actually learn and complete the assignment, rather, it being easy and meaningless. The more the brain is challenged, the more knowledge it is capable of learning. The more a student learns, the more of a head start you will have on the next grade level.

By the project being teacher designed, you can have a head start, or a earlier advantage to the next grade level. Student designed projects would be based off of last years academics, which means they will have no advantage for next year. Teachers know what students need for next year, so the project should be designed by the teachers, will allow students to be successful. It will help by enhancing the students growth in all aspects of academics.

Teachers will make the project challenge all of the students academic fields. Students would only study and want to learn things they already know and are familiar with. A teacher can broaden the field and make it diverse. One day you could study math another science. Therefor, the student will grow in all academic fields.

Teachers should design the summer projects. Students would accomplish more, start a great track to the next school year. The student would be more prepared for next year, they will be challenged, and grow and flex in all aced mic fields of learning. So, go to a teacher, a principal, or go to your local school board office, and bring this issue up and make a change.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a picture that looked like the resemblence of a human face. NASA showed the picture to the public and it definitely drew attention to Mars. Some conspiracy theorists believe that the Face Viking 1 found is evidence of life on Mars, but NASA later came out and said that the face was actually just a landform, a mesa. I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, a clearer picture confirms this, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and NASA wouldn't hide that life was found on Mars becuase it would benefit them.

The Face was not created by aliens, becuase a clearer picture taken in 2001 shows it's just a landform. In the article it states, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" NASA used their best equipment to make sure they would be accurate when discovering what the Face really was. Also, in the article it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Sometimes when you see something at first it looks like something odd, but when you take a closer look it turns out to be something ordinary; that's what happened in this situation.

Another reason, why the Face wasn't created by aliens, is becuase it's just like any other landform. In the article it states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" Like I said previously, the Face turned out to be a landform, and the landform itself isn't something specatacular, it's just an ordinary landform. It is something that is common, that just formed like the mountains and plateaus in North America today.

Finally, a formation created by aliens would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide that. If it was made by aliens and there really was life on Mars, wouldn't NASA be excited and telling the public about it, since it would promote their company? The answer is yes, they would, which is why I believe they are telling the truth that it is just a butte or mesa. The article states, ""Some poeple think that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars."" This proves my point that NASA would be be thrilled and want to tell everyone about life on Mars, if there really was.

In conclusion, I think the Face found on Mars was just simply a natural landform. There is more evidence that proves this than there is that proves it was made by aliens. Taking a closer look at it you can clearly tell it is just a landfrom, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and proof of life on Mars would benefit NASA, so they wouldn't hide that information. This shows why I believe the Face found on Mars is just a landform, and was not created by aliens.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i do not agree with you about having at least a B average to play a sport.

I believe that students should at least have a C average because the sports they have keep them healthy and fit.

If you made it the way you want it, the students could end up obese or their grades might drop.

If they are to have at least a C average, they are still getting good grades and doing their homework.

Students rely on their sports to stay healthy and even though their grade are not a B average, but they are still trying and getting the work done.

I am going to be in three different types of sports in one year, cheering, color guard and volley ball. So as you see i also rely on sports but not only because they keep me fit and healthy but because i enjoy doing them.

Students all around the world are in different sports and even thought they might not have the best grades, you know that they are having fun and they enjoy doing what they do; But if you take their sports away, what are they suppose to do on their free time?

There might even be a lot more fighting and arguments because of all the free time on their hands.

If they already do their studying in a regular basis, are they suppose to just sit on the couch, eat food and watch television? Here that's what we call being lazy.

Students should have fun and its good for them to socialize.

If they are in sports, that could be a possible scholarship, even if they have a C average. You can see there progress in their school work if you let do their sports. A healthy body equals a healthy mind.

You shouldn't pressure students into doing their work and getting good grade because those students' grades can begin to decline and they might even transfer school to do what they love, I would.

Students need that endurance and a lot of strength to go through the rest of their life. So please listen to me, keep it at a C average and let students work up to a B average.

They would really appreciate that.

Like I said, students need and love their sports.

Sincerely,

"The face that you see on mars was not something created by aliens. Although it may look like a face its not. What you see in this picture is a butte or a mesa. In the following paragraphs I will state reasons helping you undertstand that the pictures effect everything and that it wasnt created by aliens.

The pictures that you have seen are very old. Most of the pictures you have seen where taken from 1976-2001. These pictures have really bad graphics. Things that are old are usaually harder to understand and comperhend. Its hard to see old things clear. Advances in technology have helped us see older things a lot more clear. We can fully understand things from the past now.

The cameras we use today have a lot better grapics. Back then their images could only span 43 meters per pixel. Today our cameras can span 1.56 meters per pixel which is a lot better. This helps us see pictures a lot more clear. We took pictures of the of the face and could see certain things the older cameras couldn't see.

In the new pictures if there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids we would easily see them. There wasn't any of these things. What the picture of the face showed was equivalent to a butte or mesa. It looked like landforms found in the American West. It reminds people of the

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

All the new pictures we have help us undertstand and see things more clear. We now know that it wasn't created by aliens. Its just a simple butte or mesa thats no very special besides the fact that it kind of looks like a face. It reminds people of a Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This face has nothing to do with aliens.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"People use them to commute around various locations and it releases harmful emmissions. The object that is being reffered to is a car, a car is beneficial but people should limit car usage because it cuts down on pollution of the atmosphere and it is not as bad as it seems to not use a car all the time, and limiting usage of cars is starting to trend.

Cars release green house gas emissions that affect the ozone layer of the atmosphere. that is a main cause as to why people shoul limit car usage. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[the smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" as explained in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog . This shows that smog is caused a good amount by cars and has affected major cities around the world. it also showed that when less usage of cars happened there was a 60 percent decrease in congestion which is a big percentile. in paragraph 5 of the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

it is explaining that automobiles are a big part of the suburbs and is a affect on the efforts to try in cut down on green house emissions of cars. its states in the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, that ""passanger cars are responsible for 12 percemt of green house emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Some may argue that the percent of green house emissions produced by cars is not high, but in reality it is and the numbers keep rising. If people limit the use of automobiles the numbers can be cut down and reduce pollution in areas that have heavy amounts of smog, smog affects the health of people and is toxic. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as atated in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog this shows that driving is a major contributor to smog and can be reduced by people limiting the usage of cars.

limiting car usage is not so bad and can even promote a happier lifestyle as shown in the articles about limiting driving. ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way,'' said a media tyrainer and a mother of two whos statement is said in the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows even when the people of the community of Vauban, Germany, experince a fortuitous life style. '' Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a move,ent called ""smart planning"" as stated in the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

this shows that limiting car usage is a ""trend"" and it leads to a positive outcome that affects generations to come. People around the world are also taking up the movement of limiting car usage, in Bogotoa, Columbia a buisness man named Carlos Arturo said ''it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" as referred to in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota thsi shows that not only the advantages of limiting car usage is decrease in air pollution but can also benifiet the individual. 'If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment."" as explained in the article

The End Of Car Culture.

this is relatin to the pattern of how in America the buying of cars is going down since 2005. which as result of that ocurring has benifited or will benifiet the enviroment. This shows how more and more peole are traveling less by car.

The advantages of limiting car use far outway the disadvantages of not using a car. this means that people are duing more to commute less by car and more by eco friendly transportation like bikes. The limiting of car usage not only impact people now but will do so in the future of the world and if not changed will result in the mass pollution of the globe.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Most schools require students to complete summer projects. Over the years, there has been a debate if these programs should be student-taught or teacher- taught. Summer projects should be teacher- designed because, teachers have a greater knowledge of the subject, are trained to keep kids engaged, and know how to plan a lesson that students can relate to worldly.

Teachers all around the world study the subject(s) that they teach. This gives them greater knowledge than any student would have. Most teachers are required to graduate college, and get a teaching degree as well, (some teachers even get their masters). That is more years of studying a single subject than any high school student may have. Studying this single subject for many years, gives them a lot of experience, and specific knowledge to help educate a student on the subject. Although students can always learn the material, they may not have as great of knowledge as a teacher on one specific subject. Teachers have at least four years of knowledge that a students don't and thats why they're better teachers than a student.

Along with four years of college, teachers must receive a teaching degree. While studying for this degree, teachers learn how to plan out lessons, and keep kids engaged. A teacher would better keep kids engaged, because they are trained to keep kids focused, and keep them involved in the material they learn in class. Weather this is; keeping kids involved in class by doing a project that is hands on, or having them start conversation to create development of their skills and knowledge. Some may argue that students would keep kids more engaged, due to how they can relate to kids their own age, teachers can relate to students too. Teachers know what its like to goo through schooling, because they had to do it too. Teachers are trained to keep students entertained, and develop their skills inside and out of the classroom.

Most teachers enjoy learning about their subject they teach daily, this keeps their material relevant and reputable. Making sure that the teachers material is relevant, helps kids from around the world be able to relate to the lessons. Mr. Generic_Name, is a second grade teacher at Generic_School. Over the summers he likes to practice his teaching, by traveling the world to see if his material is still relevant in other countries. Many teachers will do this to ensure that what theyre teaching their class is resignating with each student. Keeping teachers' content relevant is a sure way to keep kids relating to the topic.

Summer rprojects should be relatable, engaging, and well taught. That's why Teachers should teach Summer Projects. They've had years of experince, teachers can relate to kids, keep them engaged, and create lessons that relate to the world. Teachers are the best fit to direct summer projects. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Online school sounds very foreign to most people, but is very beneficial to students. It offers many things that a traditional brick and mortar school cannot. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students' learning would be unaffected by weather or other conditions, students would have an alternative to their brick and mortar school, and students would have more flexibility and independence.

Schools often close because of extreme weather, such as snow days. Although snow days are usually celebrated by students as a reprieve from the burdens of school, multiple snow days can interrupt a student's learning and lead him or her to struggle later on. After missing days of school, teachers can feel rushed to get through their material, so they spend less time on parts of a lesson, leaving students with gaps in their learning. If school is canceled for a long period of time, students can forget what they had learned and lose their focus. Coupled with the rushed teaching at school, students can significantly fall behind in school. This can lead to a drop in the student's self esteem, since they feel they cannot understand the material. In my experience, whenever school was canceled for a long period of time, this was the pattern. In an online school setting, classes would not be canceled because of weather or other conditions, so the teacher would not have to rush, students would not lose their focus, and students' self esteem would not drop.

School attendance is mandatory for most children in the United States, but sometimes there are problems with the schools that students have to attend. Schools can be understaffed, underfunded, have bullying problems, or a toxic environment. Forcing children to attend these schools can only hinder their learning. If the students were allowed to attend classes from home, they would flourish in their learning. An online teacher can teach many more students than a traditional teacher. With video conferencing, every student would be able to see the lesson clearly, and with email, the teacher and students can communicate effectively. Funding would not have as great of an impact in an online school setting since most of the resources would be online, which is less expensive than in a traditional classroom, where the school has to buy many materials. In online school, any type of cyberbullying can be easily seen by the teacher, as opposed to traditional school, where teachers cannot monitor the actions of all of their students.

Allowing students to attend classes from home would give them more flexibility and independence. Students would be able to manage their own schedule, which builds time management skills, and learn to contact their teachers online in a professional manner. Students who pursue extracurriculars, like sports, would be able participate in their activities, and study uninterrupted at a time most convenient for them. Instead of having to wake up early after staying up late and be groggy for a large part of the school day, a student would have the option to sleep in and be rested and ready to learn for the day's lesson. Students would also be able to spend more time on a part of a lesson that they struggled on before moving onto the next part. Having uninterrupted learning time, being well-rested during the school day, and spending more time on a challenging part of a lesson benefits the student's learning.

All of these factors support that claim that students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students' learning would be unaffected by weather or other conditions, students would have an alternative to their brick and mortar school, and students would have more flexibility and independence. Having online school as an option would greatly benefit students in many ways. It benefits some students more than traditional school.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I think extracurricular activities can be very beneficial to some kids. There is so much you can learn. When participating in an extracurricular, you can really enjoy yourself and have fun, get to experience new experiences, and they can help you get something thats stressing you off your mind.

You can have so much fun being involved in an extracurricular activity. There are so many different choices to choose from. You can choose things such as sports, arts, or just something fun for a class with a teacher. They are all fun options and you can do all of them if you would like or if you have time. It can also help you meet new friends with the same interests. Maybe there's a girl or boy that you didn't think you had anything in common with but now y'all participate in the same extracurricular. They have many different benefits. If you stay after for things like sports then that can help you become more active or if you stay after for arts, then you can learn many different things like taking pictures or playing with clay.

Extracurricular activities can help you get out of your comfort zone. Maybe you might make new friends or even a new friend group. There are so many different possibilities. Sometimes people worry too much about school and don't have time for fun things. I think that the activities will help. It's okay to give yourself some free time. Many people don't get to try new stuff. Some people get scared to play a sport because they think people will judge them. People shouldn't be able to control what you want to do. Even if your not good at that sport then just play it for fun. Don't play competitively but play for yourself. And if people don't think that you can do it, prove them wrong. If you don't think you can do something then try it out to see because sometimes we doubt ourselves. I think people should be able to do whatever they want and get to try new things because sometimes you find something you really like.

I also think that they can be very good because they may help you stop stressing about something that has been on your mind. If you do a sport, then you will be way too busy exercising to even think about anything else. When your being active nothing else should be going on in your head other than the sport you're playing. If you do arts, then you're gonna have way too much time having fun and not worry about what else is going on in the world. In art you want to have tons of focus to make something pretty. You don't want to just rush and make something bad or ugly. If you do something that your really enjoying, then I don't think you will be able to stress about anything that's happening in your life. It really takes your mind off stuff and many people, including students with tons of stress, need that. It's good to take some ""me"" time once in a while and do an activity that you will enjoy.

I think every student should do one extracurricular activity after school. Sometimes students have too much work going on at school and another activity is not what they want but maybe it's what they need. If you keep stressing that you have too much more than you have no motivation to actually do it. Maybe an extracurricular that you really enjoy can be that motivation. Extracurricular activities have many different benefits for many different people. Students and teachers can really benefit from them. Extracurricular activities should be something that everyone can enjoy.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"An Electoral College is a process established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifed citizens. Each candidate running for President has a group of electors who people vote for when voting for the candidate of their choice. The candidate with the most electoral votes and popular votes is the new President. Although this is not a democratic process, we the people still need to keep it for various reason including, having swing states, the votes between bigger states and smaller states, and avoiding run-off elections.

Toss-up states, or swing states, mainly help the outcome of the election. Although they don't elect who becomes President, they are the ones who are more likely to really listen to the competing candidates and know who to vote for than careless voters who vote for no obvious reason or are told to. They are the most thoughtful voters, which could really help the U.S. pick a great President for the next 4 to even 8 years. The more votes from those who pay attention to the election, the better chance of having a great President.

Bigger states are important to the candidates in the election. A larger population would mean more votes, and more votes would avoid a tie between the candidates. For example, Florida is a larger state. In 2012, the popular vote was very close because Florida had more electoral votes. Wyoming, a smaller state, had only 3 electoral votes. In other words, larger states get more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states do.

The Electoral College avoids run-off elections, which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When there's a tie in votes, great pressure arises and the presidential election process is greatly complicated. The Electoral College avoids this problem, reduces the pressure and produces a clear winner.

The Electoral College may not be a democratic process and may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carring their state, but is important in a variety of ways; including swing states, votes between big and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote that may decide an election.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I believe that students should not have the privilege to use cell phones at school because if the students were able to have there cell phones at free periods they would become to much of a distraction for the students to be able to concentrate, and they would just have that urge to check there phone or they would even check there cell phone for that matter. And that is not fair to the student because he or she should have an equal amount of education. It also wouldn't be fair to the students in the surrounding area or the teacher who has spent he or she's time making the lesson plans.

I believe students should not have cell phones out at all is because cell phones are also a way drama can very easily get started , because you can just start texting and rumors can get spread faster.

I am writing this letter regarding your policy on cell phones during school hours. In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students. As school goes on, the curriculum becomes more difficult which encourages students to study harder and focus more on getting higher grades. While their grades are very important, this may create stress on some students which may even lead them to get lower grades.

Permitting the use of students' cell phones during school could possibly reduce the stress they have from being the studious children that they are. Having less stress and pressure on them may result in higher marks and eventually an exemplary school. This could benefit the school district greatly and this policy can be spread to other schools so that all of our campuses can be exemplary.

Another reason why this cell phone policy could result in a positive outcome for our school is it could maybe even save lives. For example, if there is a fatal emergency in the cafeteria that involves choking, a student could simply dial 911 to get an ambulance there as soon as possible.

There may be some issues when first putting the policy in order, but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class. To prevent cell phone usage during class, students should be allowed to go to their lockers after lunch to put them away while under the supervision of an administrator. This keeps them from cheating on tests, contacting anyone outside school, and being distracted in class.

I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. I am hoping for your kind consideration.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear State Senator,

We all know that the presidental election process is very important to our nation.  Many believe that using Electoral College is not a democratic pedigree, and that using the popular vote method is better.  I believe that we you keep the Electoral College in electing our nation's president.  There's a less likely chance that there will be a dispute, and we'll avoid run-off elections, with Electoral College.  During a presidental election, it is possible to have a dispute over who should be our next president.  The Electoral College helps reduce that issue.

In addition, the Electoral College voting method is better than voting by popular vote.  With Electoral College, we're less likely to have a dispute.  A lot think that a dispute over an Electoral College could not happen.  According to ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", a dispute is possible.  A dispute happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College rarely exceeds his share of the popular vote.  The third source gave an example of the Obama and Romney election.  Obama recieved 61.7 percent and Romney recieved 51.3 percent of the electoral vote.  Making a certain outcome of the election, and not resulting in a dispute.  Also, with Electoral College we avoid a run-off election.

To continue, the electoral college avoids a ruin-off election.  It avoids the problem where no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  The third source stated above, gave an example using the Nixon and Clinton election.  They both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.  When no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, it complicates the presidental election.  The Electoral College reduces any complication involving that.

Although the Electoral College is the method in which we select our president, it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.  Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California, have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign, knowing their vote would have no effect.  But, no voter's vote swings a national election.  Which means about one-half of the Americans eligible to vote, did not.  People that vote are people who want to express their political preference, rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  The Electoral College method is the choice to pick.

I believe that the Electoral College is the method we should continue using when electing our nation's president.  We're less likely to have a dispute, and we would avoid a run-off election, with the Electoral College.  This method has been working and should continue to work for our nation.

"Dear principal

I think we should have cell phones for that if we forget a number and you need it you can get it. Because of the fact that we forget parents number to is a reason for having a cell phone.

That is best for us students. we need cell phones to help us not forget numbers. instead of caring a sheet of paper. you can just get your phone out and go to the contacts.

we should be able to use them when in gym,lunch,and outside. And that teachers keep there phones out and can text call or anything like that we need the same thing.

i understand that some students will get careless and just text and class. that is when it need to be taken up. because you are in class to learn not to text. but we don't learn nothing in lunch or outside. but we learn in health but not in gym playing basketball all the time.

all you do in our gym class is do your exercise and then play basketball or football.

i know it help you learn these sport but that just a class to text or call in. you should not text or talk in a library. because a library is a place of quiet and noise from your cell phone is not tolerated. why you are walking it is not good because you bump into people who might get mad at you. you should not be able to text during crct because you may run out of time and fail the test.

because without the crct you will have to retake and then if you fail you are retained.

All I'm trying to say is that students should be able to use cell phones only in places where is not learning nothing. you know what to do let us use only in none learning places.

"Distance learning is becoming very popular in my generation. You can easily sign up for an online classes, or classes instead of having to actually go to school to learn. There can be many reasons for a student to do this, some students may not work well in the school environment, some students may have certain jobs so online school helps them to create thier own schedule, or maybe there is even a deadly viras going around and they have to put students in online school so they can get work dont from home. Taking online school can be very beneficial to students that desire to do so.

Some students out there don't enjoy the public school environment. Sometimes it is the teacher, the students around them, or maybe they are struggling with a disorder or a diseas. This is where online school can come in hand. Doing online school gives the student a safe place they can go where all they have to do is sit in their bed, open their computer and they are at school. You don't have to worry about the stress of not liking your teacher, or even how you are being treated. From personal expierence a handful of teachers that we have in our public schools today forget that they were like us once and had no idea what a certain topic was about, and probably even struggled with it. They often get frustrated with us when we don't catch on as quickly. Or they just try to get through lessons rather than teaching them. But with onlice school you are able to go at your own pace without having any trouble or distractions around you. Something that other students can also struggle with is bullying. For some, school is not an enjoyable safe place for them where they can freely learn without being bothered. Which of course is not ok by any means and if a student is stuggling with this they should tell an adult. But, there are cases where the student wants to be taken out of that environments, so that's where online learning comes in so they don't have to deal with the stress of everyone else and they can focus on their education. Now, there are also students that struggle with diseases and disorders. There are certain illneses that can cause you to be in the hospital for long periods of time, so you can't go to school, or school is not a safe place for you to be because of all the germs and crowded hallways. You can bring your computer anywhere and get all of your work done, which can take someones mind off of things and make them feel like they are working at something and to keep going. Online school is a safe place for students to learn and get their education without having to worry about anything else.

There are students that have to become the parent of the household sometimes, because they need more money, or they have an absent parent. This can put a lot of pressure on a kid my age. We don't really think too much about paying bills, or having to buy groceries, or worring about when our next pay check will come in. But, there are students out there that have to worry about that. They work two or three jobs to support thier family, which leaves little to no time for school. Online schooling gives you more free time because you are able to make your own schedule. You don't have to worry about waking up on time, then going straight to your job after school, then having to go home super late and get all of your work done. You can take your computer anywhere you want, at any time you want, and sit down and get your work done. This can take loads of stress off of a student that shouldn't be stressed out about things that we normally would relate to our parents stressing about, but at times some people get put in certain cercumstances.

Now, something that is going on right now is the Corona virus. This virus is spreading all around the world and killing many. So one place where most of us students get sick from is school. There are hundreds and sometimes thousands of students touching so many surfaces in our schools each day. These surfaces aren't getting disinfected every second of the day so this is why so many kids end up getting sick from school. In my area there have been 2 reported cases of the corona virus. Schools are now talking about closing the schools and putting us all into online classes since it will be a substantial time out of the classroom. Putting us in these online classes keeps us all caught up on our work from home. None of us will have to worry about catching this deadly diseas, and it keeps the teachers safe too. So doing the online classes is going to benefit us because we won't fall behind and have a huge load of work to do, and it takes stress off of teachers so they don't have to worry about having to teach us tons of lessons in a short amount of time.

So in conclusion having these online classes can really benefit all kinds of students in many ways. You go to class on your own time, from the comfort of your own home or wherever you may choose to do you work. Being a good student is something we all strive for, and none of us want any unwanted distractions. There is no need to worry about anything else around you. You are able to get your education, and succeed in an easy and comfortable way.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Cell phones are good things to have I believe the first policy is the best. I say this because cell phones are good, when an emergency happen to or somebody else. This is a true story that I am about to tell so I must warn you that it may get a little gruesome. When I was in the sixth grade my best friend an I were about to graduate and since it was close to the end of the year, and we had no work to do, and it was the beginning of summer. My best friend RELATIVE_NAME and I were racing to get to the concrete court outside but when we were racing RELATIVE_NAME ran into to somebody which made him trip RELATIVE_NAME and when RELATIVE_NAME

tripped he fell on his arm i was still running an then i heard a loud yell coming from the top of some bodies lungs. It was terrace, as I looked back RELATIVE_NAME was on the ground an blood was spilling from his arm and it looked deformed. It looked like a T that had been cut right down the middle. i ran back to him, I didn't know what to do, my mind had went blank of every thing, the only thing i knew was that RELATIVE_NAME was screaming right in front of me. I didn't have a cell phone to call for help. so I ran all the way back to the building but the door was locked so i went the long way eventually i made my way back to a teacher an a ambulance had got to the school and was able to help terrene but after that i was thankful. but if i were able to have a cell phone i would have been able to help terrene by calling the police. or by calling someone that could help. so that is why every time somebody ask me if we should have cell phones or not i say we should.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principle,

I have heard about how you are deciding on banning cell phones, or allowing them at school. I hope you will consider to allow them at school during free time, such as before and after school. We students have many important uses for cell phones, such as calling our parents, calling friends incase of a problem at school, or to dial nine-one-one when needed.

If there was a problem where we needed to be picked up because it is raining and we do not have an umbrella, we would not be able to if we did not have our cell phones. Another example would be if a friend or classmate needed a ride home. And when parents pick up their children, their is always a long line at the front of the school, so they call them to let them know they will be parked by the curb two blocks down the street.

Another reason is if they need to call their friends for homework, such as when a science project is due. They can also call them to let them know that they left a belonging at their house, or if they have a question only their friend can answer. If they had a argument in school, and want to talk about it, wouldn't they want to call their friends? Well they would need their cell phone in order to do that.

Let us say that a female student was walking home, when she happened to encounter a bully is abusing a child younger then him. She would not be able to do anything but tell an adult right away. But let us say it happened in a alley next to an abandoned store. The only choices for her would be to interfere, or call nine-one-one. The latter is a much better idea, considering that it is a lot safer, and she would not get hurt.

I hope I have convinced you of why cell phones should be allowed in school. It helps students keep in touch with parents and is a great backup in an emergency! If there was a problem where the students were to use their cell phones in class, it can be solved by telling the teachers to confiscate them until the end of the day. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter. I can not wait to hear you decision!

"Not driving cars sounds like a crazy idea; How will soccer moms get their kids to soccer practice; How will commuting executives get to their offices? Although driving a car is an easier way of getting around, the amount of pollution a car throws out into the atmosphere just isn't worth it. When people stop driving cars, they start to drastically reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that's being sent out through a car's tailpipes, reduces traffic congestion, and is satisfying a lot of people world wide.

Europe alone is responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, following the United States' 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, in some car-intensive areas. Paris, the capital of France that champions the use of diesel fuels typically has more smog than other European capitals, having 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Although the bans on cars may receive complaints for delivery companies, there are exceptions such as; Plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more people.

As a result of Paris's partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impounded. This partial ban led 60% decrease in traffic congestion. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of the capital city devoid of traffic jams. Rush-hour restrictions in Bogota have also dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have sprung up.

The reactions towards the idea of limiting car usage has been taken with great satisfaction and support. In the city of Bogota,Colombia, a city of 7 million people, millions of colombians participated in a car-free day by either skating,biking, or even hiking to work. Althought it rained, Mayor Antanas Mockus of Bogota explains, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"". Mayor Antanas's quote just shows what people are willing to do, rather than taking the easier, and lazier way of simply taking their cars to work; In a sense, it shows dedication to the event. Even a high-society man like Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man from Bogota describes this event as a, ""Good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". This idea; the idea of limiting the usage of cars can be excersized by any class of society, be it poor, middle class, upper class, even rich, can participate, anyone can participate.

In the end, the advantages of limiting car usage includes, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases, reducing traffic congestion, and satisfaction.                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The principle has decided that it would be a good idea to force students to participate in an extracurricular activity which the idea behind this plan in not bad, the plan is to get kids to spend less time inside on devices and out being social doing things but there are many holes in this plan. First the biggest reaon that this is a bad idea you are forcing students to do activitys which the school has no right to do. Another big reason this is a bad idea is the kids who already to things outside of school will just have less time in their day and it might even take away from the things they already did that the school is trying to encourage. What I don't know is how they are going to enforce this they can't change your grade so the only thing I can think of is detention. Finally there are not enough activities for everyone in the school not everyone would be in an after school activity they enjoy.

Schools have no right to make kids stay after for this reason even if it is not everyday I do things outside of school that are not considered extracurricular that I would not be able to do if I had to stay after and it would be that case for a lot of students. I don't think any student parent or teacher would agree with this plan again the idea behind it is good maybe if you rewarded kids who participate in activeities it could help but forcing them to is not the way to go. This plan assumes all kids are sitting at home on their phone or playing video games and this solution might work for theose individuals but for the ones who are not it would just be annoing to have to stay after and do something they don't like when they would usually be at the park playing basketball.

I know we have gone over why this is a bad idea but how would it work, how would they enforce this, the only way I can think of is detention because they can't make it effect your grades that would be to unfair. So in any scenario you would stay after school and at that point the principle should just add a hour to the day, we already spend most of our life that we are not sleeping at school. Finally there are not enough activities to go around maybe there would be enough for everyone in the school but not everyone would enjoy them. That would just be annoying to be forced to go to german club every Tuesday and Friday because the school said so and you take french and the only reason you are not in that club or any other is because everyone else already took up all the spaces in the clubs you wanted to join.

Maybe this new rule works differntly than I guessed it would and maybe it is a good idea but based off all the information I have this is a terrible idea and no student would be happy especially the parents, the parents would not be happy especially if they have a life where they don't get to see their kids often and the school system just cut their time in half because they have to stay after doing yoga. If you just look at it from the veiw of everystudent at the school there is no way you could still support this. Just let kids do what they want to do it is the parents responsibility anyway, just encourage them to do the right things with their day in a more positive way this is simply not the way to go.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In the artical the author decribes that Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) can help to identify human emotional expressions. Profeser Thomas works with another guy named profeser Nicu. Profeser Nicu was from the University of Ansterdam. I'm against the vaule of using computer techonology to read students emotions.

One example that the authour gives is where the process begins. The text states"" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D coumputer model of the face"". The FACS has classifies six basic emotions which are: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These emotions are associted with the movement of the facial muscles

"We should always ask for different peoples opinion on somethings so we all will have more than just one option. I know for me it is always easier to ask different people so I know what they think. This one time I had to make a big choice and I had no clue what to do. So I asked friends and they came up with great things that I had to think about. I chose one thing they said and it turned out great in the end. Asking different people for their opinion is good because I can see all of my options, so I can see witch one is a better option, and so I can see witch one is smarter.

First of all, I want to have different peoples opinions so I can see all of my options. It is good to have options so that we can choose the one we like the best. It is also good to have options so I have a chance to comprehend all of my options before making the final choice. The reason I need to know all of my option is so I do not have regrets. We should also always have the ability to make our own choice if we do not like the options that our friend gave us or if we feel like the options are not as good as our own.

Second of all, we should want different opinions so we can make the better choice. A reason for that is so I can see witch option seems nicer. I should always have options so I know exactly what I should do. I should always make the better choice so I do not live in regret. The reason we should not live in regret is because it is not a healthy thing to do and I would always be thinking about the ""what if"" and it is not worth it.

Third of all, I always want to make the smart choice. I always want to get all the best options so I can be smart and pick the smart choice. I always need to know the right choice from the wrong choice. I order to do that is I need to make a list of all the options and make out the wrong options so I can choose the right choice. To make the smart choice I need to stay positive threw out the whole thing. A reason for that is because if we are being positive then things will work out better but if we have negative thoughts then it might not work out as we thought.

In conclusion, asking different people for their opinion is good because I can see all of my options, so I can see witch one is a better option, and so I can see witch one is the smarter choice.

"Do you think summer school project be teacher-designed or student designed so student could stay learning over their breaks.

I think that summer schools project should be student-designed for better understanding.

Student-designed project will be much easier for student to understand, because they are the one that are going to do the project and will need to use their own ideas and mindset for project that they will understand. Student will have more ideas and better understanding of their projects.

Student-designed project will have more affect to student, they will learn more over breaks and have a developed mindset of creating projects on their own. They will have better understanding and ideas for making unique projects for what they have experienced. Student will more likely turn their projects in with confidence and see what the teacher thinks.

Most student won't turn in their project for two reasons they didn't understand what the teacher was asking for and or they wanted to create their own projects. By letting student-designed projects their will be a higher chance for student to turn them in. This will allow them to use their ideas and mind set run free and in the future they will have better understanding.

I think that the new policy on grades and sports is a great idea. Many students have a hard time at keeping their grades up while playing school activities.

To be good at sports I also think you should have good grades. To be able to get into a good college you must have good grades. So I think it is very important that kids keep B and A averages throughout grade school. If you are taking on the responsibility to play a school sport, you should be responsible to do all your school work and to try to get good grades. The new policy is a great way to keep kids focused on school.

"In Miami, sitting in traffic is simply a part of everyday life, be it during lunch hour or rush hour or be it because of unpredictable accidents or planned road closures. The city is so large that it is oftentimes impossible to walk from point A to point B in a timely manner, and the climate is so unpredictable that is is oftentimes impossible to make such a trek anyways. Could Miami ever be made a car-free community? Considering that these types of communities lower municipal carbon emissions, require better city planning, and encourage people to take advantage of public transportation, Miami, and other cities and suburbs around the United States, should make efforts to reduce private car ownership and use.

Car-free communities are not a theoretical concept. In fact, cities and smaller suburbs have made the move to car-free lifestyles and even been designed with limited car usage in mind all over the world, and even in some parts of the United States. Places like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia are using this trend to make citizens happier, healthier, and more efficient (Rosenthal, Selsky). Alternative transportation, be it walking, bicycling, or taking a bus, is just as viable a way to get around as cars are, and it leads to smarter city planning that accounts for a higher volume of pedestrians walking from their homes to run errands and go shopping and a lessened impact on the environment through fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These things also work together to make for happier citizens. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo about Bogota's city-wide car-free day, a program instituted by city officials to encourage limited car usage in 1999 (Selsky). A mother of two and media trainer in Vaudan, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, agrees with Mr. Arturo, saying that life with cars was ""always tense"" (Rosenthal).

It is very understandable that cars would make people nervous. ""Cars are responsible for ... up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal). Greenhouse gas is notoriously harmful for the environment because it speeds up the process of global warming which can result in higher mean temperatures and things like smog that can bring up very serious health risks. Record high levels of smog in Paris, France last year forced city officials to institute a temporary ban on driving while the city's air was allowed to clear (Duffer). Paris typically has a higher amount of pollution in the air than other more eco-conscious European cities, sometimes even a full 67.3 micrograms higher than the level of pollution in London according to Reuters, an international news agency (Duffer).

Car-free communities lower carbon emissions tremendously, making smog and other consequences of greenhouse gases much less pressing issues to deal with. In order to reduce the number of cars on the roads, public transportation must be readily accessible and as effictient as possible. This helps city governments manage the amount of carbon they are pumping into the atmosphere by giving them the opportunity to regulate things such as buses, subways, and other forms of metro transit. Public transportation does not only mean actual modes of transportation, though; car-free communities must make allowances for the creation and maintainment of things like better sidewalks and bicicyle paths for citizens who elect to use them (Rosenthal, Selsky). Congestion would then also be lowered because fewer cars on roadways usually do not result in city-typical, and definitely Miami-typical, traffic jams (Duffer).

While it is impossible to assume that Americans will stop using their cars from one day to the next, there are many ways to gradually increase the appeal of car-free lifestyles in commuter cities and suburbs and therefore to reap some of the benefits of diminished popular car usage. In fact, milennials in America have already started this move towards car-free communities (Rosenthal). Younger generations are waiting longer to apply for their licenses and buy cars, instead choosing to utilize public transportation, walk, or car-pool with friends. Sociologists have also noticed that America has surpassed peak car usage, meaning that Americans no longer drive as much as they once did. The ""car culture"" that prevails in suburbs and cities through the nation may be on its way into obscurity if the trend continues (Rosenthal). Scientists, sociologists, and citizens alike will most likely agree that this move will indubitably be one for the better!    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Driving a car has its ups and downs to life. It provides transportation, but it can also be very dangerous. Another issue with cars today is the amount of pollution that cars give off. Smog is caused by cars and is not good to the environment and certainly not good for people to be breathing in. Both ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" and ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" discuss the affects cars can have on the evironment. ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" and ""The End of Car Culture"" talk about the decrease of the amount of cars used today. Many communities today are turning into car-free places to clear up the smog and dangers of driving.

Smog in Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have reached record pollutions and both cities do not want to deal with it any longer. Robert Duffer writes about how the Paris government enforced a new rule which allowed both even and odd numbered license plates to drive on a certain day and would alternate everyday. This was very beneficial, however some people needed transportation but would be fined $31 if their car was used on the wrong day. Being that Paris is one of the most famous capitals of the world, one would expect to see more smog than usual. Andrew Selsky also writes that in Bogota, Columbia, a day without cars was put into place in the 1990's and still continues today. Once a year, buses and taxis are the only transportation allowed in the whole city. If not obeyed, there would be a $25 fine. This day was put into place as an improvement campaign which also benefitted the city. Bike paths and smooth sidewalks were put in and during rush hour has cut the traffic in half. It also opened up restaurants and shopping malls which were widely used by the public. Both Paris and Bogata saw improvements in their environments without having so many cars on the road.

Life without cars can also be beneficial to ones community because few people will be buying gas or diesel fuel for their cars. Elisabeth Rosenthal tells her audience that Vauban, Germany has an upscale community where nearly everyone has given up their cars. Here, people sold their cars just so that they could buy a house in peace without having to hear traffic jams and honking horns all the time. Many say that this environment makes them happier because it is so peaceful. 70% of the community do nott own cars and the ones that do must leave it in a large parking garage outside the developement  that is purchased with the home. In another article, also written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, discusses America and the recent  decrease of the amount of driven by a single person. Research shows that the amount driven in 1995 is about the same as the amount driven in 2013. This is due to environmental protectionists who walk evrywhere they go and due to the dangers of driving. There are fewer young adults driving today as well; in eight years, the amount has decreased 23%. Many are giving up their cars today to make a better, happier living.

There are cities all across the world that are limiting the amount of cars being used. Smog is a very pollutive that many don't even realize. Many say that walking and biking around provides them with a more peaceful lifestyle. Limiting car usage will provide less smog in the air and will save you money from having to buy gas or diesel fuel.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1

The cars have a self driving system and tell the driver to take the wheel when needed, but what if the driver has fallen asleep or has had something happen to them, they will not be able to take control of the car. Therefore, self driving cars are a bad idea for the world.

Driverless cars do not allow the world to be driverless. People will still have to drive the cars when something happens that the car can not handle. The article states, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" but what if that next mile something in the car goes wrong and the car crashes. Google explains how their cars are not completey driverless. The cars will alert the driver to take over when the car can not handle the sitution that they are in. So, what is the big difference between someone driving the cars full time or having a car that drives itself unless something happens?

There is no difference when it comes to picking the right choice. The driveless car is a fault and can not keep people safer on the roads. People could eaisly get unfocused and not pay attention to the warning sign that the car gives to take over. If the car tells the driver so many times to take over the driver could get use to the signal and not pay attention when the signal goes off. For these cars to work they way they have to work ""they [need] a whole lot of sensors."" What would happen of the builder of the car forgets to put a sensor in, or one of the sensors does not get programed the right way? Then when the car is driving something happens because a sensor was not placed or had a default. Then who will the blame be placed on? The driverless car or the actual driver who was told by a sign that they needed to take over, but the sign never came because a sensor was missing. The world would most likely believe that the driver was not paying attention and that it is their fault.

Now the car does have some really nice features, but can these features live up to the name? The cars have ""sensors [that] can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine,"" that is a nice feature but again what if the sensor quits working. The whole idea of a driverless car is a good idea until a person finds out that they must trust sensors to alert them when they need to take over. In the article it talks about how there could be a object of some sort that keeps the driver awake and alert incase they have to take over. What if the driver gets so into the object that is supposed to keep them alert that they do not feel or see the signal. Another thing that could go wrong is if the driver thinks that they will not have to drive the car they may turn around to take of kids in the back and not see the sensor or feel it. Then you have a bad crash that puts not only a single person in trouble but several people.

The whole idea of driverless cars is a good idea, but with good ideas there are things that can go wrong that people have to think about. A driverless car is a serious thing to think about before they get soild to the public. The people who create the cars need to be able to promsie that the cars are one-hundred percent safe to the public and that they are trust-worthy. The people who make the cars can not promise that one-hundred percent becuase they can only make the cars to their best and after it is the a dealer shop they can not take back what happens. These cars could make a lot more crashes happen and that could lead to a rise of death rates. These cars are not super trust-worthy, therefore, they should not be put out of the market for people to buy.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Does the Electoral College work?

The Electoral college is a process in which it happens. The Electoral collge is not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president. The Electors are people who vote for President and Vice President, and how many votes each one has gotten. The priotity in the Electoral College is that it consist of having 538 electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect for the new President. It has to have the same amount of entitled alloment of electors to the same amount in its Congressional.

''Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors''. But are state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are. We as Americans all get a new President every four years and its always held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you are voting for your presidenrt you're voting for your candidate's electors. But most staes just have a ''winner-take-all'' system that awards all electors to the new winning president candidate.

Most people may not like who are next president is gonna be but all just have to deal with it because we all cant go back and pick who we wont to be president. It all depends on how many votes a person gets. Some may get only one vote and others will get millions of vote it all depends on if they think your good enough to rule your your county. It is very hard for you to make a decsion that big.

After the presidentail election, your governor prepares a ''Certificate of Ascertainment'' listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidentail election.

the Indefensible Electoral college:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong

What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? That would be Abolishing the electoral college! AL Gore-thanks to the quiks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency. More than 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election. The electorak college still has its defenders.

If you are under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Sometimes stae conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidental canadidates themsleves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.

What if state send two slates of electors to congress? It has happened before in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily vice president Richard Nixon, was there but he made sure to do so ''without establishing a precedent.'' The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of people.

In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only just wright there. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen staes didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. It's finally done The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Its har dto say but mr. Dole was right all along.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"When you seek for different opinions do you ask multiple people? A study shows that when people ask multiple people for different opinions for a certain thing they make a better choice then not asking anyone for their opinions. This happens because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing, the certain individual that they are asking has been through that same situation, and you get multiple opinions and you pick the one you think its right.

Its better to ask multiple people for their opinion because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing. For example, lets say that a student was asking her friends if she should take a job or not and more than half said yes and the other people said no so, shes probably going to go with the answer with the most votes. Also, there is billions of people in the world and they have similar but not exact opinions on a certain thing or situation. It is also better to ask for different opinions because every single person in the whole wide world as a different mindset and different ways they will solve their problems and they also have different knowledge over a certain thing.

Many people ask multiple people for their opinion because that certain individual that they are asking has been through that same situation. It is sometimes very common for someone to has had or has the same problem or been through that situation. For example, my friend ask me for my opinion for a certain situation and turns out I had been through that same situation or problem. There for, I helped her solve her problem and helped her make a better choice. Also, when you find a individual or person that has or has been helping you solve that situation, they sometimes can help you through life because you and them might have a similar mindset of solving a problem or situation.

Seeking for multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you will get multiple opinions and you will pick the one you think its right. It is proven that when you have different options to pick from you will pick the one you like the best or the one you think it is right. For example, lets say that someone had the chance to pick anything from a box of expensive items, they will probably pick the one that is appealing to their eyes or the one that it is more visible to their eyes. There for, it is the same thing that happens when you ask multiple people for their advice for a certain thing because then you will pick the one you like the best.

In conclusion, people ask multiple people for their advice for a certain thing or situation because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing, the individual that they are asking has been through the same situation, and you will get multiple opinions and you will pick the one that you think its right.          ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Should Drivers Be Able to Use Cell Phones While Driving?

""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because it creates a distraction that could not only lead to injury to the person on their phone but also other innocent drivers on the road. Even the most experienced drivers can find themselves losing control of the wheel while concentrating on their phones. Also driving is a task that requires constant awareness, any type of diversion can lead to accidents no matter how quick it is. In a lot of cases death and serious injury is the result of ""glancing"" at your phone even for two seconds. In reality no text, call, video, etc is worth losing a life over.

Additionally the mortality rate behind using cellphones while driving has caused some states to take legal action. 19 states have banned hand-held cell phone usage while diving, 39 states bans any cell phone usage for novice drivers, 20 states bans any cell phone usage for school buses and 48 states have banned texting while driving. So not only is cell phone usage while driving dangerous but also illegal. So if you are using a cellphone you risk getting into an accident and getting into trouble with the law, which could possibly require jail time or a fine. Also this can affect your insurance, constant tickets and fines from texting while driving can make your insurance go up almost two times its original cost.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause car accidents. Studies show that using a cell phone can make you 4x more likely to crash. Despite the dangers, people still use their cell phones while driving to communicate or occupy themselves. Some may argue that using hands-free features is safe, but research shows it can be just as dangerous as holding the phone because the conversation can distract drivers from the road. Distracted drivers have a slower reaction time meaning in case of an emergency where they need to make a quick move they won't be able to. Having that quick extinct when you're not distracted could make the difference between life and death.

Although people may say ""It was just a one time thing, I barely text while driving."" Science begs a differ, during recent years it has been studied that texting while driving has become a huge epidemic. Scientist have even compared it to craving junk food, stating that like junk food we crave being on our phones. Study shows that the average person check their phone once every 12 minutes and 80 times a day. So using your phone while driving can definitely become a habit even if you just do it a ""couple times"".

In conclusion, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives. Putting up your cell phone and waiting until you're at a stable place can save your life. No one should put themselves or others at risk to reply to a text message. Even if you're hands-free it can still distract you on the road and make you unable to make detrimental last minute decisions.

Everyone should be mindful of everyone and themselves and focus only on driving when their on the road.                              ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Dear the principal,

I am so against the change you making for sports, not everybody can get a B grade average. That is completely unfair to students who gets a C grade average. I you need to take consideration on this before you do.

So just because a student has a C grade average they cant play sports, so know you are denying physical activates for your students. That's bad i don't think the board would want to here this.

Nope at all, i think the parents would get mad too just there child is trying to get a C grade average they cant play sports. What if you have all advance classes can the student still play. i two high school classes and let me tell you they are not the easiest classes in the world to pass with a B or higher.

I still don't like the idea but i understand what you are doing. If a student wants to play sports that bad they do there hardest to raise there grade up. That a good motivation thing to do to get the students up. If half 75% students are playing sports that means they are making good grades. but no every student is like that though you cant punish the students just because they don't make a B grade average.

Do not change the school policy because a lot students will not be able to play sports. A lot of students wont get the fitness they need every day.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The student don't need there emotion's expressed some like it hidden. It says we humans perform this same impressive calculation but why would we need to if we keep trying it maybe someone will get mad and not like it because why would someone want to know what there emotions are. Computers don't need to understand what humans feel because they don't have feelings. The computers are using emotions and the way we look at the computer to see if we know what we are doing if we don't the computer will make it easier on us so we will understand what is going on.

The main idea is about the science of emotions and not a lot of the people care about there emotions but sometimes it is important to learn about ur emotions even if we don't want to because sometimes we could use the work of why we use so much emotions when we talk to people or even taking the trash out we all still use emotions but why do we.

in conclusion the whole story is about the science of emotions it lets everyone know if we are mad or sad even angry and sometimes people help out with getting ur anger down but not all the time does ur anger go down sometimes it stays up because you won't let anyone help you. our emotions are hard to hide but sometimes it helps like when ur mad but don't want to show it but you also want to show it because you want the person to leave you alone or put down something that i already yours.

body: some people use a stress ball to calm down and not a lot of people use it because they think it is for babys but some people need it if they can't keep there anger in check everyone needs to keep there anger in check if not there anger will get the best of them and then they will be getting in a whole lot of trouble from letting there anger get the best of them the best way to make sure you don't get angry is just to find something you like to do and do it then just put headphones on so you can just mute them and can't hear anything if they mess with you then go somewhere they won't go.

"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author's main purpose is to suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author excells at backing up his claim by providing benefits of traveling to Venus, the dangers that it comes with, and how NASA has strived to make traveling there possible. The author does well at supporting his claim that traveling to Venus has value because scientists are aware of the dangers that are presented.

The author initially gives background information about the planet Venus and transitions to the factors of Venus that are dangerous. For example, the author says that Venus has ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" and ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid."" The author continues giving specific challenges by saying that Venus's temperatures ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience."" Lastly, the author explains the geology and weather dangers such as ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes."" The author provides these specific dangers in the article to show the readers that scientists are aware of the challenges they must deal with so that they are prepared.

Although the author presents these numerous challenges of Venus, the author does a fantastic job of immediately explaining why it is worthy to go there. For instance, the author explains that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author gives evidence of this claim by saying, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,"" and that is was ""covered largely with oceans...and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This evidence provides the readers with benefits of learning more about Venus. Furthermore, the author also explains that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it could ""be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" The author does execellent at supporting this idea and even gives evidence that this is not a fantasy.

The authors's claim of Venus being a worthy pursuit is realistic because the author provides ideas that NASA has developed to safely travel there. For example, the author gives evidence that NASA has worked on allowing ""scientists to float above the fray."" The author provides specifics of avoiding these risks saying, ""...the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" This evidence supports the author's claim that scientists have taken serious consideration to study Venus.

In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is the most similar planet to Earth, so they should learn more about it. The author also includes the numerous factors that are dangerous when visiting Venus. However, the author emphasizes that these challenges and doubts should not limit the strive to gain more insight on Venus.          ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Dear Principal,

I think that you should go with policy one because this policy will allow students to enjoy there free time and have more attention during class.

I think that the students will like that policy more and will respect you and other staff that enforce phone policy.

Me as a student do not use my phone during the day but the students that do end up getting in trouble by the teacher, they end up doing bad because they are not paying attention, and they become angry when the teacher takes their phone away.

I would very much appreciate you considering my proposal for you trying to use policy one over policy two.

A few other reasons why I conceive that you should use policy number one is because policy number two will not change at all when kids use their phones at school, this will just keep repeating the same policy on the students and the students will not like the fact that you considered letting them use their phones and then denied them that choice. The students will like their teachers and their authorities, like yourself, a lot more if you give them the choice to use their phones at school at non-educational breaks during the day like lunch and passing period.

Now you might have to warn them about getting to class late because they are using their phones, and if that happens too much than you should warn them and then move to policy two until they earn their intellectuality to show up to class on time.

Another good reason is it might be a opportunity that you may never get to take again or if you wanted to try it too see if you like it.

If you are 18 though you could be drafted for military service so if u ever wanted to be apart of the military service it would be a good idea to sign up. Another good reason is if you wanted to just go and look at some new places this would be a good idea because they travel a lot and make a lot of trips.

Going on trips like this to places that need help because they just got out of worl war ll can make you see how much more help thses people need then you do.

"Dear state senator,

I beleive that we should get rid of the electoral college. It is unfair to many voters. Because of the winner tak-all system in each state candidats dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focsing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not seee the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Caronlina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markes did not see a single campaign ad. we should also get rid of the electoral college because of the electoral college they lost 60 percent of the voters who would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidtate receives  majority of the votes casted. For example Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43percent purality of the popular votes, While winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 ecetoral votes, there is pressure for run-off when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

But back to electoral college votes being unfair a lot of the states like  wyoming north and south dakota knowing they only get three votes that count some people dont even bother voting, I mean I would not want to if i knew that my vote really was not going to make a diffrence.

so yes electoral college votes are good like how obama recived 61.7 percents of the votes out of the 51.3 percents that Romney got, because all states award the winner take-all system. But I think that we should go back to a direct election to make the voting fare to evryone to keep everyone voting and make them feel like we are still one country.         ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"Driverless cars: are they really safe? There are many points to go with the postitive and negative things about driverless cars. Both sides have very important points to make. There are, however, many more negatives than positives. Three negative points that will be discussed in this essay are: driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions and put many people in danger, and there is an increased risk of car crashes if driverless cars are used.

To begin, driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers. If a driverless car were to fail to do a task correctly, that mistake could result in an accident. This accident would then bring up the question, ""who is at fault?"" When this question surfaces, many drivers will blame the car manufacturing company, bringing up the point that the car itself failed and not the driver. When this point is brought up, many car manufacturing companies will have to fight lawsuits and have to appear in court. This court showing would result in a large conflict for the company and for the driver, seeing as many people outside of the issue would take sides. The issue would become a large problem for the world, and would be easily settled if driverless cars were not mad to begin with.

Also, driverless cars would increase the amount of car malfunctions that could happen on the road, resulting in an increased danger when going out on the roads. Driverless cars could malfunction in many ways. For example, they could fail to alert the driver when they need to take over, they could fail to communicate that something is wrong with the car itself, or they could fail to drive correctly. Each of those malfunctions could cause serious problems on the road, and put many people in even more danger than they are already in. Although there are many more malfunctions that could happen with a driverless car, they could all be prevented if driverless cars were not let out on to the streets.

The third point is that driverless cars increase the risk of car accidents. Car accidents happen in many ways. If a driver is distracted, if a car malfunctions, if there is a road block, etc. With driverless cars, many drivers will become more distracted, feeling as though they dop not need to watch the road at all and can do whatever they please. However, that is not the case. With a driverless car, people need to be on a higher alert than they would with a regular car: making sure the car does not malfunction, and keeping an eye out for the worst. If a driver were to become too distracted, they would not be watching the road closely enough, and are putting many lives in danger. If the car were to try and get the driver's attention for assistance through an area the car felt it could not drive through, the driver would be too distracted and the car could crash.

To conclude, there are multiple negative effects driverless cars would have if they were used. Driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions, resulting in many lives put in danger, and with driverless cars there is an increased risk of car crashes. Driverless cars are a bad idea, and should not be put on the roads. They put many people in danger. Driverless cars: are they really safe?    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Have you ever thought what it would be like to get behind the wheel and not have to drive? Well in this day and age that might be a very real possibility. Technology is getting more and more advanced these days and car companies are working on cars that drive themseleves. I believe that would be very cool to have a car that could drive on it's own for the most part at least. Google has made cars that are mostly driverless except when you have changing road conditions such as construction or an accident. These cars work pretty good too. It's been tested and has driven over a half a million miles accident free.

I think driverless cars could be very beneficial because say your out drinking or you can't drive for some reason this car could take you home instead of having to call a cab or someone to pick you up. Also the could be used to teach people how to drive. You can put them behind the wheel and just let them get a feel of what it's like to have your hands on the wheel and feel the car turn and drive.

Other potential uses for a driverlees car could be preventing accidents. They could make cars with such good reaction time that it would stop before a human could possibly do it. I mean the car may need help with stuff like pulling in and out of driveways, but it can do stuff that most have trouble doing like parallel parking.

Before they allow these cars out on the road first they have to get rid of some of the laws and regulations about driverless automobiles. Like if a driverless vehicles is in an accident who's fault is it? The car owner or the company that made the car? These kind of things need to be sorted out before they can start allowing these vehicles on the street.

I think driverless cars will eventually become allowed on roads and highways everywhere. But it might take awhile to finish some of the issues and concerns with the cars and the laws. But eventually people will get asked how they got to work or school instead of saying they drove they will say my car drove me.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"My position on the arguement is, no, we shouldn't have self driving smart cars. The only reason we would have self driving cars, is to please the wants of drivers now days. People would get worse, and lazier at driving from lack of experiance. The self driving cars are not fully functional either. The cars need to be equipped with hundreds of sensors, and maps that would cost a great chunk of your money too. So, by the time Your finished with the making of the car, it would not even be worth it financially. The self driving car would be a mistake if it does get street legality.

There is no need for self driving cars, unless the people want that luxiory. The is not a fuction that the self driving car can preform that, us as humans, can not do ourselfs. The technology that we have in modern day cars, is almost as far advanced that we need to go, with the exception of fuel efficienty. The manufactures say that the dr0iver should stay alert at all times when they are in a self driving car in case of an emergency, but if we all have self driving cars and are not constantly testing ourselfs on our driving abilities, then how do we know that, when the time comes that you need to take over, that your diving abilities will be good enough?

The self driving cars are also still in the making of being, self drived. For a nessary self diving car, it needs a plethera of sensors and receivers. By the time manufactures do get all of this jammed into a small compact car, the price would be so outrageous, that is wouldn't be worth your money. So, in the making of the self driving car, it would be easier and cheaper to buy a manual car.

The cars themself would be financially irrlogical to produce. An estimate price to buy a brand new, compact car, is about $35,000. Thats just for the car itself. The sensors and receivers that the pland to put on the car, would skyrocket the price of an adverage compact car. Not only that, but im assuming that the cost of labor to make those cars, would also bring up the price. At the end of the day, your paying an extra $10,000 just so you dont have to touch the wheel. Your brain may say yes, but your pocketbook is saying no.

Those are the reasons why self driving cars sould not be allowed to be legalized on the streets in the United States. Not only would they cost more, but they could also Make your driving skills get worse. America should just stay with the tradititonal manual driving cars.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Senator of Florida,

What is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the ""Winner-Take-All"" sytem does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election?

Their has been many mishappens because of the Electoral College. For example, from an excerpt called ""The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" says ""The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disastor factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worst."" This shows that the electoral college does do damage to the United States because they let a huge crisis happen during the elections. They could have let it get even worst because they allow it to and make it easy to make things worst in certain crisis.

I feel like you should give the people more of a say because half of the people that vote problably don't even know that they are not actually voting for the president. They probably vote thinking that they are voting for the president not for the electoral college to see who will end up on the board. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters. Voters pay to vote, to what pay the Electoral College to vote and make their say so important it is sad. The reason it is sad is because all kids want to do when their younger is vote because they feel like it symbolizes them growing up and like they get a real say in who the next president is or the senate anything just as longs as they get a say. But truthful their not getting a say in who will be the next senate, treasurer, or president their actually picking the board who will be picking for them.

Even the People once wanted to abolish the Electoral College. These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong."" is sates ""They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" It also states that ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidancy."" This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. They practicly alredy know who is going to win the election before the voting even begins because the board already has it all planned out.

So really thier is no need for the Electoral College because all they do is make the competion unfair for the other person going for the election. Also, because they have cause or been a part of problems and mishappens. In an article it mentions ""Perhaps moat worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, were staes delegation vote on president."" Also, when you are voting for the Vice-President you are not actually voting the senat picks who the Vice-President is. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters and the people running in the election.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I don't agree with changing it because sometimes students cant help that they don't have a B average or higher in all their classes. Teachers are a big thing that helps you in a class or tears you down in a class. If you don't understand the teacher or don't understand the class or even don't get along with the teacher then that can change the way you work and act in the class. You could only be missing a B by 1 or 2 points and that means you cant play any sports until that is a B average and sports are important for some kids. I believe it should be determined by your homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Sports are important to some kids and all but they have to be abill to do good in class as wail as in there chosen sport. In personal reference i am pushed to do good in school and i am unable to do sports until i bring my grades or grade to a passing average. That's one of my family's rules no sports if there is not all passing grades on report card. I personally know many students that live to play sports and come to school to play sports and they try their hardest in class but don't always achieve their goals in the classroom so that means they cant play. That's why i believe it should be averaged on homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Other family's might think differently about it than i do but this is how i feel about being abill to play sports as long as you are doing well in all of your classes.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Many people participate in after school activities. Choosing to do so but some people prefer going home and resting after the long school day. But what if your principal said you have to participate in an extracurricular activity in order to go to this school. This may help you in many ways it could provide a way to talk and socialize with friends or make new ones. If it was a sport that involves any type of moving it would make you more fit and healthy. I would agree with the principals idea it introduces the kids to many things they have not done before and they might not of known they liked it or were good at it.

There are many benefits in extracurricular activities that you might not of known. Whether it would help you now or in the future. It is very healthy to participate in any activity because it can help you physically and even mentally improving your ability with your social skills in the result of you talking with your teammates or other people constantly. And how it can help you physically is in basically any sport you play. Your moving around constantly improving your endurance and strength it makes you more fit and healthy.

While there are many advantages with this idea every idea comes with some disadvantages. But I have ways to counter them. Some people are not as fortunate as us and many sports have a fee to sign up as a result to that some families might not be able to afford that fee. So the school fills that gap from the cliff stopping that student from participating offering many activities that do not require a fee or any sort of paying. And if they do the school can fill that gap with the extra money they have, you can even donate to the school so the school can keep providing their students with the money they need in order to sign up.

A lot of sports have practices almost every night and it might last until 9:00. So when you get home your exhausted and you don't feel like doing your homework or any project thats due soon. And its hard to find the time to do it. In the result of that the school makes the study halls or resources longer so you have time to finish your homework, essay, or school project. This will take the stress off of the students and let them sleep for a healthy amount of time instead of staying up late trying to finish that project.

the after school activity does not have to be a sport. It could be volunteering for school council or fighting for the the best design of the yearbook. This also comes with a lot of benefits. Designing the year book is not an easy task trying to make the best possible one making you use your imagination as hard as you ever had making the most unique and creative one. So the judges would select yours as the winner. And volunteering for student council is just as hard to trying to satisfy all of the students needs and opinions making ideas that are mature but also good this makes you think out of the box and your comfort zone.

Overall the principles Idea is a very good one that will improve the liveliness of the school. Making every student active is very important because it improves their mental health and physicall health. It will also help the students in the future providing scholarships for them to big colleges and programs. Making them feel more comfortable in front of bigger crowds. Students might not like the principles idea now but will thank him a couple years down the road.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I don't like how the students have to pick what they what to do what if they don't what to do noting and I feel like they are getting focus to do something they don't what to do. But some kids would like it because they like sports or to work on the yearbook for the school or take serve on the student council. But the other student they dont like to do any of that but they are being focus to do stuff.

The principal should not focus the kids to do something they don't what to do the principal should ask if they what to do it or not. Because that is more stuff that they got to do and it is not fair on them. And the kids are not going to like there principal no more because the principal is making them do stuff that they don't what to do. And I feel like they should have freedom.

I disagree I just don't see how I't is fair to the students that don't what to do it and you can not get mad at them because that is a lot that they got to do you them they got homework to do they got class work to just so much stuff they got to do.

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents. The details that help support this claim is that for example ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus, because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Another reason is that, "" Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.."" the author then begins to mention some of the features that Venus has as well as Earth, such as valleys, mountains and craters. Now despite the dangers that could and can come from taking a visit down to Venus hasn't stopped NASA from trying to find ways to make this mission ""both safe and scientifically productive"". Within the text it states that, ""NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" then it gives examples such as a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape."" NASA is still working on other possible approaches to make this mission happen. Sure there may be many challenges effecting Scientisits and researchers from exploring and studying Venus, but that dosen't mean its impossible. Towards the end of the of the text the last supporting details that conclude that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is the follwoing, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" and ""Our travles on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."".

"Reasons Why We Shouldn't Use This Technology!

The idea in which we can read human emotions is not an easy thing to do. The amount of time, technology, and effort is extraordinary. The fact that we achevied this goal in technology is outstanding! However to most this feat as great as it is could seem actually pointless with only some good things about it. I personally believe that its not something society really needs at this time.

Sure this technology advancement can be used in some situations. In fact one of the biggest things this could be used for is to basiclly replace the polygraph system. The Polygraph test could be obsolete compared to this technology.+ This technology breakthrough can be used by law enforcement to determine whether or not someone is telling the truth. This could make procicutions faster and even hopefully more efficent.

Humans instinctivly hide away from their emotions. They divert them by thinking of other things. But for one to hide their expression is not that simple however. To some this tecchnology could possibly come off as a breach of privicy. No matter how great this opurtunity could be.

The flaws that thing thing could have are quite emense if you think about it. To have something be able to read you like a book almost just by a facial expression must be difficult. The algorithms are extremely complex as stated in paragraph 7. One simple misread of this algorithim could sevearly change the outcome.

This technology could truly be revolutionary for man kind. However this may only truly have one use. And that is to replace the Polygraph Test. Otherwise there may truly be no use for it besides for curiosity. That is why I stand against this technology. That as well as it could possibly be a breach of privicy. This technology could invade simeones personal life. That is truly the main reason I disagree with this. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"My postion on driverless cars are simple reasons why i dont trust them .I wouldnt feel safe walking down the treeet know ing that a driverless car is driving 25-30 miles next to me and them mess up and hit me. There are so many reasons why we shouldnt and here just a few .

I feel that driverless cars have some faults because for some big reasons succh as if we get into and accident who would know what happened would it be ther car or the driver and it would take a long time to figure out .

Another reason would be that if they had driverless cars we wuld have to have a special liscense and so many people would have to retake the driiver test and so much more. Its crazy because the fact is this that people would have so much of a harder time of driving the driverless cars because you never know when the car will mess up and you have to take over theres so much little detail that we havent worked out yet .

I feel that if we were to have driverless cars that people wouldnt know how to act that some people would be stupid with them and we already have a problem with texting and driving, i feel like his would bring the same concept to people .If we can be hand free with out driving it would be crazy people would be doing the craziest stuff if they were hand free.

Then there the way in part of the article it said ""even if traffic laws change we would need new laws to in the case of an accident "" so why do we need smart cars when in all reality we just need people to pay atttention to the road .Fot my conclusion i feel that were fine with cars that have a driver and that i feel its more safer than driverless cars .",0,persuade_corpus,1
"How often are you seeking multiple opinions? If you are, is it helpful to you, or is it not? If you don't seek multiple opinions do you sometimes wish you did? Would you have made a better choice? People who tend to seek multiple opinions are more successful on what they are working on. Seeking multiple opinions can help people make better choices because, you will get ideas from a different point of view, help you see multiple outcomes, and you will think in a more diverse way.

First , seeking multiple ideas will help you make better choices because you will see ideas from a different point of view. Also, seeking multiple ideas will help you think differently. For example, most students who don't look for multiple opinions just end up only seeing things one way and not being open minded. That being said, kids would normally just look for one opinion just to get what they are doing out of the way so they don't have to worry about it anymore. that is why seeking multiple opinions will help make better choices because you will see ideas from a different point of view.

Second, seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices by helping you see multiple outcomes. Also, kids tend to just pick something and go with it and not think about there outcome, which can hurt them in the future. For example, kids who tend to not think about the outcome end up not knowing what they are getting themselves into. That being said, thinking about your outcome will help you become smarter and more strategically. That is why seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices by seeing multiple outcomes.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices by thinking in a more diverse way. For example thinking more diversely goes a long way, and will only help you farther on in life and almost never hurt you.

Also, thinking diversely will help you think in a different way which is very beneficial. That being said, thinking diversely will give you the best understanding of your task and what you are supposed to be doing. that is why seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices by thinking in a more diverse way.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help people make the best choices because, you will get thoughts from another point of view, help you see the most outcomes, and you will think in a very diverse way. next time you have something to think about I want you to think about seeking multiple outcomes and see if it helps you out. I definitely encourage you to try it out on your next decision. I almost almost always seek multiple opinions when I am about to make a decision. I find that seeking multiple opinions to be very helpful. whenever I don't sometimes I wish I did.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In today's world mainly everyone we see has a phone or some kind of electronic device in their possession, now that's not a problem the problem is the fact that people will use these devices while driving, that distracts them from the road resulting in catastrophic consequences.

I believe people should not have their phone in their hands or looking at it while they drive because it distracts them from the road. The correlation between phone usage and accidents is 1.6 million crashes every year. Many people don't see it as such a bad thing or a something that is so important but in reality it is. When you stare at your phone for just second while driving that can cause you to not pay attention to anything that can happen around you.

It's okay for people to use them when they are parked in a safe place away from where people can get hurt such as a parking lot or a driveway but if you are at a red light and you start to use it that is just as dangerous as actually driving and looking down at it. No circumstance should allow for anyone to use their phones while driving unless they are an emergency response vehicle such as police firefighters or emt. I hope people see and realize the dangers of driving while texting and see that the lives of others around them are just as important because anything can change in a split second.

If some people don't see the big problem of texting and driving, then they shouldn't have a phone or be allowed to drive. Many people die every day because of this problem and none realize how bad this problem is in reality. People need to stop using phones while driving and start thinking about the safety and presence of others around them.             ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I, for one, disagree with this statement. i find it unfair for a student to have a grade B average. i can understand C average but a B is hard to keep for some students, once you have gone up to one, or down to one. Mostly the students have

C averages and i think that with this going on, there will be no soccer tem, or football team or basketball team, or volleyball team.

i understand that maybe an upside to this whole statement is to probably motivate students to try harder to be able to have a privilege of being on that basketball team or that football team or that volleyball team.

But sir, what you do exceed of thinking is that what if young RELATIVE_NAME had an A plus in science and he forgot to study for the chemistry test on Friday, and little did he know that exact test was worth 50% of his grade? RELATIVE_NAME failed that test, and ended up having a c in science, giving him a C grade average. RELATIVE_NAME love football and he wanted a scholar ship, but never got because he didn't go to the finals with the rest of the team, simply because he missed one particular test.

Once you down from an A to a B, you try to figure out what was wrong and you try to work on it, but what if nothing was worth as much as what you missed? what if one 50% test was equal to three more of those tests? Going up from a C to a B is exciting, but you're trying to keep up the good work. once you do, you can't get overly exited, or else you might feel a little over whelmed and get a little ""big headed"" and mess up on the whole thing you had going for a while.

A sport should not be handled as a privilege, it she handled as a recommendation. because kids can always go to a public team and try out there. that's just making the team here at school seem more ""exclusive"" which is basically pointless.

Another hypothetical question, sir; What if little RELATIVE_NAME, has okay grades, but no social skills? Isn't that what sports are all about? social skills, working together, and exercise. Those are the three magic words to get into a great high school.

"Participating in the seagoing program was the best thing that ever happened to me. Even if it does't seem that interesting, you should try it. I know, some people don't like do get out much but this is better than anything you can do inside.

It is a very good experiance to go seagoing. You get to see a lot of different places and meet different people with different life styles. Sometimes it is weird hearing them talk, but sometimes it can be funny. The people also ask about our country. They wonder about the people, food, and animals that we have. They also wonder what our houses look like.

I very much wish so that you will go seagoing, because it's the best thing you will ever do. If it doesn't interest you thats ok. There are millions of other things to do. Maybe it's just not for you. But for me, it's just right.      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Extracurricular activities is one of the most underrated parts about school. I believe we should all participate in at least one extracurricular activities. These activities helps the students more then you think. Extracurricular activities helps the person build character. It also gives the students opportunity in life and helps them gain experience, meet new people. That can also get help for homework and school.

Extracurricular activities such as sports helps the student build there character. In sports the student works in a team and listen to the coaches instructions. By letting other people finish their sentences and listening to them. That helps them become a better listener. In sports and in other clubs the student is held accountable for there actions. By knowing the the students actions have consequences and there team depends on them. That helps the student to work hard not to make any excuses. In sports the students have to help their team mates. In a activity if the students team mates needs help on any thing. The student should help them, by helping other people the students builds a strong character.

Students can join new groups and teams and learn new skills, such as cooking cleaning and more. With those experiences it might help them get a job in future. It would look really good on a students job a placation form. If a student wants to become a chef we should have a cooking club. In this club the students learn how to make food and drinks. So when the student wants to become a chef, he already knows the basics before every one else. Also in the group the students can learn how to manage there time under pressure. This is a very important experience that should know. This can help the students on other jobs.

If students are having trouble in school. We should make a group or club where students can get help, from other students on school work, projects and quizzes. With this group the students grades can improve. That might get to know some new test taking skills. Also in this group students are able to talk to new friends and make new friends. Their also able to work on each other weakness and help it become stronger.

Thats why I think we should all participate in at least one extracurricular activities. These groups helps us make new friend, learn new experiences and help us build our character. Some of these groups can also be turned into classes.",0,persuade_corpus,3

"I think students doing home assignments will not benefit the student, because it doesn't help the student grasp the same kind of concepts like other students that do go to school.

The reason why I personally don't like home schooling is because if I'm at home I wouldn't get my work done. I'd be distracted by looking at my dog and looking at what my mom would be doing. Another reason why I would not like it is because I'm not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldn't have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical musuems with them. When you're home schooled you're mostly self-taught.

One other reason why I wouldn't reccommend home schooling is because you're not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why home schooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why home schooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parent may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner.

I think home schooling is a bad idea is because he wouldn't get the proper education like most students in school. That could possibly effect the student and also that student is not interacting with other students which could lead to depression and axiety. If the parent loses their patience the child would start to act up on them. For all of these reasons home schooling is not a good idea. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Some people might think that the Face photograph taken from 1976 is an alien artifact, an alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However the Face is in fact a natural landform or a Martian Mesa. A Martian mesa is common around Cydonia or the Red Planet.

The evidence that the Face is a natural landform is because the Face was found around Red Planet or the Cydonia that commonly have Martian mesa . Even though the Martian mesa looks like a face, it is actually a giant rock formation ""which resembles a human head...formed by shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also, when the Face was taken again on April 5,1998, by Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team with a ten times sharper camara compared to the origional Viking photos, it reveals that the Face was ""no alien monument after all."" Still, some doubt the picture of the Face because it was not in the right weather or angle. However, when Mars Global Surveyor took the picture of the face again at the right angle and weather, it revealed that the face was actually a Martian which is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

Some people might still think that the Face is an alien artifact, alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However, the Mars Global Surveyor showed and provide evidence that the Face was a natural landform or a Martian Mesa that is common around the Red Planet.

"If you were in Europe on a cattle boat what would you do? First of all here's some things you would do or what you want to do.

Ok 1945, world war was over in Europe, and many countries were left in reins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA [ the United Nations relief and rehabilitation administractor].

UNRRA hired seagoing Cowboys to take care of the animals that were shied overseas. Those were the things you would've had to do.

The thing that you want to do is help people out you would have the opportunity to go to Europe and China. It would take about 2 weeks to cross Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. So caring for the animals is a nice and helpful thing that would keep you busy. Stalls had to be cleaned out every single day and you have to feed them. Helping out at a farm would prepare you for hard work. You would be very happy in Europe on a cattle boat exspeacally if you are a man. You would get little hurt but not for long.

"Techology has become a very large part of our society and plays a big role in our everyday lives. As technology continues to advance and people are presented with new opportunities we didn't have before, we begin to rely more and more on technology instead of ourselves or other people. Many schools have proposed the question, ""Should students be able to attend classes through video conferences at home? Would they benefit from it?"" Allowing students to do this would only hurt them and their futures. It is evident that students need to continue to attend school in person in order to learn how to work with other people, make friends and meet new people, and be able to see teachers when help is needed.

It is important that students continue to attend classes in person so they can learn to work in groups, preparing them for their future. Many, if not all, occupations available for students in the future recquire them to be able to work with others, and share ideas with other people. Working in groups, also allows students to become comfortable sharing their ideas with other people, teaches them to accept criticism, and helps them learn that two brains are better than one when trying to solve a problem. Most importantly, working in pairs or groups teaches students to respect the opinions of other people, even if they don't agree with them, causing them to be more respectful and accepting of others in general. If students were not recquired to go to school, they would miss out on the opportunity that would prepare them to work with other people in the future.

If students ceased taking classes in person, they would no longer be able to meet new people or make connections with friends as easily as they would if they saw them every day at school. Polls have shown that a majority of the friendships students in elementary, middle, and high school have, were formed at school, with few being from extracurricular activities. Going to school, students are surrounded by the same people every day, and are put into classes with a variety of different people, whom they usually may not connect with, where they are able to establish relationships and become friends. This produces more outgoing and friendly people who are able to get along well with others, boosting their self confidence. Students who take classes online would be unable to meet new people which could severely effect their happiness and cause them to feel isolated or alone.

Often after being taught new lessons, students are confused and have questions to ask their teachers. Being in school allows students the opportunity to ask teachers for help and ask questions. Studies show that it is easier for students to learn when face to face with their teacher, watching what the teacher is doing. Many students actually learn from being walked through problems or equations with their teachers, asking questions, and then trying one on their own with a teacher nearby to help if needed. If all students were to video chat with their teacher and try to learn new topics, they would find it very difficult for each of them to be able to ask their questions and grasp what they're being taught, thus causing their grades to slip. However, if students continued to attend classes at school, they would be able to go back later and ask the teacher for help, or find another teacher that could also answer their questions.

Attending school in person, as opposed to online, provides students with an environment in which they can learn to work well with others, make friends and meet new people, and ask for help when necessary. All of these things are extremely important to the development of students both cognitively and socially, allowing them to grow and learn as children so that in the future when they are out on their own, they can prosper as responsible, outgoing, and intelligent adults able support themselves. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"As a scientist at NASA and from the research made by other scientists here at NASA I can tell that this here face is nothing more than just a landform. The Face is just a natural landform, it is not created by aliens. Although many people would love to think that the Face wa created by aliens, it is not. The face is widely spred out as far as 2 miles wide. This enomous head has cought a lot of media attention such as being in a Hollywood film, appearing in books, magzines, radio talk shows, and even radio talk shows.

This landform has become a pop icon, but even with all of this attention it doesn't change the fact that it is nothing more than just another mysterious looking landfrom on Mars. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all.""

After 22 years, from this first 1976 Viking 1 photograph pf the Face of Mars there was a picture that was taken of the same face ten times sharper than the original that blew away scientists and web surfers showing that there was no alien monument after all. This shows that the Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural landform on Mars.       ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that the policy of having at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities is the correct thing to do. I believe this because, students who don't have at least a B average, or better, won't be able to handle having a good grades in school. They'll either be to busy to not do homework or to lazing to do school work. Or the student will be too sleepy in class. Also the student might not be focusing in school as much as they used to.

My first reason for this policy to be passed is that, if the below B average student goes to his or hers sport practices or meetings they would probably neglect their homework and school work. Which would cause the student to get an even lower grade average! Unlike with an A or B student who would always at least try to complete their school work and homework.

Another good reason to pass this policy of yours would be that, the student wouldn't have enough sleeping time, which again would make them struggle in school even more. If the below B average student was actually worried about their below average gradethey would",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Why does a person ask multiple people when seeking for advise? When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. There are many advantages for asking multiple people when seeking for advise. Asking multiple people can help a person make a better choice because it helps him or her understand the better options and different possibilities when solving a problem.

Having better options can help a person make a better choice. For example, high school students can ask their teachers or parent about what college to attend. Their parents and teacher might have different opinions on different colleges. As parents, they might want their children to find a college thats closer to them and teachers might give options that relates to the students' high school courses. The high school student can listen to their advises and better decide which college to attend.

People's minds think differently. If a person ask more than one person with a math problem, they might have different ways to solve the problem. It helps the person see the different possibilities of ways to solve the problem. The person can understand the different ways and see which is best for them so that next time they can use that method to find the best answer.

When seeking for advise, it's best to ask multiple people. When asking multiple people, a person can see the different way of solving a problem and it helps them understand the best options. That's why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.         ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Driverless cars would be very beneficial to our society. It would make an immense impact on our culture and provide simple, fast ways to get around. In the article, many different positives are thoughouly expressed. Because of these specific examples, I believe that driverless cars will be extremely important in America's future and greatly benefit our use of transportation.

The United States, as well as other parts of the world, experience oil and fuel issues. There are frequent shortages of these particular substances, which are extrememly important for our daily lives. In the article, it is said, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" In this quote, from the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" Google cofounder Sergey Brin expresses that these driverless cars will be beneficial to America and the rest of the world. He says that these cars will use less fuel, which unfortunately tends to run short. Driverless cars will benefit the the world's fuel issues.

Another positive to driverless cars are the entertainment and noficiation aspects. Drivers will be able to get different things done while driving. They also will no longer need to worry about distraction factor of driving. Drivers won't have to worry about trying to answer a phone call, respond to a text, or change a song and drive at the same time. The article states, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to driveres trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" In this quote, Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, explains that a driver won't need to worry about answering a text. The driver can answer the text or phone call while the car is not in need of assistance. Fortunately, the car only needs manual assistance in areas of road construction or accidents. This feature of driverless cars will greatly benefit driving today.

However, these driverless cars still do obtain some faults. These faults are included in the article. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" This shows that drivers must retain some sort of awareness of what is going on around them. They cannot take naps or completely zone out, especially when approaching an accident or work zone. Although there are few flaws to the designs of driverless cars, these flaws should be fixed very soon. The article states, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" This quote shows that many of these issues should be resolved in the very near future.

Because of these specific examples in the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I believe that driverless cars will be very beneficial to America and it's many modes of transportation. Driverless cars will use less fuel than our typical cars we use today. They will also require an immensely small amount of attention. Most importantly, any small flaw that these cars possess will be resolved extremely soon. Driverless cars will change our lives for the better.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Imagine being able to attend classes in the comfort of your own home. In fact, many individuals believe in the the benefits of a student being able to attend classes from home. While it seems like a great idea for the students it's a downfall to their ability to learn and grow as an individual. Being able to attend classes from home would open the door for the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development of the individual.

One reason that attending classes from a place other than school is a bad idea is because it opens up the opportunity to be able to cheat. When at home who is there to be able to stop the student? Many individuals will find themselves intrigued with the idea of passing all their classes because they have all of the resources right there in front of them. When doing classes at home there is no way to monitor the way that students learn the information or if they are even learning it at all. The ability to cheat skyrockets as soon as the option of distance learning is introduced. Having the benefit of being at home gives students the time to come up with answers that they might not know. Every student will look for an easy A and having the opportunity to take the classes from home makes the possibilities endless for that so called ""prefect grade"".

In addition to cheating there is the aspect of distractions all around the individual. Many will say that their home is where they feel most comfortable. So in that case it goes to show that having the ability to learn at home, individuals will be faced with many challenging distractions. Being at home is like an invitation to a candy shop, so many options but what to choose? Will the individuals do their work or will they decide to mess with their siblings, play with their dogs, make food, call a friend, go out, or do their work? With school work being the students number one priority, there will come many challenging decisions, but if they didnt have the ability to attend the classes from home then the distractions would decrease tremendously. Students already tend to struggle in the classroom environment so adding in the possible comfort of their home is really asking them to do the impossible. They wont be able to focus on school work or have the access to the tools that will make them most successful.

Lastly, when attending classes at home an individuals social development can be slower. Having the ability to interact with others on a daily basis is very important to the growth of ones social abilities. When working from home students have the ability to isolate themselves from others which slows their development down. Going to school allows individuals to interact with teachers and peers which helps them to develop who they are as a person. If an individual just sits at home all day and isolates them self then they won't develop their own character because it's as if they are just living in a bubble. When at home by themselves the students also don't get the communication skills needed to succeed in social development.

While on the other hand, some will say that in the comfort of their own home they will do better and have a greater chance of success. They believe that they can focus more in an environment where they are most comfortable. Individuals feel as if there is less pressure on them because they dont always have that figure standing over them as they would if they were in the classroom. While in reality ones home is too comfortable and you need the constant nagging to be able to get done what needs to get done.

So in conclusion being at school and involved with the contact of everyday people is the best choice for an individual to succeed. Attending classes from home would only open up the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development. So now the questions yours, does it benefit the student to work from home with many downfalls?",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. The author supports this claim by stating that the insight to be gained is significant and by offering methods for obtaining these insights despite the danger that is readily appearant.

Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment. Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.

NASA is one organization that has been developing particularly interesting ideas about how to further study Venus. They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.

According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point. Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.

The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The principle has decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I don't agree because, we already have enough to do at school. We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to. We already hate being in school.

"Most schools require student to do summer projects of various types, but should they be teacher-designed or student-designed? Some people may agree that summer projects should be student-designed as they believe it would be better for students to make their projects based on anything of the students interest and it would be easier for them to complete the projects, but summer projects should be teacher-designed because the projects will include restrictions that students would have to follow and can help student create their projects based on a topic.

To begin with, summer projects should have restrictions which may be easily given by teachers. If there were not to be any restrictions, then students would have the ability to make their projects about anything they would like. In addition, a student could put anything they would like into their projects, but if a teacher added restrictions, the student will make their projects based on what the teacher required them to do. Restrictions can also help students' summer projects to be neat and organized. For example, students could have no idea what to make their projects about, resulting in having a bunch of nonsense put on their projects, but when students are given restrictions, it can help them think of what the teacher would want to see on their projects and what they would not want to see. To summarize, teachers should have the ability to give restrictions for their students summer projects.

Secondly, if the summer projects student were required to complete were to be student-based, some students could make their project based on a topic that is coeducational; instead, summer projects should be based on what the student has learned in school and should include skills they have been taught. For example, if a history teacher asks students to complete their projects based on a historical event they have learned and are interested in, students will have an educational-based topic and could possibly add skills like critical thinking. This also gives students a subject to make their projects based on and gives students options. In addition, if a student needs to complete a project for their science teacher, they would be required to make their project science-related. To summarize, teacher-designed projects will help students make it educational-based and give student options.

In conclusion, summer projects required by some schools should be teacher-designed. I agree with this because teacher-designed projects can come with restrictions that will help students have an idea and be organized when completing their projects and teacher-designed projects will require students and give them a subject to make their projects on and give them options that are based on what they have learned. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I disagree with the Driverless car. Any one could get hurt,and any thing could happen. The Driverless car s unnecessary and many ways. I will be telling you why I disagree with it and why it unnecessary.

The Driverless car is unnecessary because it will make people more lazy,and not want to do things. Doing that is not healthy,and it could turn and to bad habits. Having the Driverless car can make you lazy and being lazy can cause many health issues. It is not a good idea.

"I think asking multiple people for advice is a very helpful thing because it gives people more to think about. Different people have their own reasons on their own opinions. It helps a lot of people when asking different opinions especially if the topic is very con traversal like sports on who is better then others and thats why it's good to ask for reasons as well. The person asking might also not know about what he or she is specifically asking advice for.

Asking multiple people is like asking what color is better and why. It's always a good thing to ask obviously if you don't know anything about the topic. Someone can give you a reasonable reason to make you be on one side of the topic more then the other. People's opinions can also give you more knowledge about the specific something. People should always prove their answers especially opinions because different people like to give false information.

Multiple advice from others with reasonable reasons can lead to an actual fact. There is a difference between a fact and opinion but then there are personal reasons. Most are mostly opinion based topics where something is better then the other or someone looks better thats all just actual opinion. When asking people for someones opinions on whatever it is you should compare two people's reasons. Also when asking for advice let them know why you wanna know.

When listening to peoples opinions or advice make sure it always makes sense. Asking for ones advice will want you to listen to others. And when Asking for their advice or opinion make sure you keep asking until you feel comfortable. I know a lot of people dont like when others asking for their opinions but it's actually a good thing sometimes it's more helpful then others think and a lot of people dont like it it because they are either scared or don't know anything about the topic. When people do ask it's mostly because they want to hear if someone else will say the same reason as to why they picked what they picked.

In conclusion asking multiple people for their opinion or advice is con traversal but it does help and it does let you know more about what your asking. Example of asking for this is what is better a stripped tee or a plain tee and why is it better. It's never a bad thing just know when you ask for someones opinion make sure your asking someone who knows a lot about the specific topic or whatever it is. asking multiple people for advice can make you let others know about the specific topic. Don't ever feel embarrassed asking others for advice because once you know a lot about the topic or what ever it is then people will start asking you about the topic so then your going to know what is true and what's not true. Asking others for advice is for things you don't know.              ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I think it is a good idea that the principle is doing that because some students can have a good B average. All they go to do is do they homework correctly and respect their teacher and you know if they want to participate in school activity they could do that.

"Dear school administrator,

I do not agree with this decision at all, many of the students can not keep up with the curriculum and a C grade is maybe the farthest their effort will get them, some students are to caught up in their sport that they might not be able to keep up with the class, maybe you can lower the grade average, or think of other alternatives to get the student where they need to be.

Many students work and try hard in school, but yet still don't get A and B grades. They shouldn't be punished by penalizing them from the sport they love to play. One of my best friends plays on the school's basketball team and i see how hard she has to work to get the grades she is earning. If she worked that hard and still got a C, then i think the school should still let her play basketball because she had done all her assignments, completed all of her missing work and worked hard to try and stay on that team, and for the school to say that she cant play because she has a C would be truly unfair to her. Maybe a student is to caught up in their sport to even keep up with their homework or projects.

A lot of times a student is playing a sport, and that's the only thing their life revolves around at the moment. They put their social life on hold, they put their school work aside, and that sport is the only thing that matters to them. For example, last year in seventh grade I was involved in an after school sport. Each day i would come home at three o' clock from school. After a long day, i' d get my things ready for practice and made sure i had every single thing i needed. I would then make sure i had a healthy snack and i would leave for practice. Practice usually lasted about three to three and a half hours. When i was done my mom would pick me up around seven fifteen. By that time, i was very tired and worn out. We would sit down eat dinner, then i would take a quick shower and i was done for the day. At that point it was around ten o' clock and i was done for the day, i was completely worn out and then it was time to go to bed. As you can see, it is very hard for students to complete their work after school when they are in a busy sport. It would probably just be best to lower the grade or give an alternative to the children enabling them to make that average grade of a B.

Sometimes a student needs some time to do homework during school or extra credit. Some alternatives could be, an extra class that helps students on homework opr even just extra credit.

Why drive someplace that's down the street, when you could save the gas and money and walk, or maybe even ride a bike? All around the world people use cars to their advantage and even though it seems like just a little ride around the block, it's really making more pollution spread out into the air. Vauban,Germany has made the decision to ban all cars. There are two ways to keep your car: by buying a parking lot space down town, $40,000, along with a home; or large car garages at the edge of the development.

Taking away stress is another advantage for giving up your car. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walking doesn't add pollution to the air. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe; and up to 50  percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Bikes and scooters have the same effect as a car, just with less pollution. Just by riding a bike you are not only not sending out pollution, you are getting a free workout. Just by even car pooling you are saving your country from being overthrown by polluted air.

""All of our development since the World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Golberg, an official of Transportation for America, ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid."" Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be apporved this year. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

The car is one way to get around town, to travel, to car pool. However, with one less car we could change the way we live in the future. Imagine, less smog, more people walking and riding bikes to get to places, and less people being stressed. We could be setting a forever-lasting trend.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Beep Beep! I've been waiting here for hours! Is what most people are saying nowadays. So many people rely on vehicles for transportation. This means that we can get places faster sure. But that also means there is alot of disadvantges to this as well. I'm going to talk about the advantages of limiting car usage.  A few points i want to talk about are the reasons why it's better to limit car usage. Why it's better for us to not have cars if we have a job near by. The gas will keep getting higher and higher.

The first thing i'm going to talk about is the advantages of limiting you're car use. Every one knows that we rely on our vehicles to get us from place to place. In big cities there are alot of people so that means there is more traffic which backs everything up for hours at a time. This is called a smog. If we all would take a day off from our cars once a week it would make a big difference. It would also help out on the pollution as well.

Another thing i would like to talk about is that we should think about getting rid of our cars if we live in a community. If everything you need is within walking distance why would you need one? People in Germany are doing that today and are doing very well. One person said ""When i had a car i was always tense, I'm much happier now."" The United States are thinking about doing that and they are calling it ""smart planning"".

The next thing i would like to talk about is the gas will keep getting higher and higher and the air will keep getting more polluted. ""Americans are buying fewer cars , driving less, and getting fewer licenses."" So we are making the first step torwards that. A recent study shows that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company said  he wants to create cities in which "" pedestrian, bicycle, private cars,  commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time , conserve resources , lower emissions and improve safety"". So we are working torwards this but i am sure it will take some time. I know some people will not want to give up there vehicles but the government can just fine them if they drive their cars on days that are prohibited.

So all in all i think we should go through with limiting the usage of vehicles. If we can't do anything at least make more vehicles that are eco friendly to the invironment. I think we should limit car use. Get rid of most of our cars if we live in a community. And that the gas will keep risisng higher and higher do to how many of us need it.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Senator,

I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College.  Many people say that it is ""outdated, irrational, and unfair"" but that is an opion.  Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is benificaial rather then destructive.  Out of these many reasons i am able to narrow it down to 2 reasons about why the Electoral College should be kept.  These reasons are Everyones President, and Swing States.

In Richard A. Posners' aritcle about keeping the Electoral College he talks about the President that is elected being everyones this President.  ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-reginal appeal.  No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""  This is not also a great example but it is a great counterclaim to Bradford Plumers article.  In PLumers article he states that, ""candiadtes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the the tight races in the ""swing"" states.  The Electoral College assures that the President isnt just wanted in one area that is wanted all around the country.  Electoral Colleges assure that the President is wanted in many differt parts of the United States.

""The electoral college invariably produces a clear winner,"" says Posner in his article.  A way of producing a clear winner is by having swing states.  Some people argue about the Electoral College turning off potential voters, (Democrats in Texas) but this may actually determine the election.  If those other party people dont vote who knows mabey if they had voted their party might have been luckly.  Statistics prove that when certaint parties win contriversial states thats because some people from 1 party didnt vote.  No voting especailly in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candiadate loose the election.  Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win.

The Electoral College is something that this country needs for our benifit.  It helps us Americas get a President that will benifit us all not just those in certaint areas.  Although some peopel dont think that the Electoral College is helping there are twice as many people who believe that just a popularity vote is a bad idea.  Having swing states, and having a way that finds ""everyones"" president are just few of the many exaples about why we need the Electoral College.

"Dear Principle,

The 2 policies are very reasonable but i only agree to one. I think that policy 1 is better for a few reasons. The first reason is because if kids have the liberty to have cell phones, then if there is a emergency, they can quickly get help or call 911. another reason is because during free time, if kids can text each other, there will be less talking and distracting noise in the classrooms or at lunch.

There are some disadvantages to policy 1 that might convince you to switch your opinion to policy 2. One reason is because cell phones can go off in class if students forget to turn them off between periods. another reason is because cell phones can become very distracting and can keep students away from work. some cell phones have games or other entertaining app's on their phone that would be hard to avoid playing.

The reason i go with policy 1 is because students need opportunities to be safe and express freedom in America. If kids get cell phones in school then it would express their rights as citizens. Cell phones are very helpful in emergencies. An example; a kid named justice is in the class Concepts of Engineering and Tech and he is working with some equipment when he accidentally cuts his finger bad. One student could call 911 while the other could call justices parents and warn them in a matter of seconds. Even if they are distractions they can also save lives.

I do encourage you to pick cell phone policy 1 because i believe that it is the right choice for our school. Sure policy 2 is better for education but the principle of having cell phones makes a big difference.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"That some schools offer the option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that this option is a really good idea for the students. This option can benefit many students that cannot attend schools in the regular schedule. Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies.

Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies.

The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom.

One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people.

As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future.

I think that if more schools provide distance learning as option for the student, more people can get involve and be benefit with this program, and get better opportunities on their life. Because now that the school are doing this is not excuses to not finished the school.                      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Senator,

I don't think that we should keep the Electoral College because I truly believe that as the people of our country, we should have the freedom to vote for whom we think best fits the role of our president. I'll tell you why.

I have read this passage about three times in a row and I've gotten a better understanding of how the Electoral College works. I can understand an opinion that thinks the Electoral College is great and I'm sure it's a little less complicated and such but it's not quite fair to certain people in small states, etc. There are people who don't even see a point in voting now because they know that their vote will most likely not matter. As stated in

Source 3: In Defense of the Eletoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, paragraph 23,

""

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state--Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing thier vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..

""

I strongly disagree with people in our country feeling this way. We are together as a country. Everyone's votes should matter. We are all here as one. People will have less and less interest in voting and we will go nowhere. I believe that the people should fully understand the process and not only that. Understand who is about to become president. In the country that we the people live in. Know this persons values, are they worthy? Know the lengths that they will go for our people. People should not feel that because they're in a small state, their vote doesn't matter. It should not be this way. I do believe that voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election but don't you think that everyone should be involved and that everyone should be informed or even have an opinion on what is about to happen? I feel that there are some people who are not fully understanding the system. As said in

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong, paragraph 10,

""

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.

""

Do the people even know who these electors are? Who picks them anyways? I understand that it depends on the state but do they know that? I also read that voters can not always control whom their electors vote for. Also that sometimes, voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. This is what I mean by people not fully understanding.

This is just my opinion followed by some evidence and explanation. Maybe you could see from my point of view and anyone who has a similar one.

"Hello, I am writing to you about the Electoral College and why that I think it should be removed. Why I think we should remove the Electoral College is when voter selects the president they want they are really just picking for a elector who elects the president for them. Also this makes a single rep from Wyoming of 500,00 people has as much say as 55 reps for California who represents 35 million people. The last reason behind this is also being unfair to voters, the winner take all system where in the state the winner of the votes gets them all. So in effect a candidate would spend no time in that per say a swing state. which the may have a chance of winning.

When you vote for the president you really are not voting for him, you're voting for a elector who really elect the president. Also the question is brought up, who picks the electors? This also depends on the state could be the state party's central committee or the presidential candidate's people do. Also another question is what controls the elector from electing the wrong candidate, nothing.

Also why does a single reps in Wyoming with 500,00 people have as much say as 55 reps in California with 35 million people? That is just unfair to the voters, how could that in anyway represent what the majority of the people want. The other way the electoral collage is unfair is the winner take all system I mentioned earlier with majority votes in a state is the state vote, such as if 46 percent of people in a state voted one candidate and 54 for the other insted of just giving the candidates their votes the majority decided one would have them.

The Electoral College is also not a democratic system of voting because the people are really not deciding, and when it is said you are allowing each party to pick a trusted slate of nominees it is not true because the state's central committee not the presidential candidate's reps who are the people really needed to vote for such. In 2000 Gore had more popular votes than bush but less electoral votes, though rare to happen this the president who runs the country for four years at a time so that one rare moment could mean the future of the U.S.A . Also a president does not need to be trans-regional, they only need to appeal to swing states and not ruin relations with their states.

So that was and is my reasoning of why I think that the Electoral College should be removed from our political system. Between the being unfair to voters through voting for electors not even the president, reps not even being scaled right also the winner take all system making the system unbalanced, and the presidential candidates not even needing to appeal to most states just the swing states. I hope this passage convinces you that the Electoral College should be removed in place of a better system that is not out dated.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

DIIIINNNGGGGGGGGG! the school bell just rung and I got my report card and I have all C' s. Maybe if I have more B 's and less C 's

I can participate in school activities and sports. I think that students with a C

average should not participate in school activities because if the B students have to work hard for there grade so does the C students.. For the ones that do work hard should be rewarded. I will give three specific reasons why I think that students with a B grade average should participate in activities.

One reason I think that students with a B grade average should participate in school activities are because they should get some kind of fun at school for doing all that hard work they had to do just to past. Students with averages like that could go far. Most schools offer a lot of scholarships to go different places. I believe that having a B grade average is good but having an A grade average is better.

Another reason why students with a B grade average should participate in school activities are because they should not have to suffer with the C students that cause the B students not to do anything. I personally think that what the principal is doing is good because if he/she comes out with a policy like that then that will get the C students motivated to do better.

My last reason I think that students with a B grade average should participate in school activities are because sometimes you should be rewarded for the good work that have been done. I feel that its not any reason why a students should. I say this because if the teacher is giving you the notes and all you have to do is study them to do good on your test and other activities, these C students shouldn't do not a thing. My parents don't allow C even though I have made them a couple of times. I don't like C' s because if i got all B's on my report card then i know i could have did better with that C I had.

To conclude my letter those are my three specific reasons why students should not participate in school activities if they have a C average. Now that comes from my point of view of what I think about the situation but its not my decision because I don't run anything but my myself and my brain. I hope you have enjoyed my letter so far.

"Do you think students should have to participate in extra curricular activities? I think we shouldn't as some people may not have the time to do them or just may not want to. Some people may not like sports or just are not very good a them. Some people may not want to do anything and may just want to do homework or be with friends. There might not be enough or any options they might like. Here are some more reasons why.

The reasons why some people may not be able or want to do yearbook would be that some people may not show up to get their picture taken or they may not have the time to get to a person. Some people may not want to get their picture taken. It can be stressful sorting out whos in what grade and if they do any extracurricular activities which ones. People may get stressed over yearbook for not having enough time or things in it.

The reasons why some people may not want or be able to participate in student council would be that some people may not be able to do it they might have tight schedules and might not be able to go to the meetings after school. It can be stressful trying to figure out what to fix and helping others. Decision making might be hard as it can help some but hurt others and certain people might make bad decisions.

There are some reasons why not everyone would want to do sports to like some people might be handicapped or unfit to play sports. Some people may not like sports or may not have time after school to play them. Some people may get stressed over practices and homework. I feel like it would also just not help as some people may get bullied or laughed at for messing up.

Another problem would be that not everyone has enough time to actually do these things like some people may have family issues or need to be picked up by a certain time. Some things may take a long time and might cause problems to people who have to do homework. Some people might be sick or have to be places at a certain time.

This is why not everyone might be able to do after school activities and why I think its a bad idea.",0,persuade_corpus,3

If you joined the Seagoing Cowboys you could help a lot of people and yourself. I strongly think that you should join Luke in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for boys. In order to join the Seagoing Cowboys program you had to be a boy. You where in the Seagoing Cowboys program for as long as you wanted but, the highest was 9 trips. They take care of all types of animals and you get to go all over the world and see many different things.

First thing you do is to go over the seas. Next you find where you need to go so you can go and help the area that have animals. Second you have to help people and animals by taking them to a safe place and trying to help them with everything you have. Lastly you go back to find more or go to a new place to help new people.

Helping is a good thing for all people but, you can also look around the places you are. For example, you get to go to Greece and help cargo 335 horses and all so look at the place. Lastly you could get many items to bring back to remind you of going and helping the people that need it the most and by going somewhere fun.

If you join the program then you get to meet many different people and try many new things. But, going only for fun is not the main reason. The main reason of going is to help people, animals, and other things. It is World War 2 at the time and many animals and people are trying to help them selfs but, they can't and that is why you should help them and join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

These are all my reasons talking about why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you joined this program you could help many people and also help yourself in many ways. I extreamly think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys in there adventures and having the experience of your life helping many people in need.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard that you were reconsidering our cell phone policy and i truly believe that policy one is the best option regarding our cell phone policy. I believe policy one is the best decision because it is the year of 2011 and us students practically live off of technology. Cell phones are the only way that we communicate in our society. If cell phones are turned off during class periods then i do not see a problem. Having cell phones during free periods give us the opportunity to get in contact with our parents if needed. Sometimes after school activities are cancelled and then everyone has to go through the hassle of using your teachers phone in order to contact your parent. But if everyone had a cell phone on them during their free periods or lunch, then this would immediately eliminate the problem.

Another reason why I think that policy one is the best way to go is because some phones have internet access. Internet access can help us with our studies and finding information for a research project or a homework assignment. Although there are computers during free period, sometimes you are unfortunate and all the computers are being used. If we were aloud to use cell phones then more people would be able to get their work done during school. The last reason why i feel policy one is effective is because you can communicate with kids easily. Sometimes your friends do not have all the same classes with you and you maybe be in one class and they may be in another class somewhere across the school. If you have something important to tell them then you would have to search for them, but with cell phones you can easily just text them the important news. If you choose to pick policy one for our new cell phone policy, not only will you be making us kids the happiest kids ever but also you will be helping us a lot as you can see.

"My position on driverless cars is that there shouldnt really be driverless cars. If there are driverless cars think of how many more accidents there would be. There shouldnt be a car that can help you pull out of your drive way. The artical states that having driverless cars would be more efficant but what if its not what if there are more accidents in the US due to driverless cars then there is involving humans, it also states that it can help drive its self by accelerating itslef, braking, and steering. Humans need to be alert when behind the wheel. Driverless cars takes that away.

The automotive companies really need to think this desicion more thouroghly, because yes they would be making alot more money by coustomers buying the driverless cars but if the cars truly arent driverless like the artical says then one persokn is gonna think that its okay to fall asleep or something else and then BAM!! You have gotten in an accident and whos fault is it? Its your fault not the cars fault.

Yes driverless cars help with paying more attention but that should not be a reason to just do whatever you want behind the wheel because you thing its safe. The artical states that the BMW auto motive company had announced the development of "" Traffic Jam Assistant"" the car can only handle driving functions up to 25 miles per hour what will happen if an accident occurs of that speed limit?

"Car usage around the world has skyrocketed pollution levels tenfold. In Paris, France they had to ban driving for 2 days to help clear out the fog in the city (Source 2). Some cities have even stopped using cars altogether, many of the townspeople believe that cars just cause more stress in peoples lives (Source 1).

In Colombia, the Day Without Cars is becoming more and more popular each year. It's a great way to lower stress and air pollution (Source 3)!

Since 2005, car usage in America has gone down every year, with less people getting a license and less cars being bought each year (Source 4). It begs the question: are cars growing away from our culture? Many people would rather use public transportation or car-pool with friends than drive to work or other activities. Public transportation traffic is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (Paragraph 43).

So maybe you should ask yourself if driving really is the best way to go, because it only causes stress, pollution, and it's a danger to your safety every time you drive onto the road.

"Stress, work, jobs and injuries. Some students have all of that on their shoulders: responsibilities that they need to take care of in, and outside of school. Students can't always focus on academic studies, or activities. They have other things to do, like babysitting a child, working a job, healing themselves physically and mentally. Therefore, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students, just like some adults, have things they need to do after their 'job' is over. These things include working a job, picking up a sibling from school, or running errands for their guardians. And even if students didn't have anything thing to do after the last bell of the day rings, they shouldn't have to stay long. It should be the students choice to what they want to do, whether it's just to go home and relax, or go out with friends. School generally limits our free time and social time. Therefore, students shouldn't be force to limit their seven to eight, or more, hours of time they have to do what they want.

Besides not having time to do what students want, there's stress. Stress is like a child kicking over an anthill. It takes students long to become stress free, and stress randomly comes at times. Whether that random stress is studying for a test or class, worrying about keeping up grades, and doing homework on time. So the last thing a student needs is a child, stress, destroying their anthill. Basically what I'm saying is that requiring students participation in extracurricular activities will overflow students with stress, and eventually, they might become too overwhelmed. The mind is a fragile thing, and should be taken care of with care, just like the body. Students can't do certain activities if their body is injured. And for the some activities that they can do, the student just may want to heal fully instead of jumping back into school and receiving more stress. With that, students should decide what they want to do.

Extracurricular activities will benefit students, that is what some people may say. While I do agree some extracurricular activities will benefit students who choose to be apart of it, it may not do good for others. What good would it do for you to be apart of something that your hearts not in? Yes, it's nice to experience new things, but some experiences aren't for some people. Besides that, students have a life outside of school. They can't be expected to have school as their only responsibility. They have things that need to be done, and things they want to do. With that in mind, the students who want to be apart of after school activities should, and those who don't shouldn't have too.

Opportunities are a great thing for students, but those opportunities shouldn't be required of students to take them without any choice at all. Students have tons of responsibilities they need to attend to either way. Therefore, more stress is unneeded in the long run. In conclusion, students have a lot to stress about, free time they want, injuries to heal, jobs to be worked. So please consider the idea that students shouldn't be forced into doing extracurricular activities when it could hinder them.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well. He used many ideas to support his claim including what others think, facts, and his own thoughts.

The text states ""while Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely (p1),"" pointing out the challenge of exploring Venus. The author also states ""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us (p2),"" telling us how dangerous Venus is. He also states ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface (p3),"" pointing out the dangerous gases, pressure, temperature, and natural disasters of Venus.

""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface (p4)?"" The author states ""often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too (p2),"" meaning that Venus would be the fastest planet to travel to. He also said ""astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system (p4),"" meaning it could truly be a future habitat for the living - and may have been inhabited once. The author also said ""long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters (p4),"" suggesting that Venus may have truly been Earth's ""twin."" He also mentioned that NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus in a blimp-like structure (p5), which could work. The text stated ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation (p8),"" suggesting that finding a way to safely allow humans to travel to Venus will not only help us learn more about the most dangerous planet, but also will lead us to more exciting and intimidating endeavors. Not only that, but traveling to Venus will make us no longer be limited by dangers and doubts, allowing us to expand our minds.

To sum everything up, the author did well with supporting his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He mentioned many dangers that Venus has. He also mentioned possible solutions to the problems Venus throws at us and reasons why Venus is worth studying, using facts and thoughts as support for his claim.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In my opinion I think it's best to have multiple people give you opinions if you're having a difficult time finding a way to make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they have better, more, and smarter options to chose.

Having better options to chose is easier to make a good choice because it's from other peoples' perspective. When people ask me for advice I give them many options so they can think about it. It's also better to have multiple options so you can think what would happen before actually making a choice. If you don't like any options you thought about and don't know what's the best options, that's when its best to ask other people. I also think it's best to ask someone you are close with and that you trust.

Multiple opinions can be very helpful for some people. Maybe they have to make a choice that is really tough for them so they don't know what to do. If it's a choice that is really tough and important it's better to have a couple of people to help you but people you are comfortable with. Opinions they might give you are probably smarter then what you had thought about. It's never wrong to ask for help.

Although many people might disagree with my opinion, I think multiple opinions is very useful. In my perspective I would rather have many opinions from different people then having my own opinions because I would like to see what others think is best and this is why I think multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.              ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Student should able to do at least participate in one extracurricular activity in school is sports because they get to hang out with friends, get to know about each other, and get to do fun things. Some say that "" children needs to stay exercise everyday of their life""

They get to hang out with friends. Because they get talk with each other. Get more social with each others because in sports you get to play and win competition with your friends. This is important because you get to know how to get more social in the future.

Get to know more about each other. Because they need to know with they are playing, and how is their mood to talk with other persons. To getting to with each other is a great idea of doing an activity in school. This important when you get to do in a activity in school you have to know each other.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But the good option for students is to attend at school because if they take the option to attend school online classes at home. students will not benefit from online classes, students will just spent time on video games, and students will not be successful.

The first reason is that students will not benefit from online classes because it is not the same when they attend at school. Student can learn more there, in other words students pay attention to teachers. For example, in my case I can not learn more in online classes at my home because when I open the computer to do the class work or activities, I just get stress and I do not focus on them because there is no teacher who can tell me to pay attention. And because it is not the same when I am attend at school classes. In school I learn more things because when I do not understand something I ask for help to my teachers. I can say that I benefit more there than attending to school online classes at my home and also students can get more benefit by attending at school.

The second reason is that students will just spend time on video games instead of doing their class work or activities of school online class. For example, when I open my computer the first thing I like to do: is watch video games, play games, or watch movies like Disney. For these reasons I spent a lot of my time there, it is something difficult to me to focus on the online classes. Do online classes is hard for students because there are things that can distract students and they will not focus to learn or to the activities. They will just spend time on other things, as a result they will not be prepared for the next level of learning. Attending to school is something different because school has rules for students and teachers who can teach us personally, there is no excuse to learn, and there is no thing that can distract us from class work because teachers will be there watching us if we do our class work or activities.

Additionally, some people says that students will be more success by attending school online classes because they think technology has more advances in the word and that can help students to find answers to respond the questions and they can learn more. However they are incorrect, because in this case they considerate students less intelligent. Students can be successful by attending at school and not by attending online classes at home. As a students we can learn more at school classes, our teacher will always advise us to study to get a great grade and also they advise us to read books because there are lessons that can teach us: about life, about failure, and about success and that make students more smart. On that way we will progress on our life to achieve our goals.

In conclusion, it is better to attend at school because students will be prepared for the exterior world. If students attend to school online classes at home they will not have the desire to learn or to study. They can think "" there is no teacher who can tell us to do our class work so we can go outside with our friend.""

It is the sad reality and I am the first one who ca do the same. That the reasons that students can not benefit from online classes, students will just spend time on video games, and they will not be successful. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principal,

I think your idea about community service is great. Most children need tutors or help with homework. So if you don't mind i have some ideas on how to help our community succeed. For example i think putting straight A+ students with kids who need help with homework or if they need tutors would be one major step in our community becoming even greater. My next thought would be making our streets cleaner, some of these slackers in the school need to do work so having them clean would be a great idea. My last thought would be to put athletic kids to work making sure our communities people stay fit and healthy, maybe setting up athletic projects around campus would help?

So i have proposed ways to help our community. I know they all sound terrific but just make sure you to give kids time off. So here comes my next thought, community service is great i am with it but us kids need time off because trust me, were are not super humans. To add on to it we need time off community service, two or three times a week sounds good. All of us have chores around the house so if somebody can't make it you cannot get mad all they have to do is call in. On top of it some people have family to visit, sports to do, and need free time to hang out with friends.

Now ill tell you why i think wee need community service. First of all i think so many people are lazy and just sit around all day doing nothing. Next thing is that so many people just through trash all over the place and never in a trash bin. And my last thing is that so many kids are not getting the education they need its terrible. I think we should to have more people helping kids become smart young people than being idiotic in school sincerely, a caring student",0,persuade_corpus,3
"There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is?

The face is a very mysterious thing. It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also they might not belive in aliens.

There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face. So they start to think what could have created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.

People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.

On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. But on April 8, 2001 he set out for another picture. They took an extrodinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform. So therefore the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.

In conclusion people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landorm because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In the story "" The challenge of exploring venus""

the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit. venus its proved to be the most challenging place to examine. In paragrah 1 they said that ""venus is the second planet from the sun"", which makes it harder to see up close .venus is one of the plants that that havent been search yet sp that whats make venus one of the plants that need to be search and worthy to do so. In my opinion i think they should study venus more because its a lot of thiings they can discover and they can know more about the planet. Venus in my words is a more secretive plant because no one has ever successfully sent a spacecraft up to venus and it came back. In paragraph 2 it said that ""venus has a reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study"", which means that venus is still left unknown and has no research on venus. Another fact about venus is that it is the mist earth like planet in our solar system. In conclusion, i think that venus is so special because we dont really know too much about venus as we do to the other plants that's why it makes venus so important and worthy to figure out because we dont have too much proven facts about it.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"We run our elections by a process called Electoral College. This process consists of tje selction of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Electoral College consists or 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoal votes is required to elect the President.

There also is another process which is the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. We could change to popular vote but why would we change how we run the election if this is how we have been doing it for years. Also there are many other reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. Such as certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, Big states,and also avoid run-off elections.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoal Collge vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canidates share of the Electoal College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highley unlikly. Also the Eletoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a priesident.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politial balance that large states ( by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution. The winner take all method of awarding electoal votes induces the canidates. Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay more attentionto the campaign to really listen to the competing canidates, knowing tjat they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters.

It can be argued that the prsident may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. I believe that we should not change our electorial process to popular vote and i think we should stick with the process we have now ; Elecoral College. I listed my resonas why but the main reason is that everyone is so used to the Electoral College process because we have been doing it for years so to change it, it might confuse everyone and actual make the elections even more difficult and it might end up messing up our election and cause an unfair vote.             ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The face look alike that was on Mars was not created by aliens. Many people may believe that but they might just want to belive that there are such things as aliens. The face was created by just landforms. Reasonings being is, MOC, or Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture, the NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get such an accurate photo, and people over the interent were making their own stories up to make it seem like there was an alien that made that.

MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the face like rock. When they took a picture that was alot more accurate and sharper looking than what Viking's had taken, they were able to zoom in and look at more then just the face. The passage says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all."" Which, since they ARE scientist, they have done their research on the picture and done as much looking into as they possibly could have.

NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get an accurate photo. In the article it says, ""... Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" So, when the Viking's took the picture and the shadow was in it, it made it look something more than what the MOC had caught. The Viking's had no profesional camera to take that picture of the landform. Also, they were far away from the planet, they were circling it, so the shadow that they were seeing had to of been from something else. Or maybe from what they were even in.

People over the internet were making their own stories up. In the article it states, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" Since people believe whatever they see on the interent, they had to of jumped to conclusions and people had to of been throwing out the idea of ""Oh! that has got to be made by an alien!"" so that's what people starting saying. The NASA reveiled th photo hoping it would bring attention to Mars, but that is sure what they got. But it was the atention that an alien had made the landform.

So, with that being said, MOC had actual camera photage of the landform, NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get accurate pictures, and people over the internet were just trying to make it seem like an alien was real. That proves that the face was just a natural landform.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Should driverless cars be allowed.?They should not be allowed because you can get really hurt, More time on repair,More accidents. These reasons support why I think that driverless cars should not be allowed. Should driverless cars be allowed, No because you can get really hurt. that topic supports why i think driverless cars should not be allowed because if you cant control what is going on then how do you think that you can avoid accidents or say someone is not paying attention and they pull out in front of you and you cant just slam on the breaks you have to wait for a sensor to be tricked so that way your car will stop this will lead to more accidents and or more deaths. This reason supports why i think that driverless cars should not be allowed. Furhter, driverless cars should not be allowed becuse they will cost more to repair. I say that because say you are driving down the road and something in the engine goes out and it causes you to be on the side of the road stranded. your gonna have to pay for a tow truck. also when you go in to get the car cheecked out and the part that blew out was something that they dont have in stores so you have to get it shipped which is already taking two to three business days to get here so your gonna be with out a car until then so your gonna have to rent a car which costs a fourtion,or the part that you need is brand new so its gonna be really expensive. Then you have to pay for someone to put the part in for you because since this is a driverless car and the techonology is new your not gonna know what goes were. these reason support why i think driverless cars should not be allowed. Lastly, do you think driverless cars should be allowed?. No, because there will be more accidents. I say that because a driverless car means that the person in the driver seat can not control the car in any way. so if you get to going fast and then your mom or dad calls or textes you and you have to look down and then when you look down a car cuts you off and gets in your lane then causes you to flip your car and or die. These reason support why i think that driverless cars should not be alowed.

"The advantages of limited car usage is critical in source 1, Vauban, Germany a place where most of the streets are ""car-free"". In this place car ownership is allowed, but their are only about one or two places to park, which are garages at the end of each development. Limiting car usage has its advantages, the United States has up to 50 percent of greenhouse emissions in some car-intensive areas. Stores are usually placed in malls along some distant highway. The new approach made it so that stores are placed a walk away, you wont have to use more money for gas.

"Mr. Senator election by popular vote is the way to go, let the people decide!  It's their choice to pick who runs the U.S.A. this is the choice of who they want to run the country.  The citizens should have a right to vote for who they really want.  Instead of having a couple hundred people I think we should have all the people in the country choose.  So why dont we?  We can establish this rule and make it right let the citizens of the U.S.A. pick who the president should be!

Electoral collage  as the office of Federal Register in quote ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting og the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President"".  It's a bad idea to me when you can just make everyone vote for who they want not who just a couple hundred people want.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors which a certain amount need to vote as 270 is the precise number is required.  Each candidate running each has a group of electors, they are originally chosen by the candidates politicial party.  The choice where the people choose and vote is way easier than that, we have a choice for what we want.

The ""Indefensible Electoral College"" is wrong your voting for the electors as it says in paragraph 10.  Bradford Plumer says as I quote ""Under the electoral college sysetem voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President.  There for we are voting for the electors right?  So whats the whole point when we can stick to our ways and vot ourselves.  This makes it way more simple and faster, better than waiting through the system for other people to vote, when you can just do it yourself.

Theres no reason for each party to select a slate of electors.  It can be argued that this system can turn off potential voters as a candidate.  There are 5 reasons for retaining this system.  Those are certainty of outcome, everyone's President, swing States, Big states, and avoid run-off elections.  Still we need to be able to make our own decisions.  We don't need other people to make them for us.

These people in the U.S.A. are determined in what they want, not what other people want.  They want to choose what they believe they don't want to go through a long system. When you can just do it yourself its easier, because you know what your doing but if you go the other way you have to teach the people your working with.  When you have the whole Country voting it makes it more simple and easy to go through the process.  So let the people choose who they really want as the President of the U.S.A. dont leave it to other people to do it for them.

Lastly, it can change your own point of view from hearing other peoples opinion. All in all, asking multiple people for advice can help benefit your decision.

One reason to ask multiple people for advice is that you can hear different point of views. Hearing different point of views is always good to have in any situation.

"As a young girl summer projects had always taunted me. I've always hated that the summer projects were so hard that I can only answer 2 questions out of the 50 question packet. These packets made me feel like I wasn't smart enough , even though they were there to help me. And the fact that if I were to complete the packet teachers wouldn't ask for it and that bugged me so much. Although some may believe otherwise struggling students , My friend's experience , and my own experience proves that summer projects should be student-designed.

Struggling students proves that summer projects should be student-designed. Summer projects are here to help us and keep us learning .When a student struggles in that subject area where the project was given these students would struggle and then become discouraged to continue making them feel small. Student-designed summer projects would target the areas they struggle in to help them succeed. Some people may say that these type of students will still struggle with or without student-designed work . In some cases this may be the case but student designed work will target trouble factors but teacher-designed will through a whole curriculum at you.

My friend's experience also proves that student-designed projects are the way to go. In the summer of 2019 my friend Generic_Name was given an Algebra 2 summer project packet to complete. Knowing that math isn't her strong suit she still attempted the summer assignment. As she went along the packet the questions were getting harder and harder for her to complete. She had never seen questions like this before so she got discouraged. Out of 100 math questions she only completed 10. She was beaten. How was she as a junior to remember the math curriculum from freshman year. So she tried to use online resources to help her but she still couldn't understand. The packet was never completed. Some people may say she shouldv'e gotten a tutor, but not a lot of people can afford a tutor to help them.

Lastly my own experience is why summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. As I said earlier teacher-designed packets made me feel like I wasn't smart enough and that they so hard that I can answer only 2 questions out of the 50 question packet. Teacher-designed packets are meant to introduce you to the curriculum for the upcoming year for that subject area. So that means harder problems. But student-designed packets are targeting problems areas and are helpful and designed to the student personally which means more understanding and helpful. Most of the time content that is understanding and shaped for that specific student's learning is what is best for them. I know that if a curriculum was shaped for me and how I learn I would understand that subject way better. Some people may say that its too much work to shape a curriculum based off how the student learns and that the student would need to learn to adapt to it .But if you were to do that grades and testing scores would rise because students are doing better.

This is really important. Adapting the way students learn could possibly change ones future. In the past learning was state designed. They thought they knew the most effective way of a students way of learning but ended up hurting us. Student-designed summer assignments will help us grow in our education and succeed. We can start taking action now. Teachers can be more understanding and states should lookk to students to see how they could change the learning that fits to their students.

"Have you ever really wanted something but you didn't know if you should get it.

It might be expensive, or it could just take up a lot of space.

Sometimes we only ask one person, and when doing this, we are making a huge mistake.

When you ask only one person, you are more prone to getting a bias opinion.

When someone has bias, it means that they are in favor of a something without any factual reason.

You think that people you know are not bias, but you probably believe the bias yourself.

If you have multiple opinions on the other hand, you are more likely to hear different viewpoints, which can help you make your decision.

An example of seeking multiple opinions is when I bought a fishing rod.

It's a very nice rod, and at the time this rod would subtract all of my Christmas money.

I had no idea whether I should get the rod, but what I did next helped me decide whether I would waste all my money, or if it would be money well spent.

I asked my Mother, who was with me at the store.

She thought that I would be wasting all my money, but she recommended that I speak with my Father.

I did what she asked, and lucky for me, he not only answered, but his friends were there with him.

They all gave me advice, and at the end said that it was a good deal.

I now had to consider myself why I should, and why I shouldn't buy the rod.

At the end, I decided to buy the rod, but it would have not been without the help of multiple people and their opinions.

Now you understand why multiple opinions help people make good decisions.

Multiple opinions help prevent one way thinking.

I hope that with the knowledge that you now know, you can go out and before you buy that cool new phone, ask multiple people who have the knowledge of that product.

Finally, never let one person help choose what you get.

"New technologies are created everyday. A new technology that was recently created is one that is called the Facial Action Coding System. This system enables computers to identify human emotions. This system itself can be very valuable to read the expressions of students in a classroom.

This resource can be very useful to teachers as well as students. This system will be essential to teachers when it comes to online assignments or practice games. As stated in the article "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" "" Then it could motify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" That would then make the teachers job easier because if they are bored or aren't understanding the topic the system will read that and change up the lesson a bit. The students will also benefit from this because it makes learning fun and easier to understand. The easier it is to comprehend something the better a student will do in school.

The Facial Action Coding System would be a great asset to the student classroom. It makes school run smoother and easier for the staff and students. This new technology will help not only the education department but many others as well.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear senator in the sources ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defences of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer  and also ""In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, the authors of the article discuss the pros and cons to having an electoral college. The citizens of the United States would be more pleased if the electoral college stayed as opposed to it being ebolished.

To begin, having a electoral college will be better for the nation and people.

for example, the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president"" the article states ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is very possible- it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" this claim provides a true statement on reasons why we should keep the electoral college. This statement means that disputes are less likely with their method and their is a certainty of an outcome.

Although keeping the electoral college is a valid idea, there are some problems associated with keeping the electoral college as well. Of course, there are difficulties with in the curcumstsance where we keep the Electoral Collage opposed to disspose of it. the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Plumer made several claims opposing of the electoralcollege, such claims include ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"" and opinons like ""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irration"". While Plumer did put his point across as to how the system is unfair we must take into consideration how it is more reasonable and appropriate, in ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" the article states that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" which is fair and less stressful.

in summary, the best option would to keep the way things are rather than changing things up and and creating a more stressful, unorganized system. Although Plumer made accurate claims as to some of the faults in the system, there was far more proof in keeping the electoral college and keeping things the same.                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore""? As said in the being of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the question is simple. I can say without a doubt that I can invision diverless cares in the future. Although I can hope for sooner rather than later that is one aspect I can not yet answer.

As I have already stated in the previous paragraph that I can invision this future, but I also support this future. The era of perfectly calculating autonomous cars would be an era of complete safety on roads. The driverless cars not being subjected to human errors would not make the foolish mistakes that a human might make in situations like slick roads, alcoholic influence, and peer preasure. The only flaw with autonomous car that I can visualize is the possible glitches in it's programing that could be prevented with annual mantainance. As said in the article ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"" Although I do not see a public transport system being the only use of these cars I can agree with the amount of options and the decrease of polution put into our daily life styles.

In the end I fully agree with the use of driverless cars no matter what the primary use is for. With only minimum tolerance for errors in todays technology I do not see the likelyhood of an accident due to the fualt of the car. Although, as the article states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault"". I refute this statement just as the article did it's self by saying ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved"".",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Have you ever come back to school after a long summer break and forgot everything you previously learned? Than you probably had an easy summer project if you had one at all. Many teachers let their students off easy for summer thinking they need a break, but what they are really doing is setting them up for failure for the following year. Although some may believe otherwise student preparedness, teacher support, and students using previously learned information prove that teacher should design summer projects.

If a teacher designs a summer assignment it will most likely introduce students to things they will learn the next year. This will provide students with an opportunity to be ahead at the start of the following year and make it easier for teachers too. Teachers would not have to spend as much time teaching the students things they already learned, they can just review it and go onto harder material. This will also give students a base for the start of the following year and they will already know what to expect. Some people believe that students should have a break during the summer although I agree, you are going to have to do an assignment even if it is made by students or the teacher, so why not get a head start on the next year. This will also allow students to pull from knowledge they already have.

A good summer assignment will allow students to use what they learned the previous year. If a student is able to use what they already learned their is a much higher chance that they wont forget it. One of the worst feelings in school is when the teacher is reviewing things you need to know from the previous year and you forgot most if not all of it. Why would you want to take a class for a year and not retain the information you need to know. Doing an assignment in the summer, even if it does not pertain to the information you learned will keep your brain active and give you a better chance of remembering what you learned. Some people would say that if a student really learned the information in school than they do not need a summer assignment, But many students do not learn everything to the extent that they need to to be able to remember it the next year. One of the main reasons students dont complete summer projects is because they cant. If the students create the assignment than the teacher can not help.

If a teacher creates a summer assignment than they can give the students videos or websites that can help them. This can support the student since there will be no teacher present to help them. If students create the project than the teacher will not be able to help them at all. If students create the project some students may believe the project that they created is easy, but it is difficult for some students to learn without the support of a teacher or video. Teachers creating the assignment will make it so they can complete their project in a timely manner and still enjoy summer. Some people would say that students should have easy summer assignments that dont require assistance but this is proven wrong every year by students who do not remember previous information.

Many students do not do the summer assignment assigned to them or cram it all to the last minute because it is normally just busy work. If summer projects were assigned by teachers than they would most likely be work to help you with the upcoming year and help you remember. If this was the case than most productive students would realize the value of them and work on them in a timely manner. If students did their part by completing the assignment and teachers gave out assignments that help summer projects will no longer be looked at as busy work but as a tool to recall information and give you a head start. If students created the assignment than it would continue being looked at as busy work and a waste of time.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting all dangers by making it seem like a challenge and having interesting facts about what kind of planet it is. The author starts it off by referring to Venus as "" Earth's twin "".

In the artcle it states,""often referred to as Earth's "" twin "", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 2). This explains how they start to talk about Venus being interesting. Then the author starts talking abut how Venus is a difficult planet for humans to study and details about it. Sometimes, us as humans like challenges and they like to test their limit to see how far they can go. In the article it states,""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging plnet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 2).

This explains that they see it as a challenge. Another reason that the author supports the claim is they start stating unusual facts about Venus despite the circumstances. In the text it states,""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 3). This explains that they draw in more attention stating unusual facts. The author also talks about how professionals like astronomers find it interesting. In the text it states,""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our system.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 4). This explains why people who go up into space see it as a fascinating thing.

The author makes it seem like Venus is our closest option to visit for space travel. The author tries to infrom us that studying Venus is a good thing by looking at it as meeting our curiousities and as us getting insight on what it really is. In the text it states,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavours.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 8). This explains how they appeal to this as gaining insight on the planet and seeing it as a challenge.

"In 2002, a study showed that only 23% of Americans asked more than one person when seeking advice. However, asking more than one person for advice may get you different answers because people have gone through different experiences. They most likely had different outcomes, some good and others bad. Asking multiple people for their opinions can improve your knowledge because people have gone through different experiences, the elderly has lived through history, and even if people aren't there your peers post blogs and websites online.

To begin with, everyone lives their own life and makes their own decisions; therefore, they go through different journeys and down different paths. When I was little, my mother told me a story her parents told her when she was my age. It started out with my grandma, Generic_Name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. She needed advice. My grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. Initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went well when she went through the same experience. Next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. Her next choice was to talk to her best friend, Generic_Name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet Generic_Name still gave her advice. Generic_Name was thankful she had asked three people because she received three different outcomes.

Additionally, an author once said, ""Treat your elders with respect as they are older and wiser."" The elderly has gone through going to school but while that happened and they were growing up they also lived through wars, poverty, some may have kids or even grandkids, and over the past about twenty or so years new ages/generations, and the upbringing of technology. The author mentioned ""wiser"", they have lived through so much and they were always learning something new. Therefore, they know a lot and can be another option for giving advice.

Lastly, whether the decision you have to make is life changing or a small choice there is always someone or something that can help. About two years ago my best friend, Generic_Name, called me and told me to come over as soon as I could. Not knowing what any of this was about, I rushed over there and she said she needed to talk. I listened while she told me this sad story about Generic_Name, her sixteen year old cousin, who was now pregnant. She continued to talk and asked me what I thought. I was speechless knowing that her cousin was thinking about getting an abortion. Generic_Name said that Generic_Name's parents and grandparents passed away in a car accident two months ago and Generic_Name was angry at the world so she went to a college party, had too much to drink, and met a guy. A month later, she found out she was pregnant and did not have anyone to talk to. She spent the next month looking up ""How to take care of a baby"", ""Abortion"", ""Teen Pregnancy"", and a lot of other things before she had talked to Generic_Name and asked for advice. Generic_Name had gotten some advice from blogs and websites online but she also wanted to talk to Generic_Name before she made a decision, but Generic_Name didn't know what to do, so she called me. The next week, we went to lunch with Generic_Name and had a long discussion. We didn't force her into or out of anything; although, we did give her our opinions. As we were leaving, Generic_Name mentioned that she was thankful that she looked up blogs and websites online and that she was able to talk to us. No matter how big or small the choice, someone is always there.

In conclusion, when you ask more than one person for advice it can better your understanding because people have had different outcomes with similar experiences, your elders are wiser and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online. Your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to support you and help give advice. No matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to help. Before making a life changing choice or decision ask multiple people for advice.         ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Do you really want to spend your day crammed in your house being bored and doing nothing? Well I don't. And because of that I believe that all students should participate in sports. You might be thinking ""Why should I,"" well you should because you become healthy, it brings new opportunitys, and a better mental health.

Sports can help you become healthy. One way you can become healthy is that you're constanly excersicing. You are running, lifting weights, stretching, and more. Another way is that you're outside. If you're outside it's better for you because you need sunlight and fresh air. The last way is that you're given a new group. It's healthy to be around different people then just school friends. If you can't find a way to be active well then try a sport because there are many sports to choose from.

You are given new opportunities through sports. What I mean by that is you can be given scholarships. If you end up being really good at a sport then you could try to get a scholarship for college. A second way you're given a new opportunity is new friends. Since you're surrounded by kids your age 2-3 times a week might as well become friends with them. Lastly, you're in a new enviorment which is good. It can be a nice change from your usual schedule. We all need new opportunities sometimes and it can't hurt to try them.

Your mental health can improve from doing sports. The first way mental health can improve is by running. When you're running your stress and anxiety goes away because you have a break from it. You can be put in a better mood. Studies show that being active improves your mood. The last way your mental health can improve is you get a better sleep. If you've been active all day then you're most likely going to be tired when you get home which can help you get a better sleep for school the next day. If you still think that sports sound boring then think about you and how you can improve as a person and fix your mental health through this.

In conclusion I believe that all students should participate in sports. You can become healthy and fit so you're ready for bikini season. Change is good so put yourself out there and do a sport it can't hurt to try. Become a better version of yourself and improve your mental health. For all these reasons I've given I believe kids should participate in sports.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear principal,

You are honestly considering making every student participate in community service? I do not think you should require us to. Let me explain then you decide.

For my first reason it will be too much of a hassle for you and the rest of the staff. Parents will call and complain about their child not wanting to do it. How would students get to the sites after cleaning up close to school? You will have to pay bus drivers to take the students to the site. Depending on how big the school is you may need a couple busses with all the money going to this we could had got new text books or something to benefit our learning.

Less students will enroll in our school or some may drop out. We are at school to learn, not to pick up trash other people threw out. If students do not want to do not make them, it defeats the purpose. They already have a system that does that it is called a chain gang. They broke the law we did nothing wrong so why should we have to do it? How are you going to make sure students do not ditch you can only punish them later.

I believe it will be a great mistake and cost our school money we could be using to make our school a safer learning environment. So if you do not want to cost us everything then do not make us do it. Thank you for taking time to read this, and please respond soon.

Sincerely your student,

"People often wonder when the world is going to end; will humans need a new place to live? Scientists have been researching alternatives to living on earth, such as living on mars or venus. Both planets would need some modifications before humans would be able to take residence but both planets are possible alternatives for when earth decides to die. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains some of the difficulties scientists have to deal with when trying to explore venus. The author of this article shows his readers that by using maybe older technology mixed with newer thinking the scientists at NASA might be able to penetrate Venus' surface long enough to get the samples they need and in return protect the lives of their astronauts.

Scientists at NASA have been trying to figure out how to penetrate the atmosphere of Venus without losing any lives. They have come up with ideas like sending astronauts about 30 miles above venus to get some samples, the only problem being that getting samples would be next to impossible (pararaph 5). The reason for this being is that the men simply can reach down to the surface becuase the temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the high pressure is enough to crush a submarine into a dime (paragraph 3) Not only that but the weather on the surface is absolutley horrendus, presenting errupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightening strikes (paragraph 3). These lightening strike have proven a problem for probes sent up to the surface of venus becuase they just get shocked and are no longer of use.

Luckily for our dying planet though, NASA is working on creating a simple and sturdy machine to go up and collect samples, the last one they tested lasted up to three weeks in their simulaiton of Venus (paragraph 7). Another way they are modifying these machines is by using older technology becuase it does not require electronics, and without the electronics you get out the risk of lightening destroying the million dollar toy (paragraph 7). A good thing about using mechanical parts versus electronic parts is that mechanical parts are said to be, ""more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" (paragraph 7).

By using mechanical machines NASA can ensure the safety of the astronauts and get the samples they need to discover is Venus is in fact, a habitable plantet. The author shows this by explaining how using austronauts simply is not enough and that by combining older technology and newer thinking that scientists at NASA can penetrate Venus' serface and discover if it is habitable. If NASA combines their thinking with the older, and sturdier technology the advencements they could make would be tremendous. They could discover is Venus is habitable and possibly be able to modify it they way they need to so venus can become habitable. If the process does not work with venus they could use their research on mars or possiby other planets in the solar system. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I am against driverless cars because of many reasons. One reason i""m against driverless cars because in paragraph 9 it talks about what if there was an accident who would be the fault the manufactur or the driver. I think the manufacturer should be the fault because its not the perosn using the product its the person who build it. They relied on them so they should be hela accountable for the situation. Then it says in paragraph 7 they are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. then turns around and says some manufacturers hope that they can install entertainment in the car for the driver. I believe that if they are geting entertained in the car how would they focus on the road. Also it says such displays can be turned off instantly. Just because it can doesnt mean it will.

I Would like to have computers like that becasue I would love to know my emotions everyday. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would like to know every now and then. So, the computers are going to tell you what your emotions are and tell you the percent to how happy you are, or how disgusted, fearful, angry, and many more. The computers can calculate anyones emotion whenever they would like to know.

The computers are there for people when they want to know there emotions. Like when they are having a bad day and they want to see how sad they are. All they have to do is go to the computer to find out. If I had that computer I would most deffinetly go to it.

But since I don't have it I just figure it out on my own by just relaxing and minding my own business.

Whoever came up with the human emotion computer is very smart becasue you know how many people would go to that computer to see how upset or how angry they are.

"Dear Principal,

I would like to share with you my position on community service, and suggest for it to be a mandatory assignment.

First of all, community service requires people to take time out of their schedule, and benefit something. If we are required to do this, this would teach that anything 'important' you might have planned, probably is not as important as bettering a community. It teaches good values to students, and at this age, good values and opinions are important for a kid to grow up with. Because in later life as adults, we will either be thankful for this, or regret not having this opportunity.

Right now, community service isn't required. And most students won't go out of their way to do something for others if they don't have to do it. Some students don't like to try new things. If they have to try community service, who knows, they might enjoy it. Of course, there will always be students who won't. But the few more students will make a difference, big or small, the better. Maybe they will continue doing community service throughout there life. The more people willing to tutor a kid, feed the homeless or pick up trash, the better the community.

Lastly, teens these days are very ignorant. Most spend all their time on the TV, on the computer or playing video games. They aren't exposed to much, so they assume many things about the dying forests, dirty beaches and the communities in need. Especially with how some parents might raise their kids, students won't know how it feels on the other side. Helping out a needy community will expose them to the needy, the ghetto, and nature in need of help. Requiring community service will teach students about these things, and know how much help they need. Requiring community service will not only benefit the needy community, but benefit the students as well.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The Face is an actual landform, it was not created by aliens. In order for me to prove this to you I need facts, so that it is what the majority of this essay is going to be about. I will also be be telling you how I know that the Face on Mars is a landform. There are many facts as to why the Face on Mars is a landform and I will be sharing all of those that I can find with you.

I will also be telling some other landforms that are similar to the Face. I am citing all of my evidence and facts from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

One of my first claims that the Face on Mars is actually a landform and was not created by aliens is from paragraph three in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and it states, ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

At the beginning of that sentence it says ""a huge ROCK formation"" which is telling us that it is actually rock and that it had devolped over time to form into the shape of a face. And that it was not created by aliens because aliens can not create or make rocks.

Another claim that the face is actually a land form and was not created by aliens is that in paragraph twelve is it giving us a very clear and precise meaning that the Face is an landform by telling us that, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That is telling us that there are more places in the world that are like the Face on Mars. That also means that if there are more places, then aliens could not have made the Face on Mars because that means it would have had to make all of the other mesas and buttes in the entire universe.

Lastly, my final claim that the face is actually a landform and was not created by aliens is in paragraph seven in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and that it tells us that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tem times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" At the end of that whole paragraph it tells us that there was no alien monument after all. Which means that the aliens did not create the Face on Mars at all.

In conclusion I know that the Face on Mars is actually a landform and was not created by aliens because of the facts the a have cited from the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". I have given you very good claims as to why and I really hope that you change your opinion on this topic of matter. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Today, technology is advanced enough to create cars that are semi-driverless.

However, humans demand more.

People want driverless cars for maximum efficiency.

However, letting cars drive for themselves is dangerous and the development of driverless cars should be halted.

Robots are quite common today.

Semi-driverless cars are no exception.

However, if a car was to become fully driverless, it would be considered a robot.

The artificial intelligence operating the car would be like a brain, making decisions about where to turn and how fast it needed to go.

On the surface this seems practical.

No more drivers would be needed, and robots are more coordinated so driving would become a lot safer.

This is not true.

Infact, if drivers were to dissappear due to the appearance of driverless cars, there would be even more problems than today.

According to the three laws of robotics, robots are not allowed to harm or kill humans.

Because fully independent artificial intelligence have not yet been developed, this law has not come into play yet.

If an automatic car was to be developed, then the law would act upon and restrain the robot operating the vehicle.

For example, if a robot driven car was to crash and kill people in the car, the law would be broken.

In paragraph 9, the author discusses how if technology fails, both the driver and manufacturer would be to blame.

Now with the driver being the robot, more complications would arise, proving that independent cars are dangerous.

Danger also comes from another place, being other people.

The robot can prove to be safer, being immune to distractions taking place in the passenger seats.

Without a human driver, the car is able to be controlled from the outside.

If a hacker were to take control of a robot operated car, the passengers inside would fall victim to the hacker.

Computer development has shown to be advanced enough for a hacker to easily get access to the movement of a car, including locks, breaks, steering, acceleration, and pretty much anything that the robot would be controlling.

This danger is already a threat to society today.

Smart cars can be hacked due to them relying on GPS and other wirelessly connected sources.

100% human dependent cars cannot be hacked due to the vehicle being disconnected to outside sources and dangers.

The final major danger with cars being independent is that despite being an automatic system, its reaction speed is too slow.

In paragraph 4, LIDAR is explained as a rotating sensor on the roof that uses laser technology to generate 3-D models of the car's surroundings.

This is all assuming that everything is stationary or slower paced.

If an animal were to suddenly jump in front of the car, or if a pedestrian was to trip and fall infront of the car, it would crush the obstacle.

Despite being an intelligent piece of equipment, the car's sensors would not be fast enough to calculate the sudden appearance of an obstacle.

The car's artificial intelligence would need to gather, process and use the data all in a split second.

This is also assuming that the brakes work well enough and can stop the speeding car in time.

Whoever or whatever was on the street would be crushed before the car had enough time to stop itself.

This also goes back to the danger of driverless cars killing people, except this time it is a danger to the car's surroundings.

Legal issues woud arise, and the robot would take the blame.

However people have the tendency to hurt other humans so the manufacturers would be blamed for not having a better sensor.

The development of newer sensors and faster computers would increase the cost of the driverless cars and decrease its practicality.

Driverless cars would create many issues and potentially be the number one leading cause of death in developed countries.

These three points are just some of the dangers of driverless cars.

The development of this kind of technology is practical but risky.

However the development of new automobile and transportation technology will not yield to its dangers.

People are willing to sacrifice and explore dangerous things if the outcome is tempting enough.

Advancements and changes will take place, and soon driverless cars will take to the roads.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear principal this new policy that you have made is not right. some of our best athletes have a C average so by making the eligible grades higher to a B average you will be destroying our sports program. If you chose to fallow your policy then the whole sport program and all the school are going on a strike. We the students will stop making good grades.

By dropping our grades than we will make the school look bad. you will be the one affected because you are the one incharged of the students doing good and not dropping their grades. After dropping our grades you still decide to fallow your policy then we will slowly stop coming to school. We will all transfer out of the school and attend another school that has a sport C eligible program. Also if there is a low number of students that are coming to the school than the school board will have to shut the school down. After the school shuts down then you will have to lose your job. After you lose your job the students will beg the school board to reopen the school just with a different principal that is under a condition of not l higher the eligible average.

So that as long as your passing all your classes with at least C average then you can be participating in any sport you feel like playing.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Currently, there aren't many kids doing extracurricular activities inside or outside of school.

I believe that this is not a good thing, considering that extracurricular activities have many benefits that could help students excel academically.

A large number of these students do not know what great effects these activities could have, so they don't participate in them.

Recently, my principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I agree with her decision to make these activities mandatory for multiple reasons. Extracurricular activities allow kids to socialize with others, give more opportunities to discover new talents, and help kids improve their critical thinking and physical abilities.

Extracurricular activities allow kids to socialize with each other.

Most extracurricular activities involve discussing ideas and plans with each other.

This gives kids way more opportunities to make new friends.

Making students socialize can easily spark new friendships, which is a great positive change.

Furthermore, participating in activities that students like allows them to meet people with similar interests.

This makes kids feel more supported and not as alone in an activity that they actually enjoy.

Finding kids who enjoy the same things as they do can improve their confidence and self-esteem.

Finally, more socializing opportunities bring more teamwork opportunities. All of these activities, whether it's soccer or yearbook club, involve working together and being apart of a team. Teamwork is a very important skill that is necessary in succeeding in life.

Knowing how to work together is crucial, and starting at a young age is a beneficial way to improve this skill.

Students can also learn how to help each other in skills that need improvement, and they can give others more confidence and support.

Being supportive is a good trait that all students should have.

Giving kids more opportunities to socialize with each other is so important and beneficial, and this new decision is the perfect opportunity.

This new decision also gives students more opportunities to discover new talents or learn new things.

Encouraging kids to experiment with new activities and go out of their comfort zones can help them find something that they really enjoy.

There is a wide variety of activities for students to choose from, and one of these activities could help someone find their passion.

It is so important for kids to find an activity that they're passionate about, and they may even end up turning it into a career.

Every school's goal should be to educate children and give them the skills that they need to be successful, and making extracurricular activities mandatory certainly drives the path towards that goal.

Participating in new activities could also teach students skills that can help them become successful.

Learning how to paint, dribble a basketball, and photograph may seem like small, unimportant skills, but they could eventually turn into something big.

Lastly, participating in extracurricular activities can help students find something that they're good at.

People who have struggled in finding talents and skills now have more opportunities to do so.

A lot of students might not feel special or talented, but they could finally find something that they're good at.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory for students could open up many doors.

Extracurricular activities help students improve their critical thinking and physical abilities.

No matter what extracurricular activity, they allow kids to use their creative minds more often.

Making students' critical thinking abilities stronger could have so many benefits.

Kids would likely improve their grades and think in a more creative way.

Their imaginations would become so much more powerful, and this would positively impact them.

Also, participating in physical activities like sports has many positive outcomes.

Participating in a sport would really enhance these students' physical abilities.

Encouraging exercise would allow kids to stay in shape and become more fit, and being good at a sport also has many benefits.

Students could join sports teams and play a sport in high school or college.

Extracurricular activities teach kids how to solve problems differently.

It is very beneficial to help kids think outside the box, as this would really help them in the future.

Teaching kids how to think creatively and differently makes them stand out from each other.

The improvement of these abilities is just another positive outcome of making extracurricular activities mandatory.

I agree with my principal's decision to make participation in at least one extracurricular activity mandatory for these reasons.

Extracurricular activities give students more socializing opportunities, allow students to discover new talents or learn new skills, and help the improvement of their critical thinking and physical abilities.

This new decision could be the start of a lot of improvement.

I truly believe that making extracurricular activities mandatory would have a large, lasting impact on all students. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Many teachers assign summer projects to students to ensure that the child is still school focused throughout all the fun summer activities. Even though, majority of students hate the words ""summer and project"" together, giving them lead way to design their project is the best way to go. Students would have a chance to gain responsibility, be creative and make an easy grade.

Firstly, giving students the lead way to design their project allows the individual to gain responsibility. The student would be obligated to make time for all the steps leading up to the final project, making them move their schedule around or cancel plans. This ties into being an adult, making sacrifices to get important things done. For example, a students gets a summer project, its a Friday night and his or her friends wants them to go out. Instead of being behind on the project from going out, simply saying no and staying in to miss out on the fun is a sacrifice to the student. Therefore, creating responsibility from the ultimatum.

Secondly, letting students take lead way is the best option because it allows the student to actually be creative. Students get boring topics and assignments all the time, causing them to do poorly strictly because they dont find interest on the topic. However, giving students the free will design the project based on their interests while also being school related will definitely give a change in the result of the final project versus a random teacher designed project. For example, a teacher gives a random topic she designed to the student. The student gets a topic about plants, which the student knows nothing about while also having little to none interest about them. As a result, the student is not going to give their full potential on the project because they did not have interest on the forced topic.

Lastly, letting students design their summer project will give students the ability to bring their grade up. By students being creative and going the extra mile to have a successful project will give them the the perfect opportunity to make a great grade. For example, while doing the summer project the students will have confidence in the topic. While doing research the student will know exactly what they want to look for and even have a small plan on how they'd like the final outcome of the project to be. Resulting in a confident, well put together project.

However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be. However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer.

In result, when summer rolls around and summer projects are assigned, letting students get the opportunity to design their project gives them responsibility by making simple or grand decisions, an open door to the students creative limits, and also makes great pay off from all the hard work and dedication gone into the project. So next time a teacher assigns a boring topic, students should take the lead and make a astonishing grade.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively.

If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling. I would go onto a website that was used for teaching people from K-12th grade everything that they would need to know. I would do this from when I was taken out of school to the first year of middle school, and my knowledge and understanding of the subjects that we were learning was at the point were I wasn't the odd ball in the class. With that part of the year and during the summer when not only was I able to catch up in subjects that I was a few grades lower in, but I was a level higher then everyone else for a while.

With teachers designing the summer project then students don't have to worry about it as much because they don't have to waste the time deciding what to do for the project all summer. Not only would the students be given a benefit from using the knowledge given to them, but they also get to finish it in almost half the time that they would have needed if they were to choose the project as well. There are a lot of friends that I know who can't decide on a certain subject for a project until it is either the night before it is due or the day off. They are very stressed out when this happens which leads to them failing in other classes as the extra stress from that one class is distracting them from the others.

Another benefit is that the student actually has to go out of their comfort zone, or they will stay in it, if the subject or the needed information is in a subject/ topic they like or dislike. Forcing a student to work on something that they don't understand is something that could help them understand it, and as they have to get a understanding before they can use it or they will not understand it and never get any better on the subject; making the student more creative in their methods for learning and for when they overcome harder challenges in life. For Example, they might get into a rut at a job that they have and it is getting difficult to keep going. Well if they are creative thinkers then an idea might pop into their head which could lead to them getting out of the rut and to a much happier life.

In conclusion, then if a teacher either from the last year or the next year will be able to help the students understanding grow. Although, some people think that the teacher shouldn't be the one to design it, but in fact the student, because it gives them a free choice on what to do, they have more fun doing it as it might be a subject they are interested in, and they might be able to grow in their field of experiences that interests them. It still could lead to students not doing the summer project at all because they might not be able to decide until the very last moment or not at all. If a teacher or teachers design the summer project then their is a lower chance that the student will forget information from the last year. Along with, the project being a challenge that could benefit both the student and the future teachers in the long term, with the student having a better understanding of the subject and/or the concept.",0,persuade_corpus,2
Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME. I feel that students should perform community service because the world needs to become a better place. Everyday many birds and animals at sea die do to pollution and the garbage thrown in the water. People eat whatever it is their mom or dad packed for them and they throw that plastic in the water only causing another animal to suffocate and die crucially. Even if that piece of plastic was thrown on the floor do to all the wind it can end up right in the ocean. I feel that this whole community service is like a processed sequence because someone liters and another person picks it up and it goes on over and over and it doesn't help the earth as a whole. I know that if we can all come together and clean up this earth it will make it not only a better environment for the animals but for us humans. As more people see us clean up the world they will start to join. They should raise the price on littering to however much it takes to get this earth to a better and cleaner place. So in my eyes I believe that community service is appropriate in everyway possible. Now even though I believe students should do community service I also believe that adults should to because as mentioned earlier if everyone participates this will in deed make the world a better place.,0,persuade_corpus,1
"Should summer projects be student-designed? In my opinion, yes; I feel as though summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to express their creativity and have the freedom to think outside the box, rather than be held back of their ideas and inner thoughts. On the other hand, teachers also feel as though that they should be allowed to give specific project topics or ideas to their students, instead of students creatively thinking for themselves due to a lack of performance in the classroom. Though, teachers believe summer projects should be designed through their ideas due to poor performance in the classroom, students should be given a chance to express themselves and the freedom to create their own projects.

As a student, summer break is supposed to be a time to get away from school, classwork, homework, and a time to relax. However, in other schools; learning never stops. Due to schools wanting kids to learn during summer vacation, students are given summer projects to keep them focused. All students around different schools believe that having the chance to create things using their ideas will enhance their learning experience. Also, students feel as though that teachers are more in tune of what the students feel or want, rather than give them an assignment that doesn't appeal to them as much. Furthermore, I; myself as a student has had the chance to receive student-designed projects and to me, it's one of the greatest things not only for me, but for my classmates as well; it allows us to show our ability in what we know how to do and how well do we understand the topic we choose in exchange for a good grade.

In other cases, there are teachers who believe that classroom performance can play a roll in students receiving teacher-designed projects during the summer. Some teachers disagree in allowing a class to behave poorly or set low expectations for each other and give them an assignment that will be ""fun"" or ""enjoyable"" to please students. Other teachers for instance, think that students need to challenge themselves more in class and not settle for a decent grade, instead; elevate their work ethic to a greater amount for the grade they worked for. However, teachers will also give assignments just based on lesson plans or things they truly believe is what needs to be focused on and assigned to the students.

In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to have projects designed by them to see what they know, showcase their ability of creating a unique topic that's original, and allow teachers to see what students can do on their own, than seek guidance to have a planned project assigned to them.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"If we did a extracurricular activity everyday after school it could help us out a lot. Everyday after school each student should do a activity that gets their body moving instead of sitting down all day and not doing nothing. Some student's should try to do different activity's to meet new people and make new friends while other's just want to do it because it is fun.

I agree with doing at least one extracurricular activity after school. A lot of students do not like to go home after school because they do not want to be board all day because they have nothing to do at home. But when you do a after school activity you can have fun with your friends without a reason to be board. After school activity's can help keep you busy and out of trouble or it could help you bring your grades up if you are failing in one of your important classes that you are having trouble with learning in that class.

When extracurricular activity's pop up at your school you have to try it just for the fun that's in it. It may help you learn new games to share and play with your family and friends. When you are board at home you can just do the different activity's you learned at school such as Basketball, Soccer, computer games, or Building race cars and more to give you something to do when you are tired of playing on your phone or playing on your game system and you can not find anything else to do

Extracurricular activity's can really have a impact on your day in life. It can really help you get a lot of things done that you dont normally do on the daily bases instead of playing video games all day with your friends. These activities can really help a board person have fun for a day",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Changing the election by popluar vote for the President of the United States would be a better option than keeping the Electoral College. Although they have a meeting where they are voting for President and Vice President, doesn't the citizens of United States do the same thing. Since we help choose our states electors when we vote for which President we want, why can't our vote be the last vote to count?

Qualified citizens of the United States should have the final say so on who we want our President to be. We choose our President based off of what they said they will do to make the USA a better place. Instead of the citizens voting for a state elector we should vote for who we want President. Since we will be living in the type of envoriment they set.

The Electoral College is unfair to votes because of the winner take all system they have in each state. And if the Electoral College can't decide or have a tie , the election would be thrown to the House of Represetatives where  they vote on the President. What about what the citizen of the United States want our President to be?

Since the state legislatures are tehnically repsonible for picking the electors , those electors could always defy the will of the people. So leaving the vote up the elecotor is another reason why we should not keep the Electoral College. Citizens that vote can not control who the electors vote for. The electors can even get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. Or even take the advantage of thier own to vote for who they think is right, rather who the citizens wanted them to vote for.               ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"80% of Americans believe seeking multiple opinions can help them make better choices, and for good reason. Studies have shown the average Americans faring far better in their lives compared to their counterparts because they are listening to other's advice. There are also many myths that have the moral of listening to other people's opinions. For example, Perseus got his achievement of slaying a gorgon because he listened to the Oracle. Another example I have is the fable of Osiris, in which Osiris listens to Sekhmet and becomes the king of he underworld. In all of these stories, the hero listens to other people, and benefited from the people around them being more knowledgeable, more experienced, and giving the hero more choices to consider. Therefore, I believe listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice because they have more experience compared to you, know the pros and cons of your choice, and gives you multiple perspectives to deliberate over.

For example, let us talk about the anecdote of little Generic_Name, whose life was changed forever by listening to a person who has more experience than him. As a young lad, little Generic_Name always dreamed of becoming a soldier, because he admired his mother who fought in WW2. But Generic_Name's mother, who lived through the inhospitable battlefield, didnt want her child to follow her path. As a result, she talked to him about the hardships that plagued her when she was a soldier, and successfully changed his mind. Thanks to Generic_Name's mother changing little Generic_Name's mind, He became a successful and joyous doctor who saves countless of lives every day. If Generic_Name's mother hadn't been a soldier who has lived through the darkest depths of hell called the battlefield, then she wouldn't have been able to change little Generic_Name's mind, and he may have had his life cut short. Another story we can talk about is the story of little Generic_Name, who always wanted to be a magician. Generic_Name always fantasizes about being on stage, listening to the crowds wild applause as she entertains them, and thankfully, her father is there to fulfill her fantasies. Thanks to Generic_Name's father being a renowned magician, he had the connections and knew the tricks that could excite the crowd. As a result, Generic_Name became the greatest magician of that generation. If Generic_Name's father wasnt a magician who had walked the path Generic_Name was planning to walk, then she wouldnt have been able to reach the heights she was reaching right now. Therefore, I believe that listening to people who have more experiences compared to you an help you make a better judgment.

Another anecdote we can talk about is the anecdote of Generic_Name, a menacing ancient man who knew the pros and cons of doing drugs. As Generic_Name was walking the streets of New Jersey, he saw a group about to eat drugs. Generic_Name walked towards the group, and he latched his hand on to the nearest person's, and stopped the person from doing some drugs. Generic_Name reprimanded the group about doing drugs, and thanks to his menacing presence, the group stopped downing some pills. Thanks to the effort of Generic_Name who lectured the group about the pros and cons of eating drugs, the group was saved from the evil influences of drugs, and grew up to be a group who fought against drug use. If Generic_Name wasn't telling the group about the pros and cons of drugs, they would have eaten it and fallen into a path which is very hard to recover from. But thankfully, Generic_Name saved them from that despairing future. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted o be doctor. Generic_Name didn't know much about being a doctor, except that she wanted to be one, so her grandfather talked with her about her choice. As they discussed the pros and cons of being a doctor, Generic_Name grew more knowledgeable about the choice she is going to make. As a result, Generic_Name is much more firm in her beliefs about being a doctor, and grew up to be an amazing doctor. If she didnt' talk with her grandfather about her choice, she would have made an uniformed decision that likely would have ruined her life. Therefore, I believe that listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice by giving them the pros and cons of their choice.

One anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted to be a lawyer because her friend's advised her. She was steadfast in her beliefs as she always enjoyed rules and regulations, until her mother gave her a new perspective to mull over. She told her to aim to become a supreme dragon, rather than being a struggling python.

As a result, Generic_Name aimed to be a supreme judge, and she became one at the age of 65. Thanks to her mother giving her better advice, She became a star that outshone other's in the world of law. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name whose life changed thanks to a fateful encounter that changed his life. Generic_Name felt forced to be a fashion designer, as it was a family tradition.

He didn't know what to do, until he heard his grandmother talking with his family about animal cloning. He grew interested in animal cloning and researched it until he considered it a his future career. As a result, he grew up to become a biologist, doing something he loves. If it wasn't for his grandmother telling Generic_Name's family members about animal cloning, he wouldn't have even considered it, and may have grown to be a nihilistic person who isn't able to change his fate of suffering. Therefore, I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can give them multiple perspectives to consider.

In conclusion, little Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and many more changed their entire lives by listening to other people. If they didn't seek other's advice, they would have fallen into a path that would not allow their potential to bloom. But, thankfully, they chose to listen to other people. As a result, they grew to be figures that were respected around the world. Therefore, I in believe seeking multiple opinions.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Here are the reasons that the ""Face on Mars""is not real. I will tell you why it is not real. We know that no human has ever lived on Mars as far as we know. That is what we belive. Everyone can see the ""Face on Mars ""different. It also variys on what each person thinks.

We here have had also weird land forms happen here on our own plant .Sometimes we see rockes even here that look like faces but we do not think they are human face's or an animal face's. Landforms can be sometimes surprising on how they form. They can look as if it was something when it really is nothing at all. That is what happened at Mars a landform formed and it got the shape of a face but we know that Mars has not had live of people on it yet of course .We also know that no human has gone to Mars or landed their to proove it is a face when we know it is not. No human has lived on Mars so how can we say it is a human face when NASA has done alot of reascearch that only people have lived on earth not on any other plant so far. People also know that aliens do not exsite. Landforms can sometimes counfuse us to think something else that does not even excite at all. But like always NASA well be doing more rescearch to show people it is just a normal landform that just some people think it is face but it is not.

Hopefully this essay has helped you to believe that the ""Face on Mars ""is not a face after all it is all just a story that you can either believe media and the people that told you that or the real resceacrch people that one day will show that it is just a landform. But for now some people think something else and other people think other things. NASA is the people you should believe not the media. Hopefully I have my point across this essay to the people that think it is a human face. I see why some people can think it is a face becaus eat first you can see the face. But no it is not a face. Face or not face we will one day see who is right the people that think it is a face or the people that do not think it is a face.

"The face we found on mars wasn't made by a alien spacecraft.

The camera had to peer through wispy slouds to see the face so it could be just a giant rock formation made by the landscapes.

It is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the

American West the landform also reminds us mostly of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho. And the lava dome that takes the form of anisolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars.

Scientists figured it was just another martian mesa,common enough sround Cydonia,only thing different was this one had unusual shadows. Some people might think it's alien because they have seen the face appear on hollywood films,and books. We used a different camera which each pixel image spans 1.56 meters so if there were objects in this picture like airplanesmon the ground or Egyptian pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see what they were.

"The limiting on car usage would be a huge positive on the world and the people. As everyone knows, cars now adays are the key to ""Making it around the world"". They say cars make your life easier and its good for the economy. Some of those facts are true but at the same time not exaclty.

Automobiles are the ""linchpin of suburbs"". People can not live without their cars and need them for where ever they need to go ; work,the park,the store. Sooner or later in the future humans might not live at all with the usage of cars. In the article In German Suburbs,Life Goes On Without Cars, it says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe"".  All these fums and such are beimg spread in the air. And in Paris, pollution was a big effect on the peopel. Filing the air with smokes and harmful gases that affect a persons health. Do you want to go outside and have a hard time breathing?- Nope i didnt think so. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after intensifying smog. Diesel fuel was the cause of that only because France favors diesel over gasoline. This decrease in cars will be better for implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

When you buy a car, you need space for it to stay in. A space can cost up to $40,000 max. That is alot of money you could save for other appliances and daily life products. Also with a car you may get fines for speeding or anything in that state. In the article Paris bans driving due to smog Robert Duffer said motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. The less cars the better! why go through all that trouble. As well as less cars means no highway usage meaning more construction for buildings and stores. And think about it! More stores you can shop at and save more money to shop at those stores because you arent buying gas everywhere you go and paying for car innsurance.

Cars are benefitial for alot of things. But for the people and our future,it would be best to cut out cars and make our lives healthier and better. It will become a huge positive on the world.                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,3

Why i believe its ok for students to have their phone at school? I believe students should be able to use their phones because as long as its off it shouldn't matter. Also being able to use it during a certain time of the school day is also a good thing for a student because they may not know if their parents may want them to ride the bus instead of being a car rider. For example if a student isn't allowed to use their phone during a certain time of the school day and their parents text them saying they have to ride the bus, but the student doesn't get it then what is the student going to do. Because now the student has no way home , and all of this could of been avoided if the student was allowed their phone during a certain time of the school day.

Now you know why i believe that the principle should go with policy one. Allowing the student to still have access to their so is important. I believe with this new policy students will be able to focus a little bit more in class but also still being able to use their phone at a certain part of the day.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"At every school there are extracurricular activities other wise know as clubs. Clubs are after school activities that any student can join. I remember joining a club for the first time, I remember how scared I was because I didn't know anyone there, but looking back at it now, I'm so glad I did it. It gave me my love for volleyball now and I gained so many good friends out of it. Have you ever joined a club that you loved?

Extracurricular activities can let your mindset be creative if you didn't have the chance to be in regular school hours. Clubs let you think outside of the box, artistic clubs like theater, art/drawing, engineering, and more are ways to help your mind explore your imagination.

Clubs also give you a lot of social interactions with people you don't know. It's a way to make new friends, like being on a sports team. That's a great way of being social because, when you're on a team you create a bond with them every time you play a game. Wherever the game might be, on a field, court, rink, you always need to communicate with your teammates to keep the game going. Clubs also give you a way to learn better in school, there are a ton of after school clubs that help tutor kids that really need it. Extracurricular activities also help you concentrate better, for example chess club or golf. When you're in a chess match or golf game, everyone needs to be completely silent so the player can concentrate on the goal of winning.

Another reason for having extracurricular activities is that they are for everyone. There is at least one club for everyone that a person can be interested in, and even if there aren't any clubs that you like the greatest thing is, is that you can make your own club. You can present your club idea to the principle and school board and if they agree on making it a club, then boom, there you go a club that has all your interests.

Clubs also give you so many huge chances for the future. For example if your not sure on a career choice you can join a club that seems fun to you and if you like it you could possibly decide on a career just like that club. Clubs help you find interests that you didn't even know you had. Another example on how clubs can help you are sports, sports help you stay active and in shape. A huge reason why clubs can help you in the future, are scholarships. Being on a sports team can help you get a scholarship into a college, a college scout can come out to your hometown to watch you play in your game and if you are good enough and meet the standards their looking for in an athlete, you could possibly get a scholarship to a college.

As a result from learning that extracurricular activities can help you be creative, social, and help you so greatly for the future, I agree with the principle that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, after all it could lead you to so many wonderful things. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I think students should be able to participate in after school activities if they have a c for a lot of reasons. One reason why is because some students don't learn as fast as others so some students grades might not be as good as others either. Also if that student is not good at one subject why should they kick him off the team. I also think that the teachers should help a student that is not doing good.

It does not matter about the learning pace of students. I think that because some students learn faster they will get good grades and they will if they want to be able to be on a team. So what happens with the people who don't learn as fast. They won't get a b and they won't be able to be on a team. so at least if they can get a c than they can be.

Everyone has a subject that they are not that good at. For example i am not good at science. so why should they stop someone from being on a team if they struggle at one subject. Now if you are totally failing then they could stop you from being on a team for you can get more studying time. But a c no way.

It is all about the teachers and the way they teach. Some teachers don't teach really well and you end up failing their class, But if they are good teachers and they explain things clearly to you then you should pass, But if you are failing then the teachers should make you stay after school for they could try to make you understand the concept on which he is trying to make you understand.

So my main point is that if you have a c they should let you participate in school activities. because one students don't learn as fast as others. two some students might not be good at one subject and three teachers should at least try to help a student that is not doing so well. So I hope the principle agrees with me, But do you!      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In the artical ""The Callange of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it has, but that won't stop the will and dedication of people completing there dreams.

The author supports this idea by explaining what dangers there are to Venus and why it is worthy to go to Venus. As it states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmostphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" This explains what the dangers are on Venus and why its hard to go there. As it is said, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This explains why it is worthy to go to Venus, because it was like the Earth once which make scientist want to go study what happened there to make it a dead-like planet.

People are always trying to find ways to go to different planets, but it will be a long while before we achieve our goals.",0,persuade_corpus,0

"Vroom! Vroom! Is the familiar and common sound heard all across the world. Can you believe that cars can be so helpful and convienient, yet cause so many problems? The United States, Environmental Protection Agency, jumped on board with it's new promotion of, ""car reduced"" communities. This is a new act that will limit car usage, and help protect our Earth's environment. Motorits all over the world are contributing to the Greenhouse effect, stress, congestion, and pollution in the air we breathe. Countries such as, Columbia, France, and Germany are trying to reduce pollution, and the long term affects of cars have on the world.

Middle-class families, ranging from Chicago to Shanghai, make a huge impact on our greenhouse. Up to about fifty percent in the US alone emits carbon dioxide gas, instead of trying to reduce it. According to the international agency headquarters in London, the congestion and traffic within the capital of France, went down sixty percent, after fining citizens for being on the road after five days of a near-record pollution. The smog that covered this global city had one hundred fourty seven microorganisms per cubic meter. They had blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog. The cold nights and warm days trapped car emissions. If we started this new idea, we would see a large improvement within our enviromnment.

Beep! Beep! Traffic is such a stressful situation to be in. Wheather it is on your way to work, going home, getting lunch, or going to see a friend, the streests are flooded. This new act will promote the simplicity of transportation. This will release a lot of stress on people, and make their lives happier and healthier. People will be more connected and involved with their community and surroundings. Sidewalks are being layed out all throught cities, for people to find a new efficient way of transportation such as, walking or riding a bike.

Some countries are so used to not having a car or even having a space to put a vehicle. In Vauban, Germany, people are giving their cars up more and more. They just see the positive affects this ""car-free"" act has on them. Today seventy percent of families that live there do not own cars. The rate of people getting their license has gone down dramaticlly as well. Car companies are scared for their business if everyone tries to conserve energy.

This limitation of moterized vehichles may be just what the world needs to improve it's environment. This saves more energy, reduces pollution, keeps people healthy and stressfee. Living a life of simplicity will make you more happier.                      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Most people ask more than one person for advice there are many reasons for this but I'm going to say three reasons why I think people asking more than one person for advice is good.

One reason I think must people do this is to see which idea was the most responses. Another reason is you could test every idea that you get.

One last reason is some of the people could agree with the other person.

People try to ask a good amount of people just in case they hear more than one response from someone.

This is good to hear a lot of ideas and to see how many you get from the people you ask.

Don't ever be afraid to ask for advice from more than one person.

Maybe you have had to do this maybe you have had someone else ask you for advice.

Well i sure did I've had lots of times where I have asked someone in my family for advice.

Sometimes you are able to test some of the ideas you get.

This depends on what type of advice you are trying to take from someone.

Maybe you might be building something small like a shed and you have never built something before but you are determined to build it.

So you go and ask a friend that you know to tell you a few things on doing this job but before you go and build you go and practice on something so you know what to do.

I can relate to this you may even be able to relate.

I'm trying to build a tree house and I have had to ask for advice on building the treehouse.

The last reason is that one of the people you asked for advice may say or think the same thing as someone else that you asked for advice for.

Some don't think all the same things if you were to ask a bunch of people for advice they will not all give you the same answers but they will sometimes have the same meanings to them.

I think everyones ideas and try to show respect and listen but I don't take too much advice just in case that advice doesn't sound quite right like I said before don't be afraid to ask someone for advice.

Some people will disagree with my three reasons but I don't like to listen to the people who disagree with my reasons.

Maybe this helped you maybe it didn't.

To see which ideas was the most responsive ideas, you could test every idea you asked for and some might agree with one of the other ones you took advice from those are my three reasons on why most people take advice from more than one person.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Making Better Choices

Do you have trouble making choices by yourself? Sometimes people aren't sure what to do in certain situations so they ask for advice. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because other people may have more experience with the topic, you can learn a lot from others, and getting multiple opinions can help you feel more confident in what you are choosing. Advice can be very helpful.

First, other people may have more experience on the topic than you. If you haven't dealt with something much then it will be very useful to get advice and opinions from multiple people who have dealt with your problem before. You should ask numerous people about their past experiences to find out what worked best for them. All of that will help you come to a decision that will hopefully work out. Humans who have more knowledge on your subject will be wiser and can give you a lot of important input to think about when it comes to making a choice. I personally like to talk to my parents about issues because they know much more than I do and usually make the right choices.

Next, you can learn more about your problem from others. When talking to multiple people they may point out some things you never noticed or thought about, they can also look at your situation from another point of view. This is good because you may be focused on one thing but there could be many other important details that you overlooked. You should always ask more than one person about your problem so that you get a range of opinions and not just one that could be biased. Others may also have more information that you were not aware of.

Finally, if you talk to lots of people and receive their opinions, it will help you feel more confident about the decision you choose. If you are making a hard choice, it is important to feel good about what you decide. Knowing that other people agree with you and having a lot of feedback will make you more comfortable with your choice. It can also be less stressful if you know that others believe you are doing the right thing. Many people greatly care about what others think so it can be a relief if they are helped and supported in making a good choice.

In conclusion, listening to others advice can be very beneficial. You should always talk to numerous people about important decisions. I think that getting multiple opinions will help people make the best choice because they will gain more information on their problem, they will be more comfortable with their choice, and others might have dealt with similar problems before so they have more knowledge on the issue. No one has to try to find a solution on their own.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Many people seem to believe that ""The Face on Mars"" is alien activity. However, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the Face of Mars."" In that quote Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Explaration Program, states that he mainly recongnizes it from the land forms on Earth, rather than seeing it as alien actvity.

When the first picture was taken in 1976, technology was not as great as it is now or even in 2001. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared oto 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Meaning the qualtiy of picture taken in 1976, which convinced most people of alien, did not have great or even decent quality. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonis for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOS) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photo.

After taking the picture thousands of anxious we surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. When this statement was said not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April of '98-- a cloudy time of the year in the Red Planet. The camera in board had MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics alien markings are hidden in the haze. Which that is a resonable argument, but not being 100% postitive is too risky to throw into the public.

Garvin made an arguement that states, ""As a rule if thumb, you can descern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objests in this picture like airplans on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack, you could see what they were!""

Using all of the evidence and arguments, and just by seeing the picture, it was just a strange occurence that a natural landform found on Mars was shape as a human face. Also the fact that the picture was taken about fourty years ago changes a lot. The amount and the quality of technology has changed tremendosely.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that community service is a great requirement to obtain with the students. There are a majority of students that believe that this is a reasonable decision, however, there are some students that think that it is an irrational decision.

From my perspective, I would do the work because despite the fact that I play a lot of basketball and volleyball leagues at once, even I can fit in some community service. I don't believe that it is a matter of being able to fit it into your schedule, but a matter of being motivated to participate in these events. In the past I have taken part in some community service activities, when I reflect on those memories I have come to realize why some young adults as well as children do not like them. This is because there are two different types of community service events. One's that you can take part in and enjoy and ones that are boring that you have to put up with anyway. These can be fit into categories for different people interests.

Another variable is the benefit of participating in these events. Sometimes if there is no positive end result applying to themselves or benefit of participating in these events than children will prevent any way to help. If we can some how create realization and open peoples eyes to the opportunities that are right in front of them than that will reduce the population of children preventing the work. The benefit can be a prise or maybe just make them conceive and hopefully treasure how they've contributed to helping a cause or what ever the situation may be.

If you can identify the type of kid that you are dealing with than I believe that community service will be much easier to with hold within ours and many other school districts. If we can start by sacrificing time to help out than we can influence other districts and hopefully it will spread like a wild fire and create a community of children helping. With many children taking part, this may become a volunteer choice for many children or just make it an easier experience for them to acknowledge.

Sincerely,

"In this article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" i feel like the author has more negative than positive impact. The driveless car concept is good but the world is not ready for it. You will still have to have your hands on the wheel at all times, you will have to take control of the carwhen near a construction area or around an accident, and if the car fails then there is a chance that the blame could be on you.

First of all, these new ""smart"" driveless cars will only give you the ability to not have to think about when to stop and go. You will still have to have your hands on the wheel the whole time and also be alert. Wouldn't you rather just drive? Maybe these cars should actually be driveless but only used by people without the ability to drive with their hands.

My second reason on why this should not be an actual product in the future is because the passage even says that the car is ""Designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" That just proves that the car is not ready to be put on the road. If the driver has to take over when the road has changed or a deer crosses the road ,How long will it take to switch this control over? It only takes a second for a child to dash into the street and not pay attention to oncoming traffic.

My third and final reason being that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" We always hear court cases about drunk drivers and it it always their fault because they choose to get in the vehichle and do what they did, but what if we dont have control? How will a police officer know that we did not have the wheel at the time of the accident? Anyone could lie and say that their car was in complete control when the accident occured and could sue the car company.

In conclusion, the car is not ready to take on the road. You will have to keep your hand on the wheel at all times and stay alert, you will have to take the wheel anytime you are near a change in the road due to construction or an accident, and if the car fails then you will not be able to prove if it was you or this new ""smart"" car.

"Dear Principal

I don't agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress.

If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment's in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything.

If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldn't have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea.

I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future.

Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me.

"Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students would be less distracted by others, won't have to encounter and deal with bullies or any negative things, and can help people who are physically handicapped. Students will also be able to drink and eat when they so choose, and won't be restricted by their teachers. School can be very distracting for some and also very restricting so students being able to attend classes from their home can be very useful and helpful for students.

School can be a very distracting place due to others being able to bother the student and distract the student from doing their work. Taking classes at home and isolating them from any possible distractions will allow them to focus a lot better and a lot easier. Other people talking, loud noises, and other distractions can be a nuisance to the student and being at home can reduce the amount of distractions and possibly the amount of stress that can build up on a student.

A significant reason why students would benefit from being able to attend classes from their home is that they won't have to deal with being bullied physically, and can reduce the amount of negative things that a student can encounter and deal with. Online bullying is still a possibility, but not having to deal with bullies physically can help a student's mental health and reduce their stress.

Online classes can be a very big help to students who are physically handicapped and unable to travel very far. Being handicapped is a very big burden to someone, but if they don't have to go through the struggles of getting to school and instead they take the class online, then it can help them out significantly. Another reason why online classes can help a student is that they will be able to eat and drink when they so choose since they are in their own house. Teachers at school and school in general is very restricting, but being able to attend classes at home can give students more freedom and let them do what they need to do when they have to do it, like eating, drinking, or even using the bathroom.

One could argue that students wouldn't benefit from attending classes at home because students need social interaction with each other. Students can make friends a lot easier if they go to school normally and it would be hard for students to learn to socialize properly if they are only taking online classes and don't have people to talk to or friends to meet with. Schools encourage social interaction, but taking classes from their home would stop that and would only have online social platforms, such as Snapchat or Instagram.

In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to take classes from their home because it would reduce their stress and help their mental health, they would not have to deal with physical bullying, they would have less distractions, and they would have more freedom, despite the fact that it would be harder for students to socialize.",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Having extracurricular activities is bad for students because it consumes time, makes students more tired and frustrated, wastes money.

If schools were to require extra activities, their reputation would decrease from the story behind it. The shocking truth behind having school activities may surprise you.

Picture it, you're on your favorite sports team and you have a big game this afternoon and you can't wait much longer to go. Then, it suddenly hits you! You realize that you have an extracurricular school activity, all you do is just hope your team does well and win while you're at the activity. That's the case for most people. The main problem is that it's time consuming, especially for after-school activities. Students usually have to balance a lot with school with all of the homework and projects. School activities don't help with that at all. In fact, it even does the exact opposite. A lot of excuses at school are about how busy they are and why they couldn't complete their homework. With school activities, the grades will drop for sure from all of the uncompleted homework.

After a long day of school, wouldn't you already be tired enough? It's very important for children to get a good rest or break. A lot of people get tired during the school day, so a school activity will surely not help it. When people are tired, they don't have interest in anything, and a school activity would make it worse, causing boredom. The lack of interest one has will most likely make their parents go up in flames from the money they wasted on it.

Most activities are boring according to most students, so if the school would try to do something more entertaining, it would require more money. More money will cause bigger projects on the school which is just a waste of time. Money isn't only just effecting the school, but students as well. The price of activities are expensive, and will most likely just go to a waste. Sometimes students attempt to skip the activities to avoid all of the borringness which wastes their money a whole ton, and parents are not going to be happy about that.

Overall, students should not be required to do extracurricular activities from tall the effects that can happen on them. Not doing activities can save them from a lot, and it's very important we keep that way. I'm sure nobody enjoys failing grades, just from doing these activities. If the school doesn't' require extracirricular activities it can keep pushing it's way forward by raising the reputation of it. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hello, I am a scientist from NASA I am here to tell you that the Face, found on Mars, was not created by aliens, the face is just a natural landform. We have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from the NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is. The Face is just a mesa created by natural landforms. I am sorry to tell you but aliens do not exist, we haven't found any evidence proving that aliens exist.

Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet Mars taking some pictures of the possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking. While it was taking the pictures for the possible landing sites, something funny had happened, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face on the plant. It turned out to be an enormous head nearly two miles form end to end. No this was not created by aliens. Us scientist have been working as hard as we can to see how this ""Face"" was created. We haven't found anything about it being created by aliens. The Face is just a natural landform. Us scientist at NASA figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

A few days later us at NASA released the image to the public to see. The title of the image was ""huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head ... formed by shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" A few of us scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact, but it was talked about with the scientist of NASA and we decided that it wasn't created by aliens because there is no sign of life on Mars that we have found. On April 5, 1998, is when a Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera, also known as (MOC), team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The pictures revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no proof that it was created by aliens. Aliens do not exist they are just made up and scientists, like me, at NASA have never found evidence about aliens existing.

Not everyone was satified with the picture. Everyone thought that the weather conditions were different because the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. Since it was winter in April '98, it was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board, MGS, had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face, so people thought that the photo that was taken was not a fair photo. The people wanted a fair photo that they could see in almost the same weather condtions. We gave people what they want and we went to look for it again. Mission controllers prepared to look again but it was not easy. The face is very hard to track and get a picture of. The Mars Global Surveyor on Apil 8, 2001, went to take another picture, and it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The spacecraft had to be 25 degrees to center the Face. Each pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel, but when it was compared to he 2001 image it spans 1.56 meters. The picture was easier to look at and they got a closer view. They came to the conclusion of it just being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image from NASA, known as the Face, was not created by aliens. The image is just a natural landform.

"Having driverless cars is a great idea, but it could also be bad. It all depends on the person in the car and what types of decisions they're making. I think the world could work better with these cars. Although I also believe that these types of cars can be dangerous.

If businesses and manufacturers really wanted to, they could make these dream cars a reality. The cars that we have now are pretty close to being completly driver independent. All we would need to do is give the cars a few more updated sensors to replace the drivers. The updated sensors would act as the human reflexes; therefore creating better driving conditions. Hopefully this would create less wrecks or accidents.

Also these driverless cars should have updated satelites and cameras, so when there is a detour or road construction it will automatically update the cars route. This will help backed up traffic a lot. If these cars could have the best technology that's out there today, they would already be a success. For now that's the only thing that's keeping the cars from success.

Some people may be worried about the safety of these cars becasue at any moment in time there could be a glitch in the computer software, and that small glitch could cause an accident any second of any day. I, on the other hand, am not worried about that, becasue even if one car has a giltch there will be many other smartcars on the road to help avoid an accident. That's why these cars should definatley be on the road.

The driverless cars are coming, and they're almost here. All they need are a few more technological updates and they'll be completly ready for the road. And once they hit the ground it'll all be smooth driving from there.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"There are many reasons why you should particiate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is one-hundred percent, a once in a lifetime experience and opportunity. It is much, much more than just an adventure. It is a way to open up the world to yourself and others. I just couldn't say no, and you won't say no either! These are just a few of reasons why more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It is an opportunity/experience of a lifetime! There are many great adventures and ways to have fun. We got to take an amazing tour of a excavated castle in Crete. We also got to see China and Europe. Also, getting to see the Acropolis in Greece was very special. We also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. The streets in Venice, Italy are completly water!

We also have a lot of fun on the return trips, after all the animals are dropped off. We have competitions and play many games. We play games such as, baseball and volleyball in the empty animal holds. We also have many competitions such as, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, reading, whittling and much more! We have so much fun once the animals are dropped off!

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was the most amazing experience ever. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. It opened up the world up to me! I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. This was truly a great experience. The awareness I had then, is still with me to this day.

"I think cars should still be famous in the future so we could make new cars. such as cars floating in the air or cars that can drive on there own and drive us anywhere we want to go or cars that we could call in so we wouldn't to use our sell phones all the time. Or cars like the BMW could be upgraded for the future. And cars that have special sensers so the human driver can remain alert. And cars that can drive on its own and warn us if were going to have accidents. And google cars that can have fast WiFi and tv's so people wont get boared.

Then one day they could come out with cars that can always givbe you a heads up and always tell you about the weather and hoiw nice it is outside. Then if one of the drivers ask about the nearest place they could go out to eat or a park they could go to to have reunion of just to chill. then they could have cars that could drive you to defferent states like Navada, California. Florida, or District of columbia. And when something is wrong with the car it could worn the driver that its low on gas or something. Next the car could have Anti lock breaks when ever the owner gets in the car or if the car is going to be stolen the car could shut down or warn the sranger to get out of the car.

Next the car could have any station on it like country,rap, Hip Hop, or just any kind of music people like. Next they envent a new BMW that could speed up to 100 mph and then when you wake up in the morning the car could already have your coffee for you in the morning just in case you might forget. Then they could come out with a nother car called the Hyper BMW wich is the greatest car that has ever been anvinted. And in 2020 they would have cars that woulod have been huvering around and taking us every where.

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This seems rather odd to us to ask someone else rather than ourselves what choice to chose, but asking some one else for advice is actually very important and effective. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from, and you might not like the choice you thought of.

To begin with, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise. They may have been in a same or similar situation you may be in, they learned what they saw and is telling it to others along the way, they have greater wisdom about the world, having strong and thoughtful advice as well as being trustworthy people who would not try to steer others in the wrong direction, and they can pull or convince you to go into the right way to being a better person, in fact, some books and movies actually teach this lesson to the audience so they can learn it. All in all, you should get advice from people who are wise and are not on the bad side of life.

Next, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from. People from all the countries in the world see one thing or action different from how another person thinks, some have good outcomes while others have unhelpful outcomes, others might not understand what you are telling them so they might guess and give the wrong answer to you, singling out some of the advice given will make the chances of having a good outcome even greater, and people who known what their talking about, are often correct and suggest better pickings. To sum up, it is very good to have multiple opinions from others to see if one of their advice is better than the other.

Finally, you might not like the choice you thought of. It could end in an unpleasant outcome with bad consequences, your opinion could make you fall in with the wrong crowd of people, there is a high chance that stress will come to anyone who struggle with coming up with something to do, this may also cause you to have little confidence when you can not come up with advice for yourself, even though, it is okay to not know something and it is also fine to ask or talk to someone who dose know it, and do not try to come up with advice to something you can not do or know very little about. To warp it all up, if you come up with advice that dose not sound very wise, please ask another person so they can teach you the right way so you can be safe.

In conclusion, s eeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from, and you might not like the choice you thought of. You should care about this because many young kids and adults often do not ask others for advice because they do not know any better or refuse to ask another person they do not known to ask them for advice to do or not to do something, end up doing it that might get them in trouble or even get hurt. So that is why advice giving by people is so important because it steers those into the right path and get them up on their feet. So if you plan to hear or give advice to another person, tell them something wise a easy to understand so they could possibly pass it on to others. If you do this, then you will feel very confident in yourself and give advice where ever you go. If you do not do this, then you will not know what is right or wrong from another persons advice and you will likely not live a great life where you give advice but instead deny advice.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is often referred to as Earth's twin. It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. A difference would be a thick atmosphere. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Humans are curious of what Venus is like.

In paragraph 4, Venus could have once had oceans. It could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. It has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientists were able to study Venus, it would help us undertsnad the planet more.

It is hard to study Venus because the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also even more challenging are the clouds. They consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. On Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

In paragraph 5, it states that NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They want scientists to be able to float above the fray. It says that solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. These are not easy conditions, but are survivable for humans. It is important for them to get up close and personal despite the risks. There are many researchers that are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to study Venus.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is important. Venus is like Earth's twin. It is possible to humans to study this planet. NASA has ideas that will help find ways to study Venus. Technology can also help us in these experiments. In conclusion, Venus would be just another planet like Earth. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal,

I know you are debating whether or not to require all students to partake in community service, and I'd like to offer some insight on what I think about this subject. I believe that many students would be reluctant to perform community service, some for simply being lazy, while others genuinely have a busy schedule on a day to day basis, and simply wouldn't have the time to do community service. I believe that both the community and even the children themselves could benefit from doing community service, however if it is against their will, I don't think something like this should be forced upon kids.

Many children nowadays do a lot of extracurricular activities in and out of school, these activities are mostly sports, musically oriented activities, and artistic activities. Most kids love the extracurricular activities they do, and they have probably been doing them for years. To take that away from somebody, is to change a part of that person's life, without their consent. Children already have most of their choices made for them, and if you simply require community service to be completed by kids, then I believe they will revolt, and maybe even rebel against doing that type of work.

Doing this to kids is like treating them as second class citizens. Adults are not forced to do things such as this, so why should children? We also have hopes and dreams, although we are not fully developed physically and mentally, we still have the ability to think, and to feel, just as you do. If you were forced to do something such as this, how would you feel? Along with not being able to drive, to stay out at night, and many other things you were once prohibited of doing, and we still are today. We only have one childhood, one chance to do all the stupid things we want to do before we have to become serious, and truly enter the world as adults.

If you can remember what it's like to be a child, to see the world, as my peers and I do, you would understand where I come from when I say these things. Our lives aren't difficult, but they soon will be, from high school, to college, to working, right now is the only time we are truly free from the bonds of labor. So please Principal, please let us enjoy our youth to the fullest, and do not make us have to perform community service, without our consent. I'm sure many children at our school would be grateful if your decision reflects the feelings of yourself, but of the entire school community. Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME      ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The idea of driverless cars is extraordinary and could be a great plan and a great source of entertainment. Who would not want a car that drives by itself? The idea is great but it could potentially bring a lot of bad baggage along with it. The world does not need driverless cars because it is unsafe, defeats the purpose of driving, and is a waste of money.

Driverless cars are very unsafe. In the article it talks about all the things they can do, for example, it can steer, accelerate, and brake all by itself! Somehow, someway this is possible, but is it consistent is the question? Throughout the article they talked about tests they did and the results that came with the tests. While describing them the author used phrases like, ""It worked well."" Only one paragraph in the article they were 'for sure' that it worked. For someone to drive such a car they should have specific clarification that they would be safe while inside this vehicle, and they can trust that they have no worries and that this car will do 80% of the work for them. Also, if the car does most of the work for you, then what is the point of having a car?

Driverless cars defeat the purpose of even having a car. All of the processes you go through as a teenager with getting your permit or license is diminished, and in a sense you did all that work for nothing. The point of driving is having a quicker way of getting to the places you need to be instead of walking, biking, etc. In paragraph 10 it says that an automaking company named 'Tesla' is making a car that can be on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Ask youself, why would you waste your time on getting a car like that when you can ride the bus, train, limo, or taxi that would do 100 percent of the driving for you? That would just make me feel like I'm wasting my money on senseless things.

Driverless cars are also a waste of money. Automakers spend millions, maybe even billions of dollars making prototypes of these cars and testing them. Every time one of the test cars do not work they have to go and make a new one which is money that could be used for something a lot more efficient. The automakers to this day are still doing this, which is throwing money out the window. But not just the automakers are wasting their time and money, if people were to get this car they would be wasting their time and money also. People would waste thousands of dollar on one car that is pointless. Rich or poor this would be a senseless investment, because there are cheaper ways to get where you need to go. Taxi's, limos, buses, and trains are all great affordable ways of transportation. The automakers could find something that is a lot better and cheaper that could change the world.

Driverless cars is again a wonderful, awesome idea. It would definetly have a lot of popularity and publicity but is it really worth it in the long run? The automakers can find a lot of things that could change the world, and this is something the world does not need. The world should not have driverless cars because it is unsafe, defeats the purpose of driving, and is a waste of money. ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"As being human nobody is perfect and we don't know everything. This is why we need to ask others but even then sometimes they can be wrong. Getting good advice can sometimes be a challenge, so asking more people is probably a better choice then only asking one person. Looking for advice from multiple people apposed from one person is better because it shows multiple views of the topic, gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work, and includes different experiences of the topic.

Getting multiple views on the topic clears up that there is not any bias coming from a persons advice. What is a bias? Bias is a positive or negative opinion that someone has to an object, place, or person. Bias is not good for giving advice because it sometimes can shows a wrongful or untrue statement about the topic. Multiple views also gives the person more then one way to handle the topic and use different approaches to the situation. An example of bias is views on a person. One person might think someone is mean because of their first impression. Another person might be their best friend and say they are amazing, but both of these opinions are biased because of the way they have interacted with the person. It would be best to find a third party opinion who does not have a biased thought towards the person.

The next reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person is it gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work. Two people might give the same advice, but give different reasons on how it will work. This can show a variety of knowledge on the concept and give even more ways to approach the situation. In conclusion, asking more people for advice is more knowledgeable because of the different reasons people give for why their own advice will work.

The last way getting multiple peoples advice is better is that different people have different experiences. This means that people have had a scramble of atmospheres of the topic. It mostly applies to places and people not objects. An example is a person deciding on going to a water park. When asking one person they might say that it was very boring and not very exciting, so then they go ask another person and they said they had an amazing time and it's their favorite place to go. Both of the people went to the water park and had different experiences on how it went. It was really just their personal preference and the only way is to go to it yourself to see how it is.

Receiving multiple people for advice is shown to be better then just asking one person because multiple views on the topic clears up any biased that a person has, a greater understanding of the topic because the different reasons on why they advice will work, and multiple experiences that people have had show a variety thoughts when going to a place. Just remember when seeking advice many people have different views and opinions about certain topics.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Students know their capabilities. During the summer some schools decide to make teacher give students summer projects, to help keep their mental capabilities up. While students may not like this whole process there has been discussion on whether or not they should be student or teacher designed.

Teacher may want to have them design them because they think students would make it extremely easy which is fair. Though I still believe that students should be the ones to design it. Some of the reasons being that they were already given tons by teachers, they need to be independent and also to make sure teachers don't worry they can make guidelines.

People have to know when to take a break. Students throughout the school year have been taught many things by teachers which we are very grateful for. Though with it we have been given hundreds of assignments and projects all made by different teachers. So instead of stressing during the long break they can finish the project at their own pace and even have fun with what they designed.

Making students do yet another teacher made project when it's supposed to be their break will not help the students out, it will mainly make them upset and think it's unfair. So to balance that out having them design their own project would make it more entertaining for them and less stressful so to speak.

Let them grow up. After each year of school is over they go onto the next, and during the summer they should be challenged with a self designed project to help them be more independent. With this they are able to get themselves mentally ready for the upcoming school year. Each year gets harder and being tasked with this will give them the experience of handling things alone and figuring out exactly how to manage it. Meaning that they will learn helpful skills about time management, responsibility, and independence. These also help them outside of school for certain situations like social events or job interviews when they need to be by themselves and they will know from this how to handle it accordingly.

Teachers are more experienced. With people that think that teachers are the best option for designing the project I do understand why. Students are young and may just want to take the easy route by not putting much effort into it. While teachers have experience making projects and understand just how hard each component will make it. So using a middle ground will help teachers let their kids be independent. By letting the teachers give students a guideline on what exactly the project should or should not have, will let them feel secure about them finishing it. The guideline would explain the things needed for it and how it should be graded, and letting students know how it will be graded will help immensely when design it.

It will also help the students to figure out ideas for their design instead of them just being completely out in the open. So making a guild line will make both the teacher and students feel more secure and confident in the project being designed and completed.

Schools have to understand students better. With summer based projects being designed by the students they are able to have some fun doing it while also learning skills that are needed for both in school and out. Doing so helps them learn how to be independent and makes it so teachers will let them as well. So I do think that summer projects should be made by the students, because it helps them to learn independence, know when to take a break, and then let teachers know that they can do it but a little help at the start doesn't hurt. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Schools that give digital learning classes as a viable option to enrollment hurt the students because it does not give real world examples, help build social structure or teach good work ethic.

The schools that give enrollment via a digital platform can strip the youth of accurate real world examples. Over the web, students lose the ability to acquire important knowledge and examples from adults at an actual school since the students aren't attending the physical classes. When students do not show for class (physically), the student can miss out on experiences such as a friend giving a story that just might happen to be a good representation of how things in the world operate. This occurs because students are not there physically, therefore they cannot communicate and acquire such examples. When students try and acquire these examples, the information gained from a website, for example, is less valuable than information coming from whoever knows the info as a fact. If someone knows inside info on whatever the information the student is looking for, then it can almost falsify the info found from the internet. this works because if someone views what is actually going on, then it becomes more trustworthy than a simple Google search. Overall, digital classes can take away examples and experiences of how the world operates.

When schools allow internet classes, they weaken the students social structure and communication skills. If use of this form of communication occurs over time, it can cause the user to develop an anti social personality since the user is not talking to anyone face-to-face. This can cause, and encourage, lessened communication and social skills because being over exposed to use on the platform can give a feeling of relief. This occurs when ending a call with someone, the feeling is as if they had saved their own life, which itself encourages antisocial behavior.

When students talk over video communication platforms, such as Skype, they lose the urge to leave the house. The urge to not want too leave ones house can cause antisocial behavior and can send the urge to socialize plummeting since the enrolled student never tested their communication skills face-to-face with an actual person. If an anti social person is exposed to unwanted communication, it can cause the person to retreat into themselves mentally and cause the persons communication skills to go even farther back. in conclusion, if schools allow complete online classes, it can cause lessened communication and social skills.

Schools that give digital classes as an option can damage a students work ethic. This can occur because the student is not (and maybe never was) exposed to physical organization, which can cause sloppiness. The reason this can occur is because the computer they are using has so much space, the student does not know what to do with it, therefore giving a overwhelming feeling of distraction and unorganization. It can also be because they never really figured out how to be organized in the first place since the student was always distracted about meeting the standard. Students work ethic can suffer because when they are given a standard to meet, the student meets it without attempting to over achieve. This can cause students to lack in detail and be very robotic with what assignments are given. Therefore, it teaches an incorrect work ethic due to insufficient standard requirements. Overall, students that take digital classes can damage ones work ethic through inaccurate standards and inabilities in meeting physical organization through having too much space.

Schools that give digital learning classes as a viable option to enrollment hurt the students because it can strip the youth of accurate real world examples, weaken the students social structure and communication skills and damage a students work ethic.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I honestly think all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should have too participate in collecting community service hours. I think that because our community needs things done and kids could get fit while helping the community. Plus its like a bonus because the community and the students get something in return. While the community is improving the students are getting community service hours. For example the community has a lot of trash and other objects needing too be cleaned up. If the trash is cleaned up then maybe it could even reduce some of the pollution in our community.

They could also help by helping kids in elementary with what their seeking help in. That would Increase the community's education level. It would also keep some kids out of trouble. Instead of kids getting into trouble and wasting there time they could be helping the community out, and getting community service hours.

I disagree because, one all most every kid loves their sports if its watching it or doing it.

And second of all not every kid is as smart as a B or better average grade some can only get a C- or better. I know im only as smart as a C- average. So i say they should only have to keep there grades up at a C- or better to play any sport. Well look at them all most every kid has a C average so why not let them have a C average and be able to play in sports or other activities. If they have a B average then that's great but if they have at least a C average then that's good to, so don't you think we should be able to play sports or other activities if we have C` s? If everyone had B `s then we all would be as smart as each other and most likely get the same points on a test like everyone else, then the teachers would question if we cheated or not even though we didn't we just new the correct anwsers.

I think you should change policy for sports because more students should try there best to get good grades in there class because there trying to stay on what every team there on. Many students on a team get better grades in there class and some students who don't try getting better grades in what ever class there in get kicked off the team because grades come first in school not the team

If you made the policy for school sports get a B or A to stay on your team the schools over all GPA would be much higher because more student would try getting a good grade in what ever class there in. that a good thing for the class and school over all to. If the kids who get bad grades get kicked off the team would try their best next year because they see what they must do to stay on the team.

Fact more of the population try and work harder if there something on the line.

when your on a team theirs some much you can lose if you get kicked off. you can lose your friends, some of your team mates respect because you weren't trying your hardies to stay on the team.

"Dear senator my opinion of the electoral college is that we should change it to a more popular vote. As stated in the article ""under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors "" in this electoral college why do voters vote for electors and not for who they directly want voted in. Also what about the disaster factor and voters actually get confused on who they are actually voting for. At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system,in each state candidiates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the states they know they will have the best chance for more votes. Like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see the candididates at all, including Rhode island and South Carolina. The people need a popular vote because they dont want to vote for people who will vote for them they want to vote directly for the person they want to vote for and as everyone refers the electoral college to as an anachronism, a non democratic way of selecting a president that ought to be overruled  by declaring the candidtae who receives the most popular votes the winner. its official the elctoral college is unfair, outdated,and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without mush basis in reality. Cause some people get so confused or angry on who they are voting for they end up not voting or vote for someone completely random they become faithless as they cannot find a solution.           ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Students, having the ability to attend classes from home by video conferencing, will be beneficial to students and teachers because it allows them to save time and money. Schools worldwide should make online courses an option for everyone, it will give students time to do as they want without being restricted to sitting in classes for 8 or more ours doing the same activities everyday. The idea of being able to work home allows students to work in an environment theyÃÂ´re comfortable without any distractions whether they have transportation to school or not,this will give students the opportunity to sleep in more and not restrict them from enjoying time while they learn. The main reason i believe online courses will help is productiveness the students can do work at any place with local networking and will allow them to complete assignments and turn them in whenever they feel this will also save money, wasted money for public transportation could be used to provide students with a laptop and internet.

Teachers are always stressed with grading assignments on time but, not anymore online grading can be automated and uploaded within seconds. Parenting teachers can stay home with their children without worry something will happen while working.

"I'm headed to my first soccer practice, with no experience. The butterflies in my stomach start to rumble as I exit the car, due to the fact that I have never participated in any kind of sport. The coach lines everyone up to shoot the first shot of his or her season. I shoot... I score! Guess my opinion was wrong about activities. Ever since my new principle was hired at school, lots of changes were made. The most well being rule was that extracurricular activities were now required. When the students heard about the new action made, the school went wild. However, I support the principle's new idea. Whether it's sports or clubs, in my opinion, requiring at least one activity can provide the opportunity to try new academics, benefit college applications, and boost social status.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities provide an opportunity to try something new. Due to technology, a lot of kids have become lazy over the years. Even doing the slightest favor can seem hard, like washing the dishes. Now a day children need to be active more than ever. It all starts from trying something new, like a sport or club. For instance, many kids fear the lack of talent in activities, however, trying new professions may just reveal a secret inner talent. When an adolescent is required to participate in an activity, he or she cannot refuse. In addition, the requirement may motivate kids to try harder in their specific activity. Not only motivation, but individuals can discover new interests from performing multiple professions. For example, after children try multiple activities, they can analyze which one was the most appealing to them. In the aftermath, extracurricular activities would defiantly provide the opportunity to try new ideas.

More seriously, participating in many activities can benefit college applications. When it comes to college, many people seem to think about grades. For example, many parents believe that if their kid has perfect grades then they are assured a spot at Generic_School. However, that is not really the case. Colleges mainly look for active, involved, and hard working students. For instance, participating in sports, clubs, after school activities, and community service may get a student recognized more than others. It is all about being unique and standing out the most. For instance, receiving rewards from a category is very crucial, because on college applications, rewards can be expressed to get noticed. To end with, when kids don't have an interest or activity to participate in, it could affect them negatively, or positively in the future.

Finally, activities can provide certain individuals with social opportunity. Many children lack friends, especially anti-social kids. However, participating in activities that someone else relates to, may help start conversations. In addition, close friend groups can be formed. For example, joining a school sports team would provide the opportunity to hang out with the team, and when you are on a team, everybody treats each other like family. Close bonds are made whenever people can relate to each other. Instead of making online friends through virtual reality, kids should be making real, close friends. The kind of friends that can count on each other in the future. However, not all friends benefit an individual. For instance, if somebody is influencing others in a poor manner, those are the kind of people to stay away from. Kids should always be aware of who they talk to.

In conclusion, some people may disagree or agree with the fact of extracurricular activities. However, in my perspective, I believe that extra curricular activities are important. By not participating, people really miss out on new opportunities, futures, and friendships. Unless someone is unable to commit due to time, money, or health, kids should defiantly be required to be involved in the extracurricular activities.       ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some studies had say that, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students that attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Classes online or video conferencing are a way to learn for all type of students throughout their lives, even when they are college students. Online courses have helped a lot of students to graduate on time, and with the necessary education.

Students that attempt classes from home by way of online can benefit by learning as if they were at a regular school, however, other don't take advantage of it. Some parents believe that online courses do not help students to get the right education because students can get distracted very easily with what is happening in their surroundings. Other half of parents, believe that online courses are an amazing way for students; because they can finish their school courses at home while they can be able to help at home, or even while they have a job.

For example, many students that attempt to a regular school are more focused, and integrate to their education. Also, attempting to face to face classes is easier than learning a class online. You can learn so much quicker, ask all the questions you may have, and even work along with your classmates.

Another example, online courses are definitely not for every student, most students do not focused, and some get distracted very easily. Also, a lot of students do not benefit from an online class because they do not give all their effort to learn. They focused more on what is happening in their surroundings, and even they can fell sleep. Sometimes is really hard to focus when there are things going on surround us but it only takes a lilttle of effort.

Students that actually benefit from an online class is because they are interested on passing that class, and want to learn as more as possible; putting all the effort, focus, and heart on it.

As a conclusion, students that attemt to classes from home by a way of online or video coferencing can benefit from it and most can't. It takes a lot of effort and focus to learn from an online class, and that is a something most students do not have. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Everyone should have the equal opportunity to attend public school. Due to unfortunate circumstances some students don't receive this equal opportunity, and they can not attend public school with their peers. By offering distance learning courses to all students this issue could be resolved. A program like the distance learning program would give every child the chance to go to public school if they wish. The program would be simple; students could attend school from home via online or video conferencing. If more schools were to adopt this simple solution more students would be able to go to school and learn alongside their peers. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families would not have to worry about transportation to and from school, some students are too anxious about going to a public school, and for some students it is the only option.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families would not have to worry about transportation. The journey to school is different for every student. For some an easy five minuet walk will get them to school with no worries, others a fifteen minuet bus ride, and for few a treacherous path lies between their house and their nearest public school. This situation could prevent a child from attending a public school at all, or make it very difficult to attend everyday. The family shouldn't have to move from the house they love for their children to attend school. The distance learning program would be able to fix this situation. Fortunately for the family, with the distance learning program, the student would be able to video conference the schools from the comfort of their home. Personally, I know a program like this would benefit families like my cousins family who lives far out of the way and struggles to drive to school every morning because public school transportation does not go far enough to reach where they live. This program would take the stress off the family and continue to allow the student to attend public school.

In addition to taking the stress off families about transportation, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students are too anxious about going to a public school. Due to recent events, the anxiety of there being a school shooting has gone up in many students. Some students live in fear of being in the next school shooting. For some the anxiety is overwhelming and it makes the student no longer want to physically attend public school. This anxiety could also become distracting while in the public school setting taking the students attention away from learning and instead worrying about the possibility. This should not be a reason any student is unable to learn how any other student would in a public school. With the distance learning program students with this anxiety would be able to virtually attend school with peace of mind from their home. Programs like the distance learning program would help give more students peace of mind which would help a lot in times like these.

Lastly, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because for some students it is their only option. For some students schooling from home is their only option. For example some students have health issues preventing them from attending public school. They could be too sick or vulnerable to be around all the other students. Although for many of these students they wish to attend public school with their peers to feel like every other student their age. The distance learning program would be giving these students the opportunity to study among their peers in a public school setting. While some may say the video conferencing would be a distraction to students, it would be giving students who are unable to attend public school physically the chance to learn the way all other students who can attend public school physically do.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families wouldn't have to stress over transportation to and from school, some students are too anxious about going to a public school, and for some students it is the only option. This program would benefit not only students but also the school in many ways. Plus there are little to no downsides. Don't you think every student should have the equal opportunity to learn just like everyone else? Every child should have the chance to attend public school any way they can.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I think using this technology in a classroom would be a huge breakthrough. Teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or she needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. So the teacher can modify the way she teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.

This technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home. Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.

Humans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. We can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now. For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for.

In conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home.                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,3

Dear Principle,

I have heard that you would like to change the grades needed to participate in sports. I have a few arguments and points that I would like to bring to your attention.

Point A: I know that you would like students to have good grades, AND be able to play sports. Well, as an athlete I know how hard being on a school team can be. You have practice everyday, games are far away, and you still have to complete your homework and maintain your grades to be at least a C. Some of the best athletes are sometimes not so great at school, and if they get a C, are you telling me that you are going to take away what they ARE good at? Let's say for one week they get a C+ which is an 83-84% average, one-two points below a B, are you still going to take them out of basketball, or tennis, or whatever sport it may be? I can understand you taking out a player if he/she has a D, that's different, but for a C? In my opinion, that's a little unfair.

Point B: By raising the grade to a B, you may actually take away motivation, not instill it. They could either decide to not play, they could quit because they think they can't do it, they could switch to a recreational league, or they could sit the bench by choice of not working. By having a C average for your requirement grade, they will feel better about getting and maintaining that grade.

Point C: If many students at the school have a C average, they know that they can maintain that grade. If all of a sudden you raise the average to a B, you are not only going to lose kids that are active in sports and other groups, you are going to have kids that might possibly lose interest in school altogether. With all respect, it would be a stupid decision to change the grade. Here's another thing. For some kids, its ALL about activities and sports, and if that's taken away from them, they are going to lose interest even more than they already have.

Point D: Have some school spirit. If you take away the athlete's chances of being on the team just based on having a B or not, then you are taking away pride. Think of it this way, you take away the good athletes on the team, equals your school losing games, equals lower school pride, and the athletes' self esteem goes down.

I would really love you to consider not doing this policy, because of the effects it could have on our school. Thank you.

Your's Truly,

"Dear principal,

I think that kids should be aloud to help kid pick up litter and other things like that to help our community. If the kids at the school do this it shows other people that really don't care that there are some people out there that want a better community. So if we start it can really catch on and the more and more we do it the more it catches on to people. just like all of the drinkers out there that through there bottles or can on the ground or the other ones that cant make it to a garbage can or just didn't want to, care ,or feel like putting it in a garbage can. those are the people that we are trying to get through about this situation. so all kids young and old should be aloud to help the elementary kids with there school work or get some friends and pick up the litter, because there not hurting anyone there helping us and our community.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever needed advice? I know I have needed advice many times in my life. Everyone needs advice to make better choices. There is no one who can always make the right choice. Seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices because everyone has a different opinion, you can compare different opinions, and some people have more experience than you.

Everyone has a different opinion. That is one of the reasons why you should seek multiple opinions when making a choice. This is very important if you want to make the best decision. If you don't seek other opinions, you'll only consider your point of view. Your point of view may not always be the best point of view.

After considering multiple opinions, you have different point of views or opinions. Now, you can compare those opinions to each other. Out of those opinions, you should narrow those opinions down to just a few. Then, you should compare the other opinions to yours. After that, you can make a better decision.

Lastly, some people have more experience than you in certain areas. Some people probably had to make the same choice you are currently about to make. They may have made a bad decision and can give you suggestions on the best choice for you. You will then have more than enough knowledge before you make your decision. This will help you make the best choice.

In conclusion, there are many important decisions you have to make in life. In order to make the best choice, you should consider many opinions. I say this because some people have more experience than you, everyone has a different opinion, and you can compare those opinions. Your point of view is not always going to be the best point of view. With that being said, if you seek multiple points of views, you will have the knowledge to make the best choice possible. ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"School provide Teaching to those Students that can not assist to School, How? , well so many students have many problems to arrive to School. One of them is that They do not count with Transportation and they live far away, or some students that have special cases. So Today some School give you the option to teach you from School.

You must have a computer or device that allow you communicate with schools, if not, you won't be able, The only way that you can learn from home it's internet, but at the same time there are people that can buy those resources.

Study from home have pros and at the same time cons, pros are those can help you to learn the same themes that students learn at school, also you get you degree and can Apply to colleges, but, there is the case that they won't have a healthy and normal life at college.

Learn from Home is that you can finish it in the time that you want it, you can spent your time as much you want and finish it , but, what are you going to do after finish it?.

People that learn from home do not know what is converse with people around them, That is a big problem that can affect their life in future, They won't know where they at, or how talk with another person. That can be so stress, often they will feel exclude from their milieu.

Learned from home could help you to skipped school and you won't have to wake up early but, is not going to be the same that a regular student got in a normal school, why?, because a normal student can talk and ask his doubts in issue of time. They have many resources that School can give you. If you are learning from home, you won't be able to ask and resolve your doubts, you will have to search by yourself and figure it out.

We can not forget that people that have special cases, well, that people have at the same time special programs that school offers, some Schools are able to receive them and work with them at school, and other Schools can give you an option to work from your home, Those programs were designed only for people that born sick or have problems since born.

If you don't want to go to School, you must have a reasonable excuse, because you have to apply for it, you can not decided that you're not going to School because you don't wan't it, and you want to learn from home. Specially from public school that request a letter and proofs that you can not assist to school, and then They will analyze your case.

"In Nick D'Alto's article, "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author suggests that Dr. Hung's new facial regonation would be useful for many things including using it in a class room to read stusdents' emotional expressions. I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions. In his article, he uses the Mona Lisa as an example, and I personally think that it was a good example to help show her conveyed expressions.

Dr. Hung invented the Facial Action Coding System, which helps identify the emotions displayed on the human face,and paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. If this technology was used in a classroom setting, I think that it could be used to help teachers understand if some of their students are enjoying the lesson. Or it could possibly be used to tell when the students are lying to their teachers. The Facial Action Coding System shows the six basic emotion that are associated with the movements of ones facial muscles. The basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can also identify mixed emotions.

Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday. For example, a friend could probably tell how you feel by looking at your face. But some people might have trouble describing what each facial expression means. Dr. Hung had oserved had aritists like leonardo who had studied human anatomy that had helped them to paint human emotions. Similarly, Professor Hungs Facial Action Coding System is able to be electorically stored with some information about human anatomty and emotions.

Lastly, there are fourty-four major muscles in the human face. For example. a muscle called the obricularis oculi pars palabraeus is the muscle that makes the crow's-feet shape around your eyes. Experts can tell a real smile from a fake smile by the way your mouth is moved. Facial muscles can help produce emotions, by the movement of your muscles. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, I think that teachers could easily figure out the emotions that their students faces are conveying. This coding system seems to be revelotionary to me because of it can decipher emotions and it could help many people such as students, teachers, and even the government.

In conclusion, I personally think that with the help of this technology teachers will be able to read into their students emotions better. Also, teachers would be able to tell if students are lying to them. The value of this technolgy would be able to help them read the facial expressions of many people with diasbilites who have trouble conveying emotions. I beleive that is this type of technology were to be used in a classroom that it would be a great help to many teachers.        ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I , Luke Bomberger, am a memeber of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The Saegoing Cowboys help people who were affected by the war.

I believe everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for three reasons.

Not only do you get that warm fuzzy feeling from helping people out, but you also have a once in a lifetime chance to go sightseeing have the time of your life onboard, and explore the most beutiful and amazing places on Earth.

By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you get to help out the less fortunate explore go sightseeing and have fun.

We help people by bringing them animals from overseas such as horses, cows ,and mules.

When we bring the people the animals it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling of acomplishment.

You should also join because after our missions, we have some time left to go sightseeing in the area.

Some of my favorite things to see were the Panama Canal and ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

I also had the opportunity to expore much of Europe and China as well as taking a gondola ride in Italy. I also got to take a tour of a castle in Crete. If you think that the fun stops when you climb back aboard for the ride home, think again.

The stables where the animals were kept becomes a baseball field and a volley ball court.

We also have table tenis tournaments as well as boxing and fencing matches.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun as well as important.

In conclusion, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""

I reccomend becoming a Seagoing Cowboy because not only are you helping the world, but you get to have fun while you do it such as sightseeing and exploring.

I myself have gone on nine trips as a Seagoing Cowboy and loved every second of it.

It also opened up my eyes and ""made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""

So,unless you are doing something useful with your life, become a Seagoing Cowboy.

You won't regret it.

"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has 44 major muscles in the human face programmed and their movements detectable by its software. While some may not understandable the use of this technology, it would be groundbreaking and highly effective within our classrooms. Many humans portray false or pretend emotions to other humans for various, different reasonings. However, the FACS could be used to break through this method of manipulation and deception by tracking the facial muscles being used and moved by its subject. It would allow the computer to calculate the different emotions and feelings being present in its subject, which could be used in a matter of many different ways.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by. A major benefit to using this program would be detecting distress in students, allowing the school to assist them and receive the help they need to succeed. The FACS could change how schools work forever if they were used in our classrooms and it would be for the benefit of our students.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Students would not benefit from being able to attend class from home because, students would not receive the same amount of help from the teacher as a student in class would, some students would not focus because there could be multiple distractions , and they would not finish their work on time, and students would not be able to work in group assignments, and not elaborate as well in group discussions.

When a student is attending a class from home, they may not receive the same amount of help because of how many students there are, it would take a while for each one to receive help. If a student attends a class online, it may take a long time for the teacher to respond to emails, discussion boards and get questions answered. A student who is in class can easily ask the teacher directly, and face to face if they have a question on a worksheet, an assignment, or on the lesson. The student attending the class online would have to wait to have their question answered and by the time the student has moved on, the teacher's response would not help the student and they would not benefit from it. When a student has a question on the lesson, the teacher may not understand the question fully in detail and answer it in a different way. This would not benefit the student because they may need to go out of their way to learn from another source and then be behind on their work.

Students that attend a class online would take it at home, when they are at home then there could be many distractions, and the student could procrastinate. If the student has more distractions in their learning environment then it can lead to the student not being able to learn and understand the topics the class is covering. This would not be beneficial for the student because if attended in class, the teacher could control the environment of the students and it the student could be more productive. Attending the class online could mean that the student is procrastinating the assignments, and turning them in late. If the work is turned in late, or they are not doing the work, all the work could pile up and become an issue for the student because they have the responsibility to complete them in a certain amount of time, and end up with a bad grade.

Classes in school have many assignments that involve group work and group discussions. When a student attends the class at home they have to do online discussions, but most of the time it is harder to elaborate in discussions online then it is in person. The student can lose communication skills and makes it harder to do group work online. If there is an assignment that has to be completed by a group, it would make it hard for the student who is not there to be part of a group and can affect their grade and really not be beneficial to the assignment. It is easier for the student to be there in person to help out as much as they can, when students do group work it is usually to expand their thinking and give each other ideas to use for the assignment. It is harder to give off ideas or receive ideas through an online class, it would benefit the student more if they are able to directly tell and help the other students face to face. It would benefit the student more to be in class at school to expand social, and communicating skills.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend class from home because, students would not receive the same amount of help from the teacher as a student in class would, some students would not focus because there could be multiple distractions at home, and procrastinate their work, and students would not be able to work in group assignments, and not elaborate as well in group discussions.                                                                       ",0,persuade_corpus,3

By making community service something they have to do in that school for a grade or something like that is not fair. The person that chooses not to stay after school may have something already filled in that time spot, and cannot attend that function for that day.

Another good example why this student cannot attend is because it cost money that the family needs for something else. Maybe they have to live paycheck to paycheck. This problem could be solved but, it might be a little difficult for the school. The school could maybe not have anything cost money. Yes community service is mainly volunteer work but what if you need to buy a t-shirt for the events? Also what if you buy a shirt but you can no longer fit into the shirt because you have a growth spurt? If you had to be apart of that group you would eventually have to pay for another shirt. Most likely this shirt will be the kind that you only wear when you go to the events and no where else. This will mean that you now just spent money on these two shirts that you will never ever wear again in you lifetime.

This is why I feel that you should make community service optional for students in your school.

"Some students rather attend school from home, but personally, it's notably more beneficial to attend classes from school. It is too big of a responsibility for students to wake up in their very own home and do their work and assignments. Also, It's much more interactive and reliable to be in the school enviornment. It's also much easier to achieve higher grades and expand on learning abilities.

The responsibility of having students wake up early in the morning and learn is enormous. Having to do work from the household is easily distracting to the students. They are surrounded by games, and devices that are not obtainable at school. There is a different mentality of being in a home rather a place built around learning. When at home, students are not used to spending hours upon hours learning and doing their assignments, and when bored or tired have easy access to avoiding their work and abandoning their tasks. Simply going for a drink of water or gaining easy access of electronic use with no monitorization is time subtracted from the required learning.

The enviorment of school is built around thorough plans of keeping students engaged and learning. In school, there is supervision, enforcement by the teachers and administration given to the students to do their work. Not only are students encouraged to do their work in school, but they're given more opportunities to learn their subjects and material. Students having assistance and guidance from their teachers, staff, and peers is beneficial to them because it gives them the chance of asking questions and having one on one help that's not given over a digital screen. This help leads to better grade results and better performance by the student.

There is much more than just learning that students benefit from attending a school rather their home. They're introduced to new people. Students develop social skills and bonds that they don't even know about. . There are many cases of homeschooled students who complain in the future on how awkward they are when they speak to new people, or how they interact with others. Having the chance to socialize with those nearby, speaking with them , and experiencing events with them eliminates this problem and leads to skills and relationships in the future. Attending schools sets up students for the future in not just academic or educational ways.

It's important that students are not secluded from the outside world in the future and have the chance to strive for success. Rather being in the confined, comfort of their own home, students are given more opportunities and a chance at a better life. It's concluded that schools are more beneficial to a students overall success.        ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Through the school year students are required complete many learning based projects that are designed and instructed by teachers, but as the school year ends many teachers fear that students may lose the knowledge gained over the year during summer break. To prevent this from happening many schools require summer projects that reinforce knowledge learned during the school year. Many people argue if a teacher or student designed projects are more effective to help retain knowledge, but student designed projects are believed to be more effective. When a summer project is designed by a student it gives students a chance not only learn while completing the project, but to learn while making it, students receive a real world experience, and students experience a sense of freedom

During summer many students have the desire to quickly complete the assignment a teacher has assigned, by doing the bare minimum, but if the project was designed by the student themselves it would give them the opportunity to learn while both making and completing the project. When you develop a project, a lot of research is need to be conducted, this gives students an opportunity to absorb more information, then if they were just completing a project. Designing a project also gives students knowledge in the topic their project is on, as well as skills on how to make projects and other important research based skills that are not focused on in school, but are necessary in higher level education.

Not only do student designed projects give students an extra opportunity to learn, but it also provides students with a sense of real world experiences that enhance learning, and general skills. After high school graduation many colleges and universities require that students conduct research projects designed by themselves, in order to receive a degree. This may be very difficult for students coming from an environment were teachers design everything, but a student developed projects in school would give kids an experiences in this situation helping them latter in life, and making college projects easier to complete. Also, in many work environments employees are left on their own to complete tasks and projects, and an experience in designing your own project during school years would help people develop necessary skills for an post- graduation career, as well as high school or college jobs. This experience would also gives students something to put under leadership on a college application.

Another essential impact of allowing students to design their own projects during summer, is that this allows students to develop a senses of freedom that is locked up during the long school year. Throughout the school year teachers provide projects that are essential for learning the content, but prevents students form using there creativity and expanding on their freedom to think in different ways. During the summer if students were allowed to develop their own projects they would feel more free, this would allow them to experiment with different ideas and concepts, this also would allow them to figure out which way they learn best. While being away from an instructor such as a teacher, kids could use their own ideas to create a project, that is not influenced by others, and this would show schools and teacher how much a student truly understands not just the knowledge that a teacher is forcing upon them. A sense of freedom is also important for preparing students for their next step in life, whether it is a higher education level, or a career, because, it is important students get an experience learning by themselves.

Summer break projects are one of the essential tools in preventing students form losing the knowledge that they difficulty gained throughout the year, and student designed projects provide a more effective alternative to the rigid teacher designed projects. Many people may argue that teacher designed projects are the most educational and effective way to help students retain their knowledge, because they are made by experts in the subject, and are designed by adults, or that allowing students to develop their own projects is a waste of time, but teacher designed projects prevent students from acquiring real world experiences, freedom, and an extra learning experiences that a student designed project would provide. Summer break projects may be helpful in allowing students to learn but people will only receive the most out of this if they are designed by a student.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Why students should participate in extracurricular activities. You should consider doing a extracurricular activity. Because participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help you branch out, make new friends, and you can have access to Currier interests. These are very important because they can help you have a overall better experience at school. Many enjoy doing these activities and find it very relaxing to get away from school for a while and try something new.

Firstly, you can branch out and make new friends, when participating in extracurricular activities. When you are doing something you enjoy, you can find people with the same interests as yourself. Many people like myself love doing extracurricular actives. For example I love doing FFA, I've met so many great people along the way. This organization has taught me so much, such as life lessons, leadership skills, and team building strategies.

Secondly, this is a great way for students to interact with others. In addition they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. Sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. Working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the the yearbook. Finally the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. This club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams.

Thirdly, Currier pathways options, this is a bonus to participating in at least one extracurricular activity. You may decide to try something new and really enjoy it. In the future this could possibly be a Currier interest for you. For example if you choose yearbook, a Currier option for you could be photography. There are many options out there, but this one extracurricular activity you choose, could help you make that decision. On the other hand I would think about choosing one of these activities.

In conclusion, you should consider doing at least one extracurricular activity. You can branch out,interact with others, and have access to Currier interests. These activities can really make you more skilled at what you love to do. Therefore I encourage you to do at least one extracurricular activity.              ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Imagine being in a classroom full of loud students. You wouldnt get much done. With that being said dont you think that giving students the opportunity to take their classes at home? Although some students need ""hands on learning it should still be an opportunity. It sounds like a fantastic idea to me because some students work better alone and around no one, and it could also help students stay caught up and work at their own pace, and it would show how advance some of the students really are.

To begin with, some students work better by alone and around no one. Some times being in a classroom can be difficult for students. Most of the time its really loud and no one is really paying attention which can be hard for the students really trying to just get their work done and pass the class. Not saying that it has to be completely silent in a classroom for everyone to focus, but imagine being in a class where the students talk the entire period or continue to get in trouble, it would be hard to stay focused and get everything done right? When students get around other students they tend to do things to empress one another which can make it very hard for other students to get their stuff done. Meanwhile students could be at home doing their work. Just picture how much you could get done in a shorter time span at home by your self! A lot right? The only way you could get distracted at home while your doing your work would be if you distract yourself.

In addition, it could help students work at their own pace. Have you ever been in class and the teacher starts going to fast and your too busy trying to catch up that you end up not knowing what your doing? So wouldnt it be just wonderful if you could stay at home and do your classes online and just have video conferences. You could work at your own pace and go as fast or as slow ass yo please. Even if you felt like you need help or if you even had a question you cold still get in touch with a teacher that would be very willing to help you with whatever you need help with. For example at my school we have an online class called Plato which is something the school uses to help students make up any classes they need to make up at their own pace. Its not as bad as it seems, the whole course is do at the end of the year which gives you year to work on it whenever you feel like it. Students would get so much more done if they could work at their own pace. In a classroom full of students everyone works different some people work faster than others. Every students is capable of doing it but some just dont work as fats others, so giving them the opportunity to their work at home, and at their own pace is a marvelous idea!

Last but not least, it would show how advance some students really are. Being in a classroom can be very difficult especially when it comes to seeing how much your students really know. For example my freshman year in high school i had this friend named Generic_Name, everyone in that class though he was so smart he did all of his work and even turned in om time. Near the end of the year when we were testing everyone had submitted their test except Generic_Name, and when he did he had got the lowest grade in the class, when the teacher asked him hat happened he couldnt give her a reasonable answer, later we fond out the he had been cheating his way through her class and he couldnt cheat on the end of the year test. Now for his sophomore year he takes an online course for that class and hes actually doing much better and his grades are great. Now that he gets to work at his own pace and gets to do his work as he pleases hes doing way better! When you let students get the hang of what their doing and work how they want they tend to d better and make more progress. Scientist read that 89.7% of students that take their classes online tend to be more advanced.

Now that you know how beneficial giving students the opportunity to take classes online is you can agree with me because, some students work better alone, and around no one, and it could help students work at their own pace, and it would show how advanced that student is. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Summer is the time for students to finally relax their brain and rest before restarting that thinking engine again. It's all fun and games, until students forget the material and have to learn everything again. After recognizing that, some schools required students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

Even though the idea and purpose of summer projects is present, there's been a debate on the format of those projects: teacher-designed or student-designed. The difference between teacher-designed and student-designed projects is that teacher-designed means the teacher sets specific instructions on how to complete the project; whereas, student-designed is having the student create a project off of a prompt. If schools require students to complete projects during the summer, it should be student-designed because it gives them the opportunity to learn independently and think creatively.

When you are younger, you are dependent on any adult that could guide you in anything: school, work, home, etc; but as you get older, you beging to form your own opinions and start to crave more independence. Your need for independence becomes restricted because the school system doesn't allow you to be independent. The school system gives the students the mentality that you have to follow the teacher's rules because of the concept that the teacher is always right and the student is always wrong. This prevents students from learning independently, because it requires the students to depend on the teacher and makes students believe that they are always wrong. If teachers encouraged students to learn independently by having their projects be more student-designed, their accademic performance could improve, they can become more independent, and bring out more ideas to the table. Learning independently gives students a sense of pride after accomplishing their goals by themselves.

Not only does student-designed summer projects help students become more independent, but teaches creative thinking. When you were in preschool, you tended think outside the box or color outside the lines because you were encouraged do so: you were encouraged to be imaginative. School encourages you to think creatively or be creative, but how can you do that when your creative abilities are being restricted? Summer projects that are student-designed is a good start for learning creative thinking because it gives the student time to learn and adjust by themselves. If students were able to think more creative, they would be able to learn how to think above and beyond and might even bring some new and reformed ideas to the table. Having school projects be student-designed is relevant to creative thinking because it is a skillset that you won't only need at school but in the workplace as well, because businesses thrive off of new ideas to help increase profit.

Some may argue that teacher-designed projects are more easy to grade and helps keep students from going off-topic. Even though teacher-designed projects are easier to grade for teachers, it limits the students' ability to push themselves to go farther and think independently. Straight-forward instructions does keep students on track on the topic, but it doesn't motive them to actually do the work. Teacher-designed projects have step-by-step guidelines and rules with a clear idea of what the projects should look like which makes it easy, but it is more restricting to the students' creative abilities because it doesn't allow for them to think outside the box; which causes them to lose the motivation to complete the project. Student-designed projects allow students to think more freely and be less dependent of teachers.

Although there are disadvantages in having summer projects be student-designed, advantages help in th long run because it teaches and encourages students at a young age to be more creative and independent. Anyone can follow simple instructions, but thinking creatively and learning independently are difficult skillsets that you can't accomplish with step-by-step guidelines. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The principal has decided that all students must do an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be fun or can just give you something to do. However, I do not agree with this. The principal might have a good reason for doing this, but students should be able to do whatever classes they want to do and not do whatever they don't want to do, and some extracurricular activities could clog a busy student's life with unnecessary work.

Students should be able to choose whatever they want to do. Some might want to take extracurricular activities, and some might not want to. One of the most important things about work, school, or any type of job is that it doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're happy doing it. Happiness has a large effect on anyone's life. It is very important that a student is happy with whatever they are doing, because if they do not like what class they are participating in, they might not want to do their work, which could lead to bad grades, which could lead to anxiety or depression. Then, they might not be able to focus on their other classes, and that means more bad grades. There are many other paths that not enjoying your work can go down, too.

Some children's lives could be very busy. Let's say that a child is living in a family that does not have much money, so they need to stay home and babysit their siblings. An extracurricular activity such as a sport can lead to the child not being home until even later that day, which means their parents have to stay home to watch their other children, meaning the parents can not work to make more money. This could lead to very difficult financial issues for the child's family. In fact, this happens too often in real life. This could happen in real life to a student at the school, and they might not even be able to afford school anymore.

The principal should most definitely consider their decision. Extracurricular activity can affect student's lives in many different ways, but some of effects can be not at all beneficial to a student. Unnecessary work can affect emotional, physical, and mental health in more ways than you can imagine. If students want to do an extracurricular activity, they can, and if they don't want to, they shouldn't have to. Not being able to make your own decision can not only affect what you want, but also what you need.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principal, as a student, I believe that the use of cell phones should be allowed at school, but only during lunch, and students free time and only then. Cell-phones should be allowed during class period only on every day that does not end with the letter 'Y'.

'The reason being?' someone may ask, and the answer would be as follows; 'The reason being that all class periods are meant for the learning of information, not an overload of texting or making of calls, but for learning the real skills in life that students will soon need in the upcoming future.' The main reason why cell-phones should be allowed during a students own free time would vary from help the helping of homework, to calling a family member because the student may have forgotten to bring a project to school.

That is why I believe that cell-phones usage should be allowed at school, during a students own free time, but during the class period only when Hell freezes over and no sooner.

"Dear Principal:

I, as a student at your school, personally believe that the completion of community service should be a requirement in our school system.

I believe there are many causes that could greatly use our help.

Not every student in our school will agree, but several also may.

Younger students could very much enjoy our help, with their school work, or just being a mentor to them.

There are several students who do not have anyone they can positively look up to, and could use a good influence in their lives.

Also, our city could immensely benefit from our work that could be done.

For example, we could clean up the litter around the neighborhoods, fix the playgrounds and parks, or simply improve the looks of things.

Don't you agree this would be an amazing ordeal?

Imagine the city after our school improved it.

Think of all the children who could be helped and encouraged, in many ways, with our works.

There are more ways than just these, as well.

Students could volunteer to assist in putting together care packages for those in need.

Also, we could work shifts at soup kitchens and places, to feed those who can not provide for themselves.

Many things can be done in our community.

I believe that without the encouragement, many of today's young people will not involve themselves in these activities.

This is why I believe the right thing to do is to make it a necessary requirement that each student participate in an amount of community service work.

After all, not only would these things benefit the others in the town, but it would also benefit for us, as the students here, too.

Let us not forget the greatness such acts would bring to the teachers, in every school within the area, as well.

The younger grade level teachers would receive much help from us, if we were to be there for the students, as a tutor, role model, or anything.

Then, once the students reach the level that we are now, you, as principal, and all your staff, could also benefit from the same children when they become your students, in a short amount of time.

From the words I have given, please consider creating the plans for a community service requirement within our school system.

Thank you.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. Although having students design summer projects sounds like a good idea, teachers should design them because of their great knowledge and experience.

Teachers will always have more experience than students due to schooling, teaching, and past experiences as well. Experience is key to have while making the project because it will make the project more understandable for the student, rather than making it more difficult. If a student is given a project, and he or she doesn't comprehend what it is about, there is a very high chance that the student might not do it all, especially in the summer. Experience can also be helpful in this situation to set the expectation of how good the teachers want the project to be overall. Teachers also have to know what the student is capable and what the student is not capable of doing to make it possible for them. If a teacher was to give a normal tenth grade english student a twelfth grade AP course project that is college level, the probability of that student understanding it will be very slim.

The knowledge a teacher must have has to be enormous. The reason I say this is because students will always have questions about certain things, and teachers have to be able to answer them in an intelligent manner and put it in terms that the student will understand. Another reason why knowledge is important is it to create the project itself. Teachers must have the knowledge to create an assignment that is set to the standard of the class, has the sufficient workload and criteria for the student to comprehend, and the sufficient time for the assignment to be completed.

In conclusion, a student should be able to do an assignment with no problems whatsoever. A teacher would surpass the student in making an assignment for students. A student would make a decent assignment due to the lack of knowledge and experience, and teachers have a tremendous amount of those two qualities that makes them who they are.               ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Dear Mr. Senator,

The citizens of your state are crying injustice, but nothing is being done to serve them. The Electoral College goes against the Bill of Rights opening words of ""We the People"". The current system of electing the President is more complex and less beneficial than choosing our leader through popular vote. The popular vote actually listens to the people of the United States' opinion and how they want this country run. The Electoral College has many faults such as in the case of electoral overuling popular vote, possible corruption of state senators (no accusation presented), and could lead to the rare event of a tie.

Such as in the election of 2000, Al Gore should have won the race. The people poke through the popular vote to choose him, but the Electoral College thought otherwise. As stated in the article, that usually state senators choose the representatives of the state in the Electoral College, if bribery and corruption affect our nations such as those in the Miuddle East, the presidential race can and will be rigged in one party's favor. Due to Mane and Nebraska policy of ""proportional representation"" could lead to a tie.

As you can see, the Electoral College has many faults and is outdated due to the rapid population increase of our nation and reasons stated above. Some may argue there will be inaccuracies with popular vote whereas we already use the popular vote today as a way of forecasting the oucome and seeing the people's real choice.

"Driverless cars are more than likely a big thing of the future. There are pros and cons. However, when it comes to the safety of human beings, I'd say to focus on more of the cons. Bad things happen all the time, an dmost of the time they are accidents. I'm not sure I'd risk my life on something I'm not in control of.

Let's start off with the pros, because there definitely are some. Elderly people, or even extremely young people. May find it difficult to get places that they need to go. With the help of a driverless vehicle, grandpa would never miss another doctors appointment. That is, until his driverless vehicle that you so carlessly persuaded him to purchase puts him in a coma. People that are afraid to drive or physically cannot, they could really use a driverless vehicle to help them get place to place. Now, let's get down to the cold hard facts.

Technology, it screws up all the time. Millions of people have troubles with their cell phones, game systems, and cars (yes, even regular vehicles malfunction) every single day. If some manufacturers can not even get a regular everyday car to work correctly without shutting down, blowing up, or getting unalined, how are we to trust that a driverless vehicle will suddenly keep us safe. Sure, drunk drivers would be less of a problem, but how can you trust a drunk man to properly operate a driverless car? You can't. Anywhere that there seems to be a pro for these cars, there's a con not far behind.

Raging drunk idiot get in his driverless car. He decides he wants it to go full speed ahead at the man crossing the street. It's too easy to use these cars as weapons and call it a malfunction. There would be more cases of vehicular manslaughter than ever before. I don't know about you, but I like my life without driverless cars. They're too hazardous.

I don't want to live in a world where cars aren't things you drive. I like my life. I like knowing that most of the people on the roads know what they're doing. Technology has failed us again and again. I don't trust that it wouldn't do it this time around.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The more the better ! Getting Advice from many people is something that every person has do at least once. Getting advice from many people can help you get a different perspective, it can help you in the future,and it can help the community.

Having a different perspective is really good . When you have a different perspective of something you might have a better adtuided . Let's say you fail a test and you have a really bad adtuided and you asked many people what could you do to help and what they say can make you feel better which causes you to have a better a adtuided. Having different perspective also gives you different opinion. I believe that having different opinions is something you should always consider because you most likely will hear the same thing and you might like what they say but you might hear something different and you might like it even more. Having a different perspective can not only give the situation a better perspective but it can also give you a different perspective. Hear me out not only can other peoples perspective give the situation a different point of view but yourself as well. I believe that having advice from many people can really help you have a better perspective, adtuided,and understanding.

Advice from more then one person can help your future. As you grow up you will release that you start to ask for more and more advice. I think the more you ask for advice the more you are most likely to be successful in your future. Advice that is given to you now will help you your whole life. For example my teacher once told me that not understanding how to do something is okay because from that is how we learn from it. The advice given to you is something you will pass down . I think that it's amazing how much advice form who know how long ago has come so far. Advice can help you in the future by developing more and more,remembering it though your life,and pass it on to other generations.

Advice also helps the community. It is proven that when advice is given the community becomes better. I believe that the community can become better when given advice. Part of becoming a better community is teaching others how they can become better. I think that this can be done with giving others advice. When advice is spread form person to person it spreads form community to community and then it spreads from state tot state and eventually the world. Advice needs to be spread all over the world and to make all our communities a better place. Advice can not only impact the community but the world as well

Asking for opinions from more then one person can help you see different opinions,help you later in life, and help the world. Advice can help to see different points of view, help you in your ,and help our community become better. In conclusion I believe that getting advice can help having different perspective and help the community.                 ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"School is one of the most important aspects in life. It provides many opportunities for jobs and occupations. Lately, students have been asking questions about how schools should offer online learning as an option, so students wouldn't have to show up for school. Even though waking up to go to school can help train for a job-like environment, going to school can cause students to be drowsy in the morning for their first lecture. Students would benefit from being able to attend class from home because students will be able to focus more without their peers distracting them, students will be awake now that they do not have to wake up early in the morning, and students will have all their assignments and homework online.

Attending class from home would benefit students because students will be able to focus more without their peers distracting them. In every classroom, there would be at least one student talking which can be distracting to others. For instance, when the teacher is covering a topic that is very crucial in the curriculum, there would be side conversation that would distract the students from learning. If this was the case in every classroom, then online courses would benefit students from these distractions.

School starts early in the morning, and students are usually tired around that time and can not focus. Online school would usually start around when students wake up naturally. As a result, this solves the problem of students being tired. Many students head start to their job after school and don't come back home until late at night. This causes them to be tired in the morning at school.

Students that take online learning can benefit from it because they will have all their assignments online. When students, in school, do not turn in their homework, they will always have an excuse for not turning it in. For example, students will tell their teachers that they didn't receive one, or they didn't know there was an assignment or homework. In online courses, all assignments are online, so students can not have an excuse for not turning it in.

Online learning is beneficial and should be an option in every school worldwide. It benefits students because students will be able to focus more without their peers distracting them, students will be awake now that they do not have to wake up early in the morning, and students will have all their assignments and homework online. In conclusion, students would benefit from online learning instead of going to school.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"This artical shows that Dr. Huang could maybe idntify human emotions on an computer, but they would have to scan your face to prove exactly what you might be feeling. They use Leonardo da Vincie's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa -- as an example; when they do this they say that she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. But, How could a computer read your emoitions? Could we really ues this in a classroom to help identify students emotions lke they did in Leonardo da

Vincie's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa --. In the aritcal it says that this computer could see if a student is confused or bored. Dr. Huang predicts ""That it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."", but if this computer is doing all of this then would there be a need for schools or teachers. This new tecnology is making as though this emotion reading computer could be placed in you're home and then you're children could just learn there. THe reason i say this is because if it can tell when a student is bored or confused then what would happen if the other students are getting it then it changes just so one student could understand it. Would that confuse the other students, or would it help everyone in the long run? Maybe they do have a good idea and maybe it really could help., but I also this it could hurt as well. It could put school teachers out of a jod. this computer could making it to were there is no need for schools because this computer could be instaled into your house and your childeren could just learn at home. Along with them learning at home this computer could tell them other ways to understand the work by reading their facsal expretions and emotions.     ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Some schools have programs where you can take classes from the luxury of your own home. It would either be online or in a video conference. Having a way to learn without being there is conveint for most people. Some students have a hard time making it or coming to school because,they may have a disability, having problems with their peers, or they can be drained physically and mentally.

First,disabilities are already hard enough to deal with but, having to wake up early to get ready and try to catch the bus on time is a struggle. A girl that went to my school was in a wheelchair, she had to take the bus in the morning and get picked up in the afternoon. One day she said, it was hard for her to get up every morning because she could not move from the waist down. Her parents had to get off from work because they had to pick her up from school each day. Most students have learning disabilities like ""ASD"" and need special attention.

Second,problems with your peers or teachers is one of the biggest issues when students don't show up or come in late. Some people may argue that coming across conflict with people helps students get ready for the real world. Even though that maybe right most students don't care. Most students if they are having complications they won't show up because it will continue. Students end up with depression or anxiety.

Lastly,students have jobs and other things to do in their time. They don't have time to keep up with the class. Balancing schoolwork,homework,a job,and family and friends can be a lot for one person. people that are in the military can be and class and work at the same time so they need to take an online class which would be more convient for them. Highschoolers that have a job find it hard to balance their time but, taking a class online will make it easier for them

In conclusion, it would be beneficial to have online classes in general. Having a way to learn without being is school is really helpful for some students. Students with a disability can have extra help. Most colleges are online anyways so, this can help you prepare for college. For students with problems with their teachers or peers can swicth to an online class.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When the last day of school ends and summer begins, most students are happy to put their education on pause for a few months.

Some schools, however, encourage students into continuing their education over their break through the assignment of summer projects.

These summer projects should be designed by teachers.

Projects designed by teachers tend to be more well structured, and a teacher designed project would also be more challenging and engaging, encouraging students to continue learning over their season long break.

A summer project designed by a teacher would be better formatted than one designed by a student.

Teachers have more experience than students when it comes to project design, and a well-designed project would make for a meaningful learning experience for students.

Their experience would allow them to create a project that they know would be adequate in meeting the goals that a summer project wants to achieve, which is to encourage students to learn and enrich themselves during a long period of educational drought.

The teacher would also be able to design a balanced rubric to for the project, to ensure that all students learn the same, crucial research or analytical skills by completing the project.

A teacher designed project would be more equal; it would be less biased, as a student designed project would most likely be skewn to play towards their strengths, in order to make the task easier for them to complete.

Teachers would make a summer project more challenging.

More challenging projects would result in a higher quality learning experience and would also be more engaging.

The higher difficulty a project is, the more effort a student has to put in in order to get a good grade.

A rubric designed by a student and a rubric designed by a teacher would be very different, as a student would be more likely to increase the point values of less difficult categories and decrease the point values of more challenging categories.

A teacher would be less likely to be biased and establish appropriate point values that vary by difficulty; meaning, higher points would be assigned to more difficult sections and lower point values for easier sections.

In my own experience, I have learned more from projects that have required more time and effort than those that required little effort.

For example, in an online course that I am taking, I am required to write an APA formatted paper every two weeks about a topic that I know little to nothing about.

This experience has taught me a great deal more than an easier project would have.

As these higher difficulty projects require more effort, this would effectively meet the goal of a summer project, and coerce students to keep learning and furthering their education during their break.

While a student-designed project would allow students the opportunity to learn about what they were interested in, a teacher-designed project could easily accomplish the same task.

A teacher-designed project that allows a student the freedom to learn and research topics that they find interesting, would combine the benefits of a student-designed project and a teacher-designed project.

The good formatting and difficulty of a teacher-designed project paired with the creative freedom of a student-designed project would result in an assignment that would allow a student to learn about topics that they find interesting, thus meeting the goal of a summer project.

Allowing a student to choose what topic they research will also benefit them in long run, as tend to retain information that they find interesting, meaning that the project will not be completed just to start the new school year off with a good grade.

Summer break is usually a time for fun and relaxation, but that does not mean there is no time for learning and enriching yourself.

Summer projects encourage learning and enrichment, and a teacher-designed project would help to meet those goals more effectively than a student-designed project would.

Teachers would make a better structured project than students would, due to their experience with project design.

A teacher's project would also be more difficult and therefore more engaging for students, as a teacher would not be biased and make the project extremely easy.

In conclusion, a teacher-designed project would more effectively enrich a student's summer than a student-designed project would. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Should students be required to join an extracurricular activity?

Joining an extracurricular activity can benefit the student's lifestyle in many different ways.

All students must participate in at least one activity because it helps them find a new hobby and will benefit their health and academics.

First of all, participating in new activity will help students find a new hobby.

Students have a opportunity to discover something that they never knew they would have enjoyed.

For example, when they attend an club such as yearbook, cooking club, or soccer, they may end up liking that activity that could lead to a future career, such as being a writer, chef, athlete, etc.

Second of all, they will find themselves constantly busy.

Most teens are always complaining about how bored they are, but once you find a hobby, you will be motivated to practice it rather than lying around on their bed or going on their phones.

Students may discover a new hobby they enjoy when they join a club.

When they join an extracurricular activity, they are benefiting their health and academics.

For example, joining a sports team will improve their mental and physical health.

Playing a sport will not only help them get their daily exercise, but they'll be able to make new friends that will cheer them on along the way.

Second, academic related clubs improve their learning.

When they join academic related clubs such as poetry circle, book club, or math league, it can help improve their grades and increase their knowledge.

Students' health and academics can be improved when they join an extracurricular activity.

Joining a club will help students experience new things and be able to improve their lifestyle.

Students will be able to experience different things throughout their school life and make new friends.

They'll continue to try new things as they grow up and meet new people. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"When I came to United States I had to learn English to become a psychologist. I went to school to learn and adapt to new place. I thought that no one couldn't help me. Until, school gave a solution that help me and motivate to achieve my goals. I'm proud of learning by summer projects made as student-designed. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because help students to build knowledge, experience, and relationships.

First, the summer projects should be student-designed because it will help increase students' knowledge. Also, creates an environment to help students build strategies that improve their achievements. Complete projects during summer will prepare them to learn quickly a subject. For example,

Generic_Name and Generic_Name improved a lot during vacations. They enjoyed learning through the methods both adapt. An example, both felt insecure with the teachers methods to teach. So, both adapted a method step by step to learn the subject. Generic_Name learned to listen and communicate her ideas through the projects as a student-designed. Meanwhile, Generic_Name developed patience and strategies to solve his problems in math. Generic_Name and Generic_Name improved in science and math. Although, Generic_Name and Generic_Name believed that summer projects weren't helping enough. Their knowledge increased a lot by the summer projects that both complete. In addition, project made as student-designed improve and build greater coefficient intellectual.

Next, complete summer projects by student-designed will create a bond with the students's experiences. For instance, the experiences that I helped me learn English. I developed a purpose to learn a new language through the situations that I live. I came to United States without any knowledge of English. I felt lonely and mad because I made many mistakes in my classes. My English skills didn't help me enough to comprehend any of my subjects. Then, the experiences that I lived in schools became a motivation. I feel secure about myself and the skills that I builded through summer projects made to student-designed. Another reason, each summer project made as student-designed are based in their experiences. Some students may need methods to concentrate as their classmates.

Finally, students-designed to learn subjects and build relationships through activities. The summer projects that are student-designed will improve strategies and build relationship between classmates and teachers. For example, my sister Generic_Name preferred to work alone than as a group with her classmates. Despite, her grades decreased and make her feel pessimistic her teacher gave her a solution. The solution was to learn as group with her classmates. Generic_Name accepted her teacher's solution to increase her grades. The summer projects that were student-designed help her build relationships with her classmates and increase her grades. Furthermore, I'm sure that summer project that made as student-designed help many people to build relationships with anyone in the same situation.

In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because of the huge opportunities to help us as students to improve our motivation to learn. The chances to learn during vacation will make us feel prepare to comeback to school.

A way to help students to learn and believe in their capacity to become the future of the country. People that believe in the students to achieve their goals. Despite, the numerous mistake we made to achieve our goals are the motivation become an excellent student. So, I motivate you to believe that summer projects should be student-designed.           ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I believe they should change the voting to popular votes. In my perspective voters are the most important in the elections. There opinion on the president should be able to count either way. Lots of voters feel left out like there opinion dont count. Sometimes the president elected by the electoral college is not the one every one wanted; he has diffrent points of view in what he want to do.

The president that the electoral college has elected is not always the one everyone expects to be. Lots of presidents have won by electoral college not by the voters. These presidents that are elected by the electoral college can possibly be the presidents to bring the United States to the ground.

The voters feel they know what is best for our country. They always elect the person that will bring America to the top. For example Barack Obama he is helping immagrants go back to school be able to get a job and be something in life, like maybe a mechanic,doctor, or even a federal officer. They chances that he has gave us lets people know that these are the type of presidents we need.

People feel left out because if the electoral college ar the people that are going to select the president what is the point in voting. Lots of them feel that electoral college is more important than what we the people think. The electoral college doesn't let people feel that the person hat they have selected is the president that will help out the United States Of Americam to become number one.

On the other hand people believe that the electoral college is good and we should keep having it. They believe this because because they think that they know what is best for us. Also that their vote is the best option than ours.

I believe that the president should be able to win by popular vote because we the people shall select the best president. The president that will once again put the U.S back on top. The president that wins should win by popular vote not by the electoral college.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Over the years many schools have assigned summer projects as a way to help keep students minds active while on break. These projects can include reflection essays, construction, reading catalogs, and many other wonderful things. At the moment many of these projects are designed by the teachers, however many schools are considering switching to projects designed by the students. Students designed teacher approved projects would be better for the future of education as they would allow students to think critically, increase their desire to learn, and tailor projects to their strengths and learning styles.

To begin student designed projects allow for more creativity and critical thinking rather than fallowing a check list the teacher created. Most teacher designed projects rely on specific structures and check list drawn up by the teacher for the students to fallow. They do no prompt the students to: think, learn, ponder, and reflect, rather they give students a list of mundane tasks to complete and check off. Critical thinking and complex learning comes from hands on practice thought and refection. Giving a student a complex prompt or problem and allowing them to design the project themselves in order to answer it, stimulates the brain far more than handing the student an assignment where the answers have already been neatly planed and laid out by the teacher. For a better education students need to be able to solve problems on their own and chart their own waters, they will never grow if they are always defendant on a teacher to tell them what to do and how to do it.

Furthermore student designed projects allow students to focus on things they find interesting and want to learn about increasing their overall desire to learn. Often times struggling students or children who ""hate"" school may just feel bored and there are many students who don't try in school because they feel like the subjects they study have no purpose or that it will have no value for their future career. These students often do not participate in teacher designed summer projects as many see summer as their time off from the burden of school and teacher projects appear as boring and useless to them. If these students were allowed to design hear projects, however, so that they focused on topics important to them there could very well be an increase in their participation and desire to learn. When people study things they like and enjoy the often perform better this can be seen at schools like the Generic_School MATA programs where every student who attends wants to be there and as a result they are active and engaged each day. It can be inferred that if the logic applied to the MATA programs is applied to summer projects, students studying things they enjoy increases learning motivation, more students would participate and find value in summer projects.

In addition to the a fore mentioned points student design projects could be tailored to a students academic need and strengths in a way teacher designed projects are not. While many teachers say no child left behind that is often not the case with summer projects. Because these projects are assigned before the teacher gets the chance to really know the students a it is difficult to adjust to a students specific needs. A teacher may assign project with lots of heavy reading not knowing that a few of her students are dyslexic, or a different teacher may assign something on a topic many of the students are already well versed in so it has little value to repeat it. Student designed projects would avoid these conflicts as the students know themselves best and could be able to tailor their project to their strengths. Many English classes have already found success in doing this where instead of assigning books that students may have already read or are difficult for some to read, these classes allow students to study books of their choice or listen to audio books. Student designed projects are often more applicable to students lives and as a result they are a better form of education and learning than teacher designed projects.

Some may contradict that student designed projects would promote laziness and the students would not learn anything of value from them. This is why these projects would have to be teacher approved; however, even if they are not the value of learning to think and the other benefits of student designed projects outweighs the over specified structure of the teacher designed projects.

In the end student designed projects are most beneficial to students due to their freedom to allow for critical thinking, the study of subjects students enjoy increasing learning motivations, and their unique ability to be tailored to each students needs. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

If you change the policy so the students don't get to participate in sports or other activities the students will have a reason for not going to school. School is a place for social and enhanced learning. Kids get to have friends in school and with the sport activities it makes it easier to get friends. Friends are important for the learning process because friends help each other when they don't understand an assignment in school.

Student cant find any reason for coming to school if they don't find it interesting. They'll think its just a waste of time if they cant have fun. If the students don't go to school then schools will shut down and the mayor will get disappointed. Even though this will get their heads into studying more; other kids wont care. When the children who do work hard see that their friends don't care, they'll give up.

Students like having activities after doing hard work. Some kids try their best to succeed but the passing grade is just to high for them to reach. You shouldn't blame them for not having the ability to make progress by taking sports and other activities away. Some children cant even find help at home either because their parent don't speak English or their parent don't care whether their son/daughter get to be someone when they grow up. Its not their fault they have no reason to do better in school when they think the people around them don't care. You should think twice about taking things away from the innocent.

"I disagree with the principal because students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. When I go home I watch my younger brother. I don't have time to do after school programs. After school I become tired because I don't sleep. So when I come home I would like sleep. After school programs should be a choice and not required.

My brother has epilepsy. I need to watch him so he doesn't have a seizure or I can help him. If i stay at school and he has a seizure. There is no help for him. My grandmother is getting older and has difficulties walking. If she falls down the stairs how can I help her if I'm at school. I have things to do and so little time.

I often begin the process of sleep at around 10-12. I wake up at 6 am. I 5 to 8 hours of sleep and

I need those hours. If I dont get my required amount of sleep hours. I become a Goblin/Gremlin and live in the dark basement and the light burns. So now you know why I need my sleep. I become less productive and less effective for learning. After my long and painful days at school I sleep. I come home and eat and do homework and then I sleep. The next will be harder than the day before it. So if I stay for extracurricular activity I won't be able to sleep.

The most expensive thing is time. We use it everyday and we have so little time. I have a life and you should too. I have things I must do. I would not to spend it at Animie Club. The precious time would be wasted. Its my choice to pursue education and stay after school. We spend a quarter of our lives at school or learning. I would like to see things and do things. Go places and see things that are new. I think having extracurricular activities are good. Their not good for all us. We have lives too. We may have jobs or sports stuff we need to do.

"Car emissions are very deadly and dangerous. They can be lethal to humans, and also dangerous to the enviroment. It can lead to big enviromental issues like global warming, holes in the ozone, and air pollution. Many ignore the fact or are oblivious to it, but driving hurts our enviroment just for a little bit of convienence. Are cars doing more harm than good?

Cars have a convienent way of getting us to our destination faster but at the cost of our precious enviroment. We use our cars sometimes without thinking twice of what the actual after effect is. Paris is a city that has had almost, if not the worst, smog levels in all of europe. It has 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter due to the majority of cars which have diesel powered engines. Air pollution doen't jsut effect our atmosphere, it slowly kills, if not severly injuers, animals and people. It hurts us by causing major damage to our lungs and respitory system.

Greenhouse gases are another major thing in car emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases that keep or trap heat on earth to keep us from going into another ice age. A decent amount is good and is used to do its job, but when you have too much then the globe starts to increase in temperature. Antarctica, as you know, is made of ice. when ice gets to a certain temperature it starts to turn into a liquid. So when antarctica starts to melt into the sea, the general ocean level will rise, causing sea level cities, states, and countries start to flood with salty ocean water. If we cut down on gas or diesel car travels, the and greenhouse production rate would slow down and so will the rising temperature of the earth decreasing the speed of the melting arctic.

Cars are a very important and convienent way of travel but can be very deadly to us humans and tne earth we live on. Because we use them everyday doesn't mean that we can not cut down or change our ways of transpertation. Cars give off many harmful toxins and gases that we can, but refuse to control. we can cut down on the majority of the waste by limiting our car trips distance wise and based on how many times you leave the driveway. a simple change as in riding a bike or walking or even only going out when needed can slow down the speed of global warming and even drop the levels of air pollution. A little change can maybe just save the earth from another flood that can wipe out humainity.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during their break. Many projects are designed and viewed differently. In this case, student-designed projects are more beneficial and productive than teacher-designed projects that are assigned to students. If a student were to design their own project, it would feel less like a homework assignment and more like an exciting activity to do, based on their own rules, and very diverse and full of different ideas.

Imagine a student wanting to stay inside their home to do homework, instead of playing outside with their friends, that is how one would act if their summer assignment was student-designed. A student would feel highly encouraged and motivated if their assignment felt less like a project and more like their own favorite activity. Many students would do anything to avoid homework, but if their homework felt like a video game, they would have the energy to start and finish it without a doubt. With the assignment being a summer assignment, they most likely have a good amount of time to work on it, so, they will not feel pressured or rushed while working on it as well.

Also, students can focus on other homework once they finish the project knowing it is completed and their best work, which will be, since it is student-designed.

Every project has a rubric, but if the project was student-designed, it would be very unique. Yes, the students would have to follow a rubric but it would feel like the students' own rules. They will go with their own imagination and make it more like their own favorite activity, than like a project with strict and vague rules they may not understand. Following their own rules can also result in many creative ideas. Sometimes, a teacher-designed rubric can be confusing and cause stress on a student, affecting them personally, and making it harder for them to comprehend and complete the assignment.

A teacher can also have fun with a student-designed project. Grading the projects may be very entertaining and satisfying to examine. If a teacher chooses to present their students' projects to others, it may be entertaining for the audience as well. Since the projects would be student-designed, they should be unfamiliar to one another so, there is a higher chance for a teacher to come across cheating. They will encounter many different ideas and possibly learn something new from each and every one of their students too!

If a student were to recieve an assignment where they could express their different and creative ideas, create their own rules, and make the assignment feel like their own without feeling pressured and stressed, it would make a huge difference and very much beneficial for both students and teachers. To assure students are continuing to learn over summer break, student-designed projects are more productive and superior than teacher-designed projects.",0,persuade_corpus,2

"Driverless cars will be helpful for people in the future. There are many pros to a driverless car, if the cars can be made and used then they could help give parents and kide more freedomes. Driverless cars can help with safety on the roads.

Driverless cars could give parents and kids more freedom. They could do this by allowing the parents more free time, because they wouldnt have to find the time out of their schudule to drive their child to a friends house or to a move. The car could pick up the kids and then the kids could text or call their parent to let them know that they have gotten to the place safe. This could also help with being on time, The car would come around the time that it was told so kids would not be able to say they were late because they lost track of time. For the kids, they would have more time to make plans and to hang out with friends. They wouldnt have to wait on a parent to get to their house to pick them up, because their parent is at work. The cars could also help with car pooling if needed they could find the fastest rute to pick up everyone in the group. These are some of the reasons that driverless cars could give parent and kids more freedom.

Driverless cars could also help with safety. For example it would help with drunk driving. The cars are driverless so the intoxenanated person would not be driving, and it would get the person home safely and without putting other people in danger. These cars could also help in dangerous weather, instead of people driving the same speeds in bad weather the car could take them a good speed for the condutions on the road.

Driverless cars give parents and kids more free time and can help keep the roads safe. Kids could do more things with their friends, parents could have somemore time to themselves relaxing at home, there would be a decrease in drunk drivers, and it would help keep people safe in bad weather. This is why driverless cars will be halpful in the future.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some students despise being in class all day long and are always complaining about coming to school. As technology is getting better everyday, an opportunity has come where students can be taught at the comfort of their own home. Teaching online has become a new way for students to stay focused and on track while staying at home. Either through video call or online course learning, it is a easy way for teachers to get the information we need to us, and students to able to comprehend the information easily. Distance learning is a new and easy way for students to learn because they will be able to be in a comfortable learning environment; furthermore, the students would also always be on time and ready to work because of how advanced technology has become.

Students will be able to be in a comfortable working environment; as a result, they will be focused and on track with all of their work. School can be very fast paced and hectic getting to all the classes on time and ready to learn. The hallways are crowded and loud, and the very next minute you could be taking a very important test. Some students believe that it is very difficult to be running around the school and trying to focus in class. Being at home in a quiet place before taking an important test, or just learning information, is far better than being in a crowded area and trying to focus on your work.

With technology becoming more advanced, getting to these classes would be very fast and students will always have access to it. Students would also be on time to these classes because they won't have to leave their own home. Teachers would also find it very beneficial because it is a lot of one on one time with the student. Teachers and students would always be working together and the students will have the best opportunity to learn without any interruptions. Aside from technology, another reason why online school would be beneficial is that students skip meals during the day at school because they may not have time or may not want to pack a lunch. With online courses, students can eat healthy meals and exercise in their free time which will lead to a healthy lifestyle for the students.

Although there are many benefits to online classes, many people are skeptical about this. People believe that students will get distracted in their own home by video games, YouTube, or the internet. This may be true because many high school students get distracted easily but this could be where parental ad vision comes to help. Parents could set boundaries on when to use video games and the internet. This would help the students by not being tempted to distractions and the students would focus on school. Another reason why people appose distance learning is that students won't get the face to face talking ability with teachers. This could be solved by video chat and one on one help by the programs that can be run with the new technology.

Online courses is a new way for students to learn and stay focused. Students will be in a better learning environment and they will be on time and ready to learn everyday with new technology. Students aren't the only ones benefiting, teachers will also have time to help the students one on one which will be the best opportunity to learn. Online courses should become a learning tool because the benefits are too great to pass up on.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principal:

I am writing this because I think that all of the students and maybe some teachers should do some community service. I am asking you to make a speech in front of the school to motivate us to do some community service. I am hoping you will understand why!

First of all, community service gives us the opportunity to commit ourselves to something. We can all do something whether it is picking up trash, volunteering at a hospital or children's center, or tutoring someone. None of these are hard we just have to set our mind on making our community a better place.

We are all capable of doing something, but we decide to not try and do nothing about it. I think this is very important that if we get everyone motivated on doing community service then we will see a change in this community for the better. By doing a few ours after school will make us stronger and we will be a team. This will help us respect each others differences. Also it will give us an opportunity to meet and get to know some other people better.

To me this is going to change the way we look at other people and help us realize we have a lot more than we think we do. The problem is there are some stubborn people in the school that won't want to help that is why we need some inspiration and someone to really motivate us. I am not quite sure how we can motivate everyone. That is why I am asking for help and input from you.

I really hope you take this thought into consideration. You will see a change in our school! It may be hard at first but I know this will work! We will defiantly need some support from others to keep us on our feet and thinking positively! Thank you for you time.

Sincerely, one of your students      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Phones & Driving Essay

I believe that drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving because it is an attention hazzard. Driving with your phone in hand is not only illegal but very dangerous, but driving without the distraction of a phone can lower the driving fatality rates by a lot. Also, there are apps and programs on the phones that help drivers go hands free. Last, having that phone as a distraction while driving can cause a significant lowering of you reaction time and attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

First and foremost, Driving without the phone as a distraction will generally lower the fatality rates of distracted driving accidents. Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of self-control is the reason why people get distracted by their phones, especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents.

Furthermore, Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people, objects, and other cars on the road, with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident. Also, looking for pedestrians crossing while distracted just makes driving harder than it has to be.

Finally, There are various things that have been put in place to keep the driver from getting distracted by their phones, For example apps and programs on the phones that keep the driver from checking or responding to their phones. It prevents the driver from getting phone calls, texts, and other notifications while in the car. Another example, the hands-free laws that hold the people that like to drive with phone in hand accountable. Last is personal accountability, keeping yourself in check and safe but not just yourself but the people in the car with you and the other cars.

In conclusion, Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot, there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts, but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road, and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

"The concept of summer break presents many flaws to the school system. It causes students to lose vital information they learned the year prior and creates a lazy atmosphere with the absence of work. The clear solution to this is summer assignments and projects, yet some wonder who deserves to decide what the projects should consist of. Summer projects, a key tool to ensure continued enrichment, should be student designed to allow opportunities for creativity, increased enjoyment while working, as well as higher rates of motivation to continuously work on the project in order to nurture passion and a love for this work within students.

During the school year teachers are obligated to obtain a set amount of grades and fit a certain curriculum, yet during summer these rules no longer apply. This leaves summer as the perfect time to allow for creativity with learning. One such example is the Sustainable Technology Class. This is a project driven class where students are given guidelines to fulfill and that is it. Many of the students taking this course have a passion for the material and need a chance to see all of the possibilities it can hold. With this class specific, originality could lead to a revolutionary invention, such as electricity generating bicycles or solar powered toys. Through this experience a student can truly fall in love with the world of science and decide to create a career out of it. A cpncept very similar to professors being able to do any research they can get approved within their budget. Also, including student led work could help school systems break the factory system pattern of the school year in which you do your assigned work and keep the classroom silent. Our current system, where students have very little say, easily leads to anxiety, exhaustion, and eventually, for some, fully dropping out of high school. By offering a chance to have a self designed, teacher approved project, students can fully appreciate knowledge in a way the benefits the individual.

Once the door to creativity and choice has been opened, enjoyment has to follow. In 1800's France, a new style of art was emerging, impressionism. If these talented and famous painters, such as Monet and Van Gogh, solely followed the advice of their instructors and refused to step out to paint what they enjoy, we would not have beautiful works like Starry Night. If they had not branched out and followed their intuition and joy, they may never have continued painting due to constant belittlement of the art style they preferred. Our museums would be repetitions of the same work with very little diversity. This is true for essentially all art, another example of this is the Rock Revolution. If stars such as Elvis and the Beatles only followed the era of Big Band music and never were allowed to play and create what they enjoyed, music could have never evolved. With each generation, the world learns more and more. Advancements would never occur if every project was solely based off of the knowledge of the teacher.

Finally, for the average student, September through June is an endless pattern of early mornings, tests, and work sheets created by their teachers. More importantly September through June is a pattern of procrastination for many students. Due to dread about a certain assignment or just plain boredom, work piles up and leaves the student to rush through it carelessly before the due date. A perfect example of this is Love Canal, New York. In the 1970's a community was built over a former dumping ground for radioactive waste. The families quickly noticed issues such as minor chemical burns from the grass and black sludge seeping into their houses, but the government ignored the growing tragedy. There was no action taken until 18 out of 21 children were born with severe chromosomal defects. By this point, the government was forced to spend thousands of dollars in relocating the families as well as reparations, hospital bills, and environmental recovery. If they had not procrastinated, then it would have been considerably less expensive and would not have been as horrific as it ended up being. While this example may not directly highlight the issues within teacher driven projects, it does show what a consistent habit of procrastination can lead to. Which is what the school system instills in students by not allowing decision making. It is undeniable that when people care about the project being done, they are will put time and energy into it through out the whole experience, not just the ending.

While there are some benefits to teacher driven projects, such as the possibility for concise instructions and often an obvious path to follow, these just allow the students to be overly protected and lazy. This prevents the potential for growth that comes from creating something and succeeding in it without the help of an adult. It also instills the idea that there will always be someone telling you what to do. Which is very harmful once these students get to the work field. They will be unprepared due to never doing fully original and individual work, and the school system would be the one to blame.

In our modern world, we need innovation more than anything else. Young minds need to be nurtured, but also allowed to follow their own path of individuality and creativity. The only way to ensure the growth of these important traits is to loosen the leash and allow students to make some of the decisions. It is just one project per year, but a country wide switch could be revolutionary. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Imagine you are applying for your dream job. You are preparing for your interview, but you are not sure how to answer a potential question. Only asking your friend might not give you the best answer to the question. But if you ask multiple people that are in the same field as you, they might answer your question the best. When there is a decision to be made, it is always important to ask more than one individual for advice because it helps you know all the possible solutions, avoid bias, and learn from others' past experiences. These different opinions will assist you in making the best choice.

Talking to different sources allows you to understand the different options fully. You need to understand every option by knowing the pros and cons before you make your decision. This helps you understand what your getting into depending on the options. I was asked to be on a basketball team that traveled around the country. I talked with my coach, parents, and family about the offer. Their opinions helped me learn the pros and cons of this opportunity. This allowed me to know what I was going to be doing if I accepted the offer. From their assistance I was able to make a choice that benefited me and my family.

If only one opinion is heard, your answer would lean toward their bias or your own. All people have a bias that is favored in some situations. It is human nature! These thoughts can be pushed aside though. The simple solution is asking multiple people for advice. It sounds easy, but most of the time, we still make the same mistake. We put our personal thoughts in the way of making the best decision.

Some people have experienced the same situation as you, and their past decision can help you make the better choice. We can learn from their mistake or build off their previous choice. Again, the only way to learn these stories is to ask more than one person for advice. People that base their advice from what they have experienced normally have a good reason for a certain solution. People do have different experiences, though. This is important to know so that we can see the differences and similarities of their past. Their opinion might strengthen your own and give a reason to choose a different option.

We all want to make the right choice when we come across a problem. The only way to do this is to ask multiple people for advice. Asking more than one individual helps us know the options, stay away from bias, and learn from others' past experiences. Once we do this, it is our turn to choose what is the best choice. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I agree students should participate in extracurricular activities during school ,

students need a break sometimes to enjoy what they think is fun no matter if it's sports or helping students with work or helping the school and teachers even if its bringing supply, students should have a choice to pick what they want to do in school, of course it must be school appropriate but students should be able to pick what they want not have principals and teachers pick what they think or want them to do students should be able to pick something there passionate about what makes them want come to school.

I said what makes them want to come to school because some students are miserable when they come to school, they feel like they hate school and they dont want to be there students get in trouble more because they don't want to be there they need something to look forward to, by having extra curricular activities during school they will look forward to something they enjoy they'll have a more positive attitude because there doing something they are passionate about something they like to do to keep them occupied by doing this students will want to come to school more.

Some activities should be with multiple people working with multiple people, not only does this build character and leadership skills but it helps with social skills which helps students communicate more so when students get upset with teachers they can walk away from the problem and not talk back instead of them taking there anger out on teachers this is why students get into trouble, they dont know how to walk away from a situation or they dont know how to accept defeat that they cant win a argument with an adult students shouldn't even be arguing with adults but sometimes they feel like there right and the teacher is wrong, students don't know how to communicate with there peers by having competitive activities they'll learn to walk away from a problem they'll eventually get tired of arguing or they'll accept defeat, although there's no guarantee teachers can always teach the students with competitive games like checkers or a thinking game they get beat to many times so they quit.

Some students need to communicate or need human interaction some students are worried they dont fit in so they don't talk to people and some people cant make friends as well as others so they dont talk to people much this is where students may get diagnosed with illnesses like depression from being bullied or other hardships they have to face in there life as people we dont know what everybody goes threw, some people aren't comfortable with telling people ether they keep it bottled in and they dont get out much, this is why we need team building activities so those people could fit in and get around with people make friends too the more they work together they build trust and a bond as team.

So yes I agree with the statement that was made because it betters us as people so we should have extracurricular activities to better the education and improve the attitude of students and maybe more students would show up again maybe not everybody will agree or like my idea but that's my opinion to better our education so take it into consideration.     ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Senator,

I think that we should change over to election by popular vote. I thinks that because in the Electoral College the voters dont vote on the president, but instead they vote on the electors who then vote for the president. ""It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense....it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. There are five reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are preactical, not liberal or conservative reasons. Some people disagree though they think that we should stick with the electoral college. They think its a good way to do the voting because they get to choose the electors who will choose our president. Inconclusion, I think that we should do election by popular vote because then the voters get to choose the president.

"Phones and Driving

In 1973, the first handheld cell phone was made. 23 years later, the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public. Cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented, and today people rely on them for more than just communication. Smartphones. For instance, can do anything you can imagine, and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them. In fact, people use their cell phones practically 24/7. People text on the toilet, stream music in the shower, and unfortunately, use their phones while driving. This is probably the worst thing about cell phones. Phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults. 1.6 million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving. No one, not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving.

It's not always easy to control a vehicle. Weather conditions, traffic, and other people make driving very difficult sometimes. If you add the distraction of a cell phone, driving is 10 times more difficult to focus on. You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life.

Another important reason why operating a phone while driving should be prohibited involves other drivers as well as passengers that may ride in your car. When someone rides in your vehicle, whether its a friend or your child, you are responsible for them. By using your phone at the wheel, you put both you and your passengers at risk of injury or even death. You also put the strangers driving beside you at risk. Texting and driving doesn't just risk you. Most fatal car crashes involve more than one car. If you don't want to live with the fact that you hurt someone you love or even just a stranger, using your phone while driving shouldn't be an option.

Lastly, in some states, using your phone while driving is illegal and can cost you a lot of money. In georgia, for instance, holding a cellphone while not parked, or even pressing one button on a phone can get you a ticket. With each offense, the fines get larger. It's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message. Additionally, if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions, such as texting and driving, you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to 20 years. Texting and driving tickets, if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for, will greatly increase your insurance rates, making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive. Unless you have a money tree in your backyard and don't mind ridiculous insurance for the rest of your life, its best to wait until you get home to use your phone.

In conclusion, it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea. Nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel. The best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road. You risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle.. You risk your life, your friends life, strangers lives, and even the money in your pocket. The only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency. Otherwise, the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world. Statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car. Phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle.

"First of all studying venus isn't a bad idea wanting to explore the deepest point of venus can change history and life, we can figure out many secrets that venus has and what kind of life form could be on venus because in every planet their's always something that hasn't been discovered. Venus is a planet that will soon be explored NASA has been sending spacecrafts to land on venus but they still don't make it,

For three decades many factors contribute to venus reputation and has been a challenge for humans to study, even thoe 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we expirence on earth those conditions are way to extreme that humans don't encounter that on earth

Another reason why it should be studied more and have future plans that someday people from NASA will land is that because many astronomers believe that venus may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system and that venus was onced probably covered largely with oceans and could've been many forms of life in venus many many years ago.

Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that. many researchers are working on innovations that will allow machines to last longer so they can get enough samples for them.

Overall i think that finding new ways to explore and studie venus is a great idea i think that will change history maybe in the future venus can become our second home if we find out more about it and venus will soon be an explored planet and hope that will continue with other planets.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"""The more technology we have the more knowledge we loose. The more technology we have the more lazy we get."" Cars could fundamentaly change the world. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both postive and negative aspects of driveless cars. Driverless cars have a more negative aspect than a positive aspect because it can cause many accidents, they're expensive and they are too smart.

Driverless cars are faster than any other car ,a lot of people are facinated with them but the fact that these cars can steer, accelerate and brake themselves can cause many accidents. These driveless cars dont drive through work zones and around accidents. The car will require the human's attention whenever there's a problem. if the techonology fails whose fault is it? the drive or the manufacturer?

One of the biggest concerns about driveless cars is that they're really expensive baecause they have many expensive sensors;sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camara mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors and a GPS. imagine how much all of these things could cost? very expensive and what if one day you wake up and the car doesnt work? imagine how expesive it is going to be to fix it.

Lastly, Driveless cars are too smart. They have a very advanced technology. They have all thse sensors and too much technology can be very dangerous for humans, tis technology is not nessesary for hiumans.

in Conclusion, Driveless cars can be very dangerous but a a lot people would love to buy them just for the simply fact that it can be more practical, that way the dont have to drive to store if they dont want to or to their jobs or even to another state. There is only four states that have approved the use of this cars. Manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars proved more reliably safe.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Senator,

It is the peoples right to vote on who represents our country, but why vote if you cannot choose the the direct candidate you want? I demand the electoral college to be abolished, it is a violation of the peoples right to vote for who they want. It is enough nonsesne of voting for someone to vote for you. Popular vote is the fairest way to vote, in lines 24 though 31 of the text, it exclaims that state committee's and candidates pick the electors. So candidates choose the electors that the people vote for? How do we know the candidates or committee's aren't sabataushing their power and picking the people they opinionly want, as opposed to whomever? We don't!

With the electoral college exsisting we are giving our power to other poeple that can vote for us. We are handing them free votes, so they can vote for who'm they'd like. That is not fair! They say that the most powerful person in the world is the people, but with the electoral college it has partially been robbed. In lines 26 through 27 of the text that supports the electoral college it states that ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" That sentence proves to you that the people are incontrol of voting for their president.

Yes people may say that without the electoral college favoritism may appear in certain states and places. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that! There may be more voters for one candidate in a certain place, but as long as the people voted for whom they want there is no injustice.

In lines 17 through 18 of the text that supports the electoral college it states "" that trust is rarely betrayed."" RARELY? Meaning wrongful doing has happened between the lines of the electoral college, and are likely to happen again...Do not be blind to the electoral college's purpose. It is damaging the voting for our presidential election. Popular voting, where all equals and powers vote for the president they want.

"When asking for advice, it is always best to receive different viewpoints from multiple people. Asking for that advice supports the decision maker by giving them options based on the advisers' viewpoints. Furthermore, it educates the mind of the decision maker for future references related to that topic. In addition to being educated, it gives them an idea of what others may think of the topic. They can then make inferences about the person based on that advice.

Giving the decision maker more viewpoints to look at lets them have a better idea of what they would like to know. When someone asks others for the viewpoints of an idea, they are likely to tell that person what they believe about the idea. The advice may be vitally important to their decision, or irrelevant in all ways. That is why getting advice from multiple beings helps the decision maker when making their decision, simply because it narrows down their options, based on what they also believe on that topic. For example, if someone is trying to make a decision, they are most likely going to ask multiple people for options. Then, using those options, they would make a decision based on what they believe is best for them.

Seeking multiple options also makes the decision maker more educated for future discussions and references related to or based off of that topic. From the advice given to them from multiple people, they are able to make suggestions and hopefully give advice to others to help them with their decision making. That advice may be vital to the decision maker's life, only because it would make them more intelligent for the betterment of their well-being. Nevertheless, the information given to them could be used to educate themselves and others in the future.

When asking for advice, the decision maker also gets to know more about the person they are asking. For example, if a person asks someone what they think about an idea, the adviser would most likely tell them what they believe. As a result, it causes the decision maker have an idea on what the adviser thinks about a central thought or belief. Then, using that information, the decision maker can make inferences about how that person thinks or what they believe. That information can be very important because the decision maker could decide to ask that person for advice more frequently, depending on what they think of them or their advice.

Getting advice is always useful in life, given the fact that it can use in many different ways. First of all, getting advice from multiple people can influence the decisions of someone in need of it. The advice given could support the decision maker's viewpoints, or oppose of it. However, the opposing advice could positively influence the decision maker. They could become influenced based on the supporting details of their reason to believe in what they think. Next, the advice given to the decision maker could educate their mind in many different ways. If they want to use the advice given to them in the future, they would most likely want to use the best advice received, therefore, try and get as much advice as they can so they have a plethora of options to choose from when they want to use this to their knowledge in the future. Finally, the decision maker can get to know more about someone, especially the person advising them. The decisions made by someone are usually based off of the information given by others. The decision maker gets an idea of how someone thinks and what they believe in from the advice given to them, and they can then use that information to make inferences on that person. Hopefully, the information about the adviser created by the decision maker will be beneficial to the decision maker.",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Dear Senate,

It is only fair to the people of America to change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. The process of the Electoral vote seems to leave out votes and make them seem less improtant, and that right there is discriminating the peoples right. Millions of people in each state vote for a president but then out of all those votes only 34 electoral votes would consist, and that's if your electors win the statewide election. If not then your canidate already loses votes from your whole state.

Although, they're are some reasons for retaining the Electoral College. A canidate would need trans-reginal appeal not just the appeal of one region.

Last, pressure from run-off elections when a candidate doesn't win majority vote is subsided by the Electoral College.

However, the College Electoral process has more cons then pros.  With the electoral college system voters vote for the slate of electors not president. Millions of votes casted in each state are practically forgotten about after one of the electors win the statewide election. How is it that millions of votes only count as 34 electoral votes? Peoples opinons do matter and each one of them need to be heard. The winner-take-all system is just not fair to voters and needs to change.

They ask people for advice but it isnt very good so, they ask multiple of their friends or family for many different opinions to see which is best. So yes seeking multiple opinions or advice is a great idea because, you can get many point of views, multiple ideas of what good or bad things can happen, get a bunch of support from new friends or old friends.

One reason, is asking people for multiple point of views so you can hear their side of their stories . When you ask for advice you obviously want one that has a good outcome. Well many people go through the same thing but solve it in many different ways, which can have a good or bad outcome. So when you ask your friends or family they can have many ideas of what you should do. They can help you on what or what not to do since it might or might not be your first experience with your situation.

One other reason, is you can get many opinions, ideas, or advice from wise people. If you ask a lot of people for advice they will give you multiple ideas. If you get a lot advice you can test them all out and see which one has the best outcome. For example, there was this one girl who was getting bullied and she didn't ask anybody for help and the first thing that came to her mind was to fight the person who was bulling her. She was the one who ended up getting in trouble when she could've asked her friends for help. But she learned to ask people for advice so she could choose the best option.

Finally, when you ask someone for advice they might not know what to do so they send you to ask someone who might not be your friend but has gone through the same thing. That can lead you to making new friendships since they might be curious on whats going on. They might even know the specifics of your situation which can lead to them giving you better advice since they might want the best got you. Asking someone for advice good advice can help you find out who are your true friends depending on what they say since they can give you good or bad advice. You'll find out who the trustworthy one are and they can be the ones to help you make a better choice on your situation.

In conclusion, getting lots of advice is best since out of all of them you can choose the best one and have a good outcome based on what people told you. They can help you get through the difficult times and might even give you comfort and hope on your situation. It can give you ideas of what right or wrong or what you know what can or not happen. But overall getting a lot of advice from many people can also show they care so you know if anything bad happens there will be people by your side. So yes seeking multiples opinions can help you make a better choice.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Phones and Driving

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over the past two decades phones and technology have expanded and so have the dangers of getting behind the wheel with a cellular device. I believe that no one has a reason to be doing anything other than driving when in a vehicle. Cellular devices have become a major issue whether you're a senior citizen or a beginner at driving.

Over the past few years that technology has expanded into many forms more and more casualties have occurred on the roads. The United States Department of Transportation reported that cell phones are involved in about 1.6 million auto crashes each year meaning that these 1.6 million car crashes involved cellular devices being a distraction to drivers. Some of the cell phone related car crashes lead to deaths of the distracted drivers and even the people who weren't even behind the wheel. There are many different ways to be distracted by a cellular device. This includes texting, maps, email, and social media.

Emotions over text messages could also effect a driver's state of mind while driving. If a driver were to get mad or upset over something they saw or read they could get distracted and lose control of the vehicle. Also could affect others that are driving. Other drivers could be in danger if someone can't see because they are distracted texting someone back. Overall this means that emotions could overcome someone if they used a cellular device while driving.

The law in Georgia is called the hands free law in my own words I think of this as both hands on the wheel. This is the way that drivers should drive all the time with both hands on the wheel. Using one hand to call someone could cause you to not be able to react in an emergency. If an animal jumped in front of a car of someone using a hand to see the map on their phone for directions it could lead them to crashing and harming the animal because of the panic and only one hand to steer. I think that both hands is an important safety when it comes to driving.

These three major points support my reason as to why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices behind the wheel. Emotion effecting the capability of someone driving, casualties because of distractions caused by cellular devices and, two free hands that will make the possibilities of crashing slim to none.

"I think that the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enableing the computers to identify human emotions is'nt valuable at all. Especially not for students in a classrom. I say this because students moods in a classroom can change, in a matter of seconds because the teacher may give out extra work or it was a hard day for the student. Also kids don't always show their emotions.

Let's get a little bit more into this. I'm not completly sure why this facial exspression system seem's like a good idea. Maybe because the people who thought about it thought it would be a smart and great idea to know peoples emotions. If you can already tell by ""facial"" exspressions why need this machine system? It would be a waste of money to make everywhere.

People may show their mood by their facial exspressions but others might not. Some don't even show their emotions. Others may even have that natural ""mean/angry"", ""happy/funny"", or even the ""sad/depressed"" facial look.

This is why I think it would'nt be much of a good idea. It costs to much and might not even be worth it.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The Seagoing Cowboys is a program, and its main goal is to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. This might not sound fun or interesting. These trips might be half-year long trips, but the trips are life-changing experiences. I'll show you reasons why to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. These reasons are coming from a person who has joined the Seagoing Cowboys and served for three years.

The first reason is because of the experience you'll gain from the trips. The trips are life-changing. You have the benefits of traveling the world. You get to see and do a lot of things an average person wouldn't do. You get to see Europe, China, and Greece, and many other beautiful places. You might even take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy or pass the Panama Canal. The experience is an amazing one.

These trips can cheer you up. Like I said before, you get to travel to amazing places and do amazing things. These might sound like fun things to do, because they are. You might ask how you have fun while on the ship in the sea. You can play table-tennis, fencing, boxing, baseball, volleyball, or any other games that helped pass time. You have a lot of fun during the trips. At the same time, you're helping peope and other countries and serving as military service.

Last but not least, you are more aware of the world. The trips open the world up to you. You're more aware of people of other countries and their needs. This awareness can change your life.

All in all, the Seagoing Cowboys is a great program to join. It's an opportunity of a lifetime. On these trips, you're gaining experience. You're visiting a lot of places and having a lot of fun.

"Everyone has dreamed about aliens living on mars at least once in their life. As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on mars, there is no evidnece today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. The Face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the Face here on Earth.

When analyzing a digital image, you can dicern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars.

Here on Earth we have many different types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures? There is no evidence that proves the Face could have been created by alien life forms.

In conclusion, although everyone here on Earth would love to discover that the Face was created by aliens, there is no evidence that can prove that theory. There are not any alien markings and there are landforms on Earth that look very similar to the Face on Mars. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"So if your principal wanted you too at least participate in one extracurricular activity do you agree or disagree with his choice. In my opinion I disagree with his decision because not all people like to be apart of clubs or sports teams some people like to just do their work and e done with school. Then their is the kids that are really good at sports and other things like taking photo's and playing board games but not all students are good at sports and board games.

I believe that if students don't want to take an extracurricular activity then they don't have to and if they wanted to take one they would take one I don't think that they should be forced to take an extracurricular activity because some people on the sports team could make fun of the because their not as good as the other players and if they took any other one's no one knows how other people would act if their was new people or if they didn't like them.

Some might say that extracurricular activity's could help students meet new people or gain social skills but it could also make them feel that they don't fit in of they are forced to do something that they don't want to do. If the principal forces students to join a sports team or any other thing like yearbook club they might not like it and because they are forced to do it they might start to lose respect for the principal and the other staff at the school. All in all I think that students shouldn't be forced to join and extracurricular activity if they don't want too became they could start to feel pressured to do good and practice a lot for it and fall behind in school.

So, if students are pressured to do good in their extra curricular activity and fall behind in school they will get bad grades and might get help back a grade and that wouldn't be good because other student's would most likely bully him. When someone get's bullied it isn't good for their self confidence or their self esteem and when someone starts to get bullied they become very mad.

Some students might like to be in the extracurricular activity's because their athletic or smart or also they just enjoy being apart of a team or club but not all students enjoy that so if you make them join one they can get stressed because they don't like being around a lot of people or they could also get scared if they have social anxiety.

Some would say that students need to learn to work together and be a good person in general but forcing them to take an extracurricular activity is not the way to help them to be better people and to teach them how to work together as a team. If you force them they will not know eachother and won't work that well as a team.

Instead of making them take an extracurricular activity you should motivate them to do it if you force them they won't like it but if you motivate them a friend group might go join a club or sports team and if they join they will actually enjoy it and not hate it. Because if your forced to do it your most likely to hate it and not enjoy it and if they enjoy it they are more likely to want to keep doing it every year.

In the end i don't think that students should have to take an extracurricular activity because if someone is forced to do something that they don't want to they will start to get careless and not want to do anything and will start to fall ina slump and stop doing well in school.

If they had a club for every person then I think that I would agree with itbut I think that it would be too hard for them to have a seperate club for every student in the school. But even if they did have a club for every student I don't think that every student would want to be in a club.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"If you like to be with animals such as horses than we would sure have a fun time on the SS Charles W. Wooster. We have to help the animals that are being shiped over seas like horses, cattle, and mules.

In the empty stals the horese, cattle, and mules aren't in we play games like baceball and volleyball they had table tennis tournaments, fencing tournaments, boxing tournaments, they read, and other games that would help pass the time.

"Image having to do a activity for school. Your principal is making everyone do an activity and it is not good because some kids need rest and some do not like to do and kind of sport or activity. Also kids need time to relax and do things they want to do.

Kids need rest because they already do lots of work and they need to have energy to do any activity. Also kids like to rest and not do activity's resting make them do activity's so they need to rest. Kids like to hang out with there friends and talk when they do activity's they will not be able to talk to each other and hang out is like resting because they are not going to run and do stuff they like having fun talking to each other. resting is a good thing for kids because they need energy for other stuff.

A lot of kids like to play indoors and not do activity's. kids like to play video games with friends and they have fun. Also there are kids that dont like going outside and like staying in inside they can read play games play with friends because they might have not any interest in anything or not might have many friends to play with in an activity. Kids don't like doing stuff that have to do with activitys they like doing there own thing.

"In certain schools they have a required summer project that is either teacher designed or student designed.

My position is the students should design these project because students have a bigger imagination, and if we create the project we're more likely to do it. I will get into more detail as i continue.

Some schools require a summer project, and my position states that students should design these projects because students have a bigger imagination than teachers. My reasoning for that statement is we're still young and we see stuff more different than adults. For example picture a little boy and a forty year old man the little boy imagination is something you wouldn't expect, and the old man imagination and creativity isn't really on point like the little boy. But the little boy has all these ideas that one day can save the world, my point is you expanding your mind just a little bit can produce one of the best ideas. Which is why i think students should design these projects because of our imagination which can expand into a different realm and create a great idea for a project which more students would want to do because a student created it and the creativity put into it will attract us students.

Therefor If students created this project we are going to more likely want to do it. Because the fact that the students created it that alone would push students to want to do it more. Seeing your peers create a project that you can relate too would also push you to do it. Us younger people use social media as a outlet to sell things etc... but if we put the project design on social media, and catch our peers attention and they like it. More and more students would complete or at least try because of the creativity and it was a peer telling you, not no commanding teacher.

I would choose students to create this summer project design. Because the fact that if a peer put it out there and is creating it we're more likely going to do it. We think differnet we reach into the non reality part of life and make it reality. I also agree with the fact that our imagination is way bigger then teachers because what were used to seeing on television etc.. anything could be possible from what we've seen so far in our life.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Have you ever been assigned a summer project by your teacher? Imagine if you, the student, could design the project. A student-designed project would allow students to base the project off of their personal traits or hobbies, unlike a teacher-designed project. Some argue that summer projects should be student-designed, but others believe it should be teacher-designed. A student-designed project is better than a teacher-designed project because it allows students to incorporate their personal values and it gives students the opportunity to make new friendships.

Students are able to incorporate their personal values in a student-designed project, unlike in a teacher-designed project. Incorporating personal values makes the project more intriguing and fun for students, and it will prevent students from going through the motions while completing the project. For example, in

The Crucible by Arthur Miller, John Proctor is accused of witchcraft. He is found guilty after his trial and is forced to sign a document that states he used witchcraft to bestow evil on the town of Generic_City. John refuses to sign the document believing that it will cast a bad look on his name. This shows the importance of personal values and how they impacted John's decision. A student-designed project allows for students to create a project based on their personal values, which will make the project more meaningful and important to the student.

A student-designed project is better than a teacher-designed project because it allows students to connect with one another through collaborating on an idea for the project. A teacher-designed project does not allow for such collaboration. For example, in

Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Clarisse McClellan and Guy Montag create a unique friendship by sharing their ideas about the society that they are living in. At first Guy is very timid around Clarisse, but by sharing their ideas of the world around them they become very close. This shows how collaborating on a shared idea can create a friendship. In a student-designed project this is achievable because students will be interacting with each other to design a project.

Many people believe that a teacher-designed project is better than a student-designed project because students could take advantage of a student-designed project, but that just isn't the case. A student-designed project allows for students to incorporate their personal values and gives them the opportunity to create new friendships. Summer projects should be student-designed, don't allow teacher-designed projects to take away a great opportunity for students to learn something new about themselves or their peers. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The author supports the claim in a very understandable factor. It plays a part in the story to inform you more knowledge about Venus.

"Phones and Driving

Many people text while driving or call while driving. Snap chat is the most used app by teens while driving, mainly to show off that they are in their new car, or to show that they are out somewhere. Some talk while driving holding the phone up to their ear driving with one hand on the phone and one on the wheel. Others face time still driving with one hand holding the phone to their face and the other one the wheel. Some text while driving with one hand on the phone and the other on the wheel. Others use the hands free were people can just talk into the phone, and tell the phone what to send in text. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

One reason why people should not use cell phones while driving is they could get in a car crash. ""The national safety council reported that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year,"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates). People using their cell phones while driving have one hand on the wheel, and one on the phone causing less control of the wheel. Also some people crash their car due to looking at their phone trying to text, call, or take a picture or video of themselves. Driving and using a cell phone could be dangerous and can lead someone into a car crash.

Another reason why people should not use cell phones while driving is they could get pulled over by the police for the use of texting driving. This will cause the driver to get their license suspended, or lose it. ""Nearly 390,000injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving,"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates). Police try to pull people over before there can be a possibility of an accident happening. People think that police are being too strict when they pull people over for texting and driving, but they just want to help people out before it is no other person in the world to save.

On the other hand, others may go against, and say that Drivers should be able to text and drive. For example if people learn how to text and drive there will be less accidents. In that learning process people can crash the car from being too cautious do to slamming on the breaks trying to stop. Learning how to text and drive is more dangerous than getting stuck at the top of a rollercoaster. Therefore, people should not text a drive ever.

Cell phones should not be at use while driving ever. More people are being killed by it, and others are losing their licenses from it. Texting and driving is not worth losing someone's life, or worth going to jail over. Texting and driving is a big danger and can lead to many bad out comes at the end.          ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal,

There has been a lot of talk going around about if you're going to decide to require community service or not. So, I decided to write this letter to you hoping it will make your decision a little easier. I would agree, that there is a lot of controversy over this issues.

My opinion on this issue is to require community service to all of the students of our school. Community Service is just helping out the community, but its also helping out helping the person doing the service. The individual student may not realize it, but community make the place THEY live in a better society. If it didn't it would be called, world service. Everyone doing a little bit can make a big impact in our community.

Some students may say ""but, I just don't have time"". In most cases this is a lie. What these kids are saying is, on a rough estimation, in 3,600 hour school year the don't have just 10 hours of that time to give back to their community? I find that pretty hard to believe, and I hope you would to. I have to agree that students lives are very full these days, but the can make time for their community that makes there lives full. On my opinion on refusing to do community service is either the person is lazy, or just plain mean. The students may not realize it not, but community is definitely worth their time. After doing community service, the students will have a satisfying feeling, knowing they did something good, and benefited their community. You never know, they just might like community service.

I want to thank you for reading this letter and hearing what I have to say and my opinion on community service. I hope this letter will make your decision a little less stressful, either option you pick. You do a great at your job and I know you'll make your decision for the better of the school. Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely,

Your student      ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear, Principle

I think that you should ask the students of our school to volunteer for the work of community service. This is easier because if you make community service a school requirement you will have complaints from the student's parents of making their child work in community service.

The volunteers will actually help you in working with you to help our city be a better cleaner place, or help the people who actually need the help you give to them. For example, the great state of Louisiana still needs help recovering from Hurricane Katrina, maybe you could make that a school field trip for the volunteers at our school to do some community service there. I know I would fell good helping all the parents and children get food, water, fresh clothing, and more.

Another thing you can make a school field trip is, go to Africa to help the people in starvation there, it would help their self concisions to have a full stomach and a full year supply of food and water there to. Yes the flights will be expensive, but I am willing to guess that 2 or 3 of our students, including me, will go with you to help those innocent people.

Another suggestion is just run a fundraiser for all the kids in our school to donate some food or water, canned goods, shirts, shoes, pants, even underwear for these people to use.

Thank you, if you have any questions, please write me back at the return address.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME

P.S.

you should also look in to joining the salvation army to help out other people here in our city, make sure you get some kids to join to, they might want to help also, and tell them to ask their friends to join the salvation army, the more the marryer!!",0,persuade_corpus,1
"What is Venus? In paragraph one, Venus is the closest planet to earth and often they known as Earth's ""Twin."" And according to the article, Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any planet in our solar system. A thick atmoshphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venus also has similar features to Earth. Such as Mountains, valleys, craters and others.

According to the author, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the troubles it may presents. In the article from paragraph five, The National Aeronautics and Space administration known as ""NASA"" has an interesting idea of sending humans to study more about Venus. They allow scientist to float above the fray while seeing the rolling Venusian landscape. Just as how jet airplanes fly at the higher attitude, passing the storms and also that way, they could stay safe far away from Venu's surface area. Since it is dangerous to be on Venus surface area, researchers could not take any samples of rock, or gas, or anything that's on the planet.

In conclusion, it is a worthy exploration and it is somewhat important to learn more about Venus. So that way, we could also discover things that we haven't yet discover and study from it. As it said on the article, in the very last paragraph, Venus is challenging to all of us. Because not only the facts that it attracts scientist and researchers out there, it also lead human curiosity to explore more about it.       ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Is it a good ideal for student to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing? I think this act has an advantage and disadvantage because, it help students understand what they are learning, it waste time and it expensive to afford, students do a lot of research.

First, distance learning from home or by online or video conferencing help student to undrestand what they are learning. When student learn online or video conferencing, it helps the student get more knowledge about what they are learning and ask questions about what they dont understand. Example people normally feel shy especially teenagers to talk or ask question in public. This online or video conference will help the student to able to ask questions and understand what he or she is learning.

Again, distance learning from home or online or video conference waste time and it expensive to afford .A lot of students have jobs so they are unable to take class, such student will have to engage in distance learning through online or video conferencing to improve his or her grade. Example some students take care of themselves, so he or she has to work and pay the bills. However, video conference and online waste money because some of the students do not drive. They have to take Uber from home to class,which is expensive but the video conferencing and online is easy to afford.

Lastly,distance learning through online or video conferencing helps students to do a lot of research. This act helps students to do a lot of research and discover an information about what they dont know and what they want to know more. Example when the students are learning,they may come across a word or phrase or sentence that they may not be familiar with it. This gives them the opportunity to do a lot of research about it. Through that,the student is able to acquire knowledge and skills.

I will conclude by saying,distance learning from home to class and by online or video conferencing is good because, they save money and time, student is able to understand and do research about what they dont know. Any student who does not take part in distance learning should do so now, because it is important and beneficial for every student.     ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"It's the last day of school, you're sitting in your desk leg bouncing anxiously waiting for the final bell to ring. That bell of freedom, but just a minute before it rings your teacher reminds the class of the most dreaded thing on the planet, the student summer project.

Everybody groans in disdain, but the feeling of dread is washed away with the final chime of the squeaky high pitched freedom cry. You're now a month into your three month summer break and your project pops into your mind, but is brushed off quickly with the though of ""I'll do it later"". More time goes by, one month, then the next. Now its four days before the first day of school and you're laying in bed thinking ""oh this is bad"". This happens to students almost everywhere you look on earth, Massive procrastination that doesn't end until its too late. How do we curb this? I believe the best option is the Teacher Designed Summer Project, TDSP for short, and here's why.

My First reason for thinking the TDSP is better than the SDSP(student designed summer project) is that students can be just flat out lazy. Using myself as an example, I am a very lazy student. I dont turn things in on time, whenever I do turn things in on time normally they're haphazardly put together and not very cohesive. I know that if our school were to have a SDSP many students, myself included, would not get them done because we believe we have many better things that we could be doing with our time, or we just do not want to do it. If these projects were headed up by a teacher, it would help direct the many students like me.

My next reason on why the TSDP is better is that many students dont know what they want to do with their life once they leave high school. With the help of a specialized TDSP teacher and or counselor, the students can be lead to something that they genuinely enjoy, instead of something that makes them want to pull their hair out every day. A specialized TSDP teacher would know their students and their aspirations in life and can help them form ideas and keep them on the right track through the three months.

My final point on why the TDSP is better, which tacks onto my last point, is that it could encourage kids to pursue something that they love and take charge of their future. With the help of a TDSP teacher, students like me could start to find a calling in life, something that we genuinely enjoy and want to keep doing. That's not something that would happen with students like me if we had no direction.

There are some drawbacks to the TDSP however. The first reason would be it might put more stress on the students in a time where we are supposed to be relaxing from school work to take time for ourselves. The second drawback is that it would put more strain on the school system to pay certain TDSP teachers through the summer, and it would also take precious summer time away from those said TDSP teachers. The third drawback would be that it is catered towards people who are somewhat lazy, restricting the students that are not to a bound path.

It's hard for me to admit that, being one of the students that believes that summer projects are horrible, I still believe that the teacher lead summer project is the best route to go.

"What if high school students did not have to go to school? Rather, what if they could take classes from home? Some high schools offer online classes by website or video conferencing. Many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it teaches them to be accountable, they don't have to come to school if they are sick, and some don't have to face bullies at school.

Most students who attend high school are constantly relying on their teachers to remind them when they need to do work. If students forget to turn in their work, they sometimes blame the teacher for not reminding them when the work is due. However, if students attended online classes at home, they would be responsible for what gets done. They can do their work anywhere by means of technology such as: laptops, tablets, and cell phones. This prepares high school students for college, and their future adult lives by teaching them to be responsible for their own time and work.

Quite often, many high school students become terribly sick. Many sickly students despise attending school. They're tired, contagious, and probably unable to focus. If they miss school due to illness, students miss hours of education that heavily impacts their grades. If students could attend class online, they would not miss anything taught at school that day. Students could work from home without passing on their sickness to other students or missing any important knowledge necessary for them to be successful.

Unfortunately, many students experience bullying from other students at high school. It heavily impacts the bullied children and they're mental health. Many of them no longer have the desire to attend school afterwards. To solve this dilemma, those students could have the opportunity to attend online classes from home. At home, they don't have to face monstrous bullies, and they can focus on their schoolwork. This would greatly benefit the defenseless students by helping them to be successful through education without attending high school.

Many high school students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it teaches them to be accountable, they don't have to come to school if they are sick, and some don't have to face bullies at school. Therefore, more schools should offer online courses and video conferencing for students because it is less beneficial not to do so.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

Cell phones are an important thing in students lives, and are an important part in their lives.

In school some students need to get a hold of their parents for something important.

Students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch and passing time, but be off before class starts.

In school many times I have needed to get a hold of my mom or dad to tell them that basketball practice has been canceled or I don't need them to sign me up for something I can sign it up at school. If I was able to use my phone during passing time or at lunch it would be a lot easier for my parents and I to communicate and it would cause less confusion for my family.

I know of many students that need to get a hold of their family or someone but they cannot because we cannot use cell phones and the office will not allow a student to use the office phone.

My cousin goes to Novi high school and they are allow to use their cell phones at points during the school day and it has never caused any problems.

Students should be allowed to use their cell phones during passing time and in lunch.

If student were allowed to do this it would make all family's lives a lot easier.

If the parent knows that the student needs to be picked up from school it will allow the student to get home from school earlier making it easier to do their homework right, and with high quality.

Sincerely,

"Is technology a valuable source for everything? In the world we live in now, the year of 2016, we've discovered things that are taking place that would've never even been though of before. And now, the idea of driverless cars has came upon. I don't agree that this is the best idea for us right now. Simply because, it takes away from alot of learning, it'll cause lots of disagreements with individuals and manufacturers, and technology is'nt always dependable.

Driverless cars will take away from learning. In the United States now there are many laws for finally being elgible to drive. Going through the permit policy at the correct age, and then finally your license. Many teenagers have already went through this process, with taking drivers ed, practicing behind the wheel and more. But, with driverless cars it'll lead the growing generation right into what they don't know and you should still know how to drive while in the car, but with no knowledge of that concept, how will that work?

As stated in the passage, ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" If there is any type of wrong happening, both sides will make any claim to make sure their not at fault. Factors like money problems and a bad name could occur against the manufacturer, and money situations against the individuals also. No one will want to be blamed, and it could cause so much. There are always lawsuits and situations where it's a company against a citizen.

As we can all verify now, technology isn't always dependable. Starting from phone problems, updating apps, getting into Google, loosing files, crashing, and more. It's never 100 percent dependable. Let's say the sensors seek a problem too late, or not at all, it's the inviduals job to just be secure and take control, then what is the purpose of even having them hold the name of driverless? There so many wrongs that can happen. If a driver is sleepy, and thats her reason for wanting the driverless taxi, and ends up falling asleep, not able to respond to sensors, what happens? And whose fault is it?

All in all, I believe there's not a big purpose or need for this concept right now. There's not, and theres so many reasons why. Taking away from learning, causing lawful conflicts, and the use of not so dependable technology.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"How would you feel if there is a machine that can tell you how youe feeling or what your emotions are?

Well there is a software that is the lastest innovation from professer. I think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in classrooms is valuable because its important for students to know how students are doing and feeling. Some students probably dont want to talk about how their feeling because there probably scared or something . Some kids in school go through depression which is bad because if kids go through depression, some kids will commit sucide and we dont want that to happen. For that computers to read humans minds, it has to have all fourty-four major muscles like in a human , then it also has to move like what humans muscle do. In this new software or invention, it can track your facial expressions and movement. Which that is amzaing because I really want to help our other students or kids out so they wont go through sad,depressed,mad,etc.

My conclusion to this is that its very helpful to have a machine to read or can tell how kids are doing now. We dont want student nor kids going to think about committing suicdue. We lost so much syduents or kids because they are going bullying. If they being bullyed you can at least talk to them or try to have the new invention read their emotions.

"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" a writer states that scientists are trying to study the planet Venus. In his article, he claims that while it is very risky, it may be worth it in the end. he also gives details about how dangerous it really is, and what the planet might have been at one point in time.

In the second paragraph, The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size."" but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" Plus, on its surface, ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.

Not only is high temperatures and extreme pressures an issue, he also states that there are volcanoes and major earthquakes that happen, plus lightning is constant as well. But there is no context to whether or not scientists are trying to figure out what causes the the powerful earthquakes to happen, or why lightning strikes frequently happen. He also states that, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" But there is nothing that follows it that claims what happened or could have happened to cause high pressures, high temperatures, and a high level of carbon dioxide to form.

While scientists believe that Venus was at one point like earth, there are some facts that show that it has the looks of earth in some ways. the writer says that Venus, ""has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These features are exactly what earth has as well. But there could be more than what meets the eye. In parapgraph six, the writer says that,"" peering a Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" This issue puts a damper on scientists ability to study the planet. But thats just it, what are scientists trying to study. The article says,""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.'' Which is great they are working on that, but what are they trying to collect, find, or explore.

Overall, the article is good, but there needs to be more detail in what is happening. they need information on what scientists are specifically trying to study, what they are looking for, and more detail on how they are progressing in studying Venus. With more details about what they are trying to find, it would be easier to evaluate whether or not the scientist efforts are really worth it, or just a waste of time. A planet that is inhabitable by humans or anything living is already a risk as is.       ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"School policy

Dear Principle,

I think that your rule about the new school policy should not be tolerated. I think that students should be able to play sports no matter what their grades are. What if the sport their playing is their only exercise. What if that is the only time to be with friends out of school. what if the sports is helping them get good grades. I will tell you why grades don't matter to play sports in this letter.

So what if the sport their playing is their only time and place for exercise. If their getting a C then they can't get that exercise. They will gain a lot of weight and get out of shape until the grades are up. And cupid U.S. is already dealing with an obesity problem; Don't make it so there is another reason for us to gain weight.

What would happen if the only time to see friends was at their sports practice or games. If one person was getting bad grades and the others were getting good grades then no one would be able to see their friends. Soon that person will be detached from his/her friends and not be able to make new ones. Would you want to have some of your students not to have friends all because of you?

What if the sport he/she is playing makes them get good grades. Then when the sport is taken away he/she will continue to get bad grades. When a student plays a sport it will keep them awake and energized. When the student can no longer play that sport they will feel tired and not be able to work as hard. Also, when a student plays a sport it is proven that they will sleep better. When students sleep better they will be more alert in school. Don't you want your students to shine?

That is why i think that grades should not matter to play sports. No one wants their child to become overweight. Everyone wants friends, and everyone wants good grades. Remember how fun it was playing sports when you were a kid. How would it feel to have that taken away if you had one C. Done take away sports!",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear state senator,

I very much think that the voting of the president should be changed to popular vote rather than the electoral college. There is too many things that can go wrong with he electoral college. If popular vote is taking place, it solves many problems. For examble, the electoral college does'nt have to vote for the president they were chose for, and a tie could end up happening because the votes are even at 538.

Many important people of the government have tried to abolish the electoral college at times, including Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. There is many flaws within the electoral college. Like in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but then lost the electoal vote, if this is a government based on what the people want, then popular vote should by far be appointed over the electoral college.

In 1976 a tie could of been very possible, if 5,559 voters in ohio would of voted oppisite, and 3,687 would of voted oppisite, there would of been a complete disaster in the election. In 2000, people in 25 of the biggest media states didnt get to see any campaign adds, also voters in 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all!

Some people feel that if there was a popular voting for the president, there would be many disputes, but if this is a democracy and the government is ran by the people, then the popular vote is by far better than the electoral college.

All in all, popular vote is just the better way to go, it'll be what the people want, and there wont be any questions asked about the outcome of the election.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When people need advice they will most likely ask multiple people so they can get different anwsers. Having different anwsers will help a person out by giving them multiple options to choose from. When someone responds with what they were thinking of they are likely to choose it if someone else agrees. Someone could think your idea is really bad but some people wont; Thats why it is always good to ask for multiple people's opinion.

I have learned this because There have been multiple times where I am hesitant to do something but if I have someone supporting me and what I want do, I will most likely make the best decision for me. An example of this in my life is reclassing next year. My family supports me making my own decision allowing me to do what is best for me. This allows to not worry about what others think. If one of my parents disagreed in my decision I will most likely not do it even if they allowed me to.

"I am against changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average because without sports or activities people are not going to stay healthy. I think it would be better if people could get at least a grade C average. A grade C average is still a good grade and its a passing grade. It only takes a C to continue on to high school or middle school. it is good to get a C or higher grade because it can give you knowledge and it also can get you into a good college.

If people get a C- or below they shouldn't be able to play sports or any other activities because school is more important then sports or activities. Also you have to be responsible to be in sports because you can not miss practice or be late to a game. And with education you have to be responsible as well because you have to do homework and turn in homework without being past the due date. If you are getting a C- or below that means you are lazy or irresponsible therefore you will be lazy or irresponsible in sports or any activities and because of bad grades in school i think they shouldn't let you play sports due to failing classes.

I do not agree with you in changing the school policy. People should at least get a C average in order to play sports. Even though school is more important you have to play sports or do activities in order to get in shape or stay in shape and you have to stay healthy. Sports is one way of staying fit and healthy. It is also good to be active and in order to be active you have to be in sports or do different activities.

"In American society today- and other countries also- it's safe to say that only a little bit more than half of teengers are wanting to get their driver's liscense. It is the same way with adults too. More people are choosing to move to smaller communities where shopping centers and restaraunts are a walking distance away. At first, it was all about just following the trend or a new law. Now people are realizing that not driving everywhere is benificial in more than one way.

In Europe, this trend is growing rapidly and has been for a few years now. Countries like Germany, Frace and Switzerland are examples of where a large percentage of their population don't drive cars. In Vauban, Germany it is against the law to park anywhere except for parking garages and if the car-owner purchases their own parking space, with a home also, for $40,000. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P3). Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from 12% of car-owners in Europe. With less cars, it is said there the city has a less tense and/or stressful vibe to it, and the pollution level has decreased dramatically.

In America, the love for cars is not as strong anymore either. In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995, and 23% of people weren't driving between the years of 2001-2009. ""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communites, and legislators are are starting to act, if cautiously."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P9). Though reducing the amount of cars being driven has a positive impact on the environment, it will have a negative impact on car indistries across the U.S.

Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have prooved that having less car-owners has decreased pollution levels. In Bogota, there is a Day Without Cars where only public transportation is allowed. Citizens will suffer a $25 fine if they are driving their own car. Paris, France temporarilly banned driving, and if they were found driving a 22-euro fine was charged. Both countries saw immediate results in the ammount of smog in theit cities.

It is obvious that not owning a car or choosing to walk more than driving has effected places like Europe, America and South America in a positive way. As more people realize that limiting car usage is good for the environment and benificial to their everyday lives, less people will be driving and the world will slowly see start to see a change.

"Our world is changing. People try to improve things we use most in daily life. Cars is a highly used mode of transportation and Sergey Brin is on a quest to improve daily use of cars. Many positives and negatives can be found in the use of driverless cars. I find that if something is not good, make it better. If people find many flaws in driverless cars, then I see a need to improve it. I think the idea of a driverless car should be futher developed until the positives clearly outweigh the negatives.

I think that driverless cars could be very valuble in the future. The driverless car comes with many benefits. One of the major upsides of a driverless car is hypothetically safer than a car with a human driver. Human drivers are subject to drunk driving, sleeping while driving, and overall human errors. In a world of all cars being driverless cars, commute from destination to destination would be more efficient. The estimated time from place to place would be more exact as cars would be traveling the quickest route consistently. People would also be traveling legally at the right speed. As it says in paragraph one, gas expenses would also go down. When the car knows where it is going, there is no route to get lost on, therefore less distance traveled, less money spent on gas. People can also pay a lot of money towards fines and other crash related expenses. Ideally, driverless cars would eliminate the penalty of speeding and would hopefully eliminate the expenses of a crash. However, the idea of a driverless car is still in the making.

Driverless cars can also come with various disadvantages. One of the most obvious downsides of a driverless car is price. The price of a driverless car would be insane. In paragraph four and five, the passage mentions the various sensors needed in order to mimic the ability of a human driver. It also says, ""Sensors are nothing new, of course."" However, cars with these sensors in them are known to cost more than most cars. Not to mention the act of adding many more sensors which would continue to the raise the price of this vehicle. Another downside this passage brings up is the idea of liability. In a perfect world, we would like to imgaine a perfect car that would never get in accidents or collisions. However, we know that accidents are possible due to pedestrians, bikers, natural reasons and more. So liability comes into play when an accident is on hand. Depending on the situation, who is to blame? There is yet to be laws made in order to determing this question, but the idea of driverless cars remain the same.

Driverless cars need to be improved, investigated, and developed more before they are determined to be logical modes of transportation for our world today. I think the idea of a driverless car makes sense, but much more research needs to resolve these negative downsides. In order for the driverless car to product the people want, the price would have to be reasonable and the saftey of the passengers would need to be ensured. I think driverless cars should be further developed before they are put into the world of today.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Driverless cars sound like everybody's fantacy, you see and hear about them from everywhere; fictional movies, childrens books, television, but having a driverless car might not be the fantacy you hoped for. There are many problems that come with the driverless cars. While you may be able to get around easily, who would be at fault if technology fails and someone is injured- The driver, or the manufacturer? Surely If you were to be in an accident because the car itself malfunctions causing injuries to you and other people you wouldn't be to blame?

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert human drivers. In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. Why? Because it is rather dangerous. Another negative aspect would be that not everybody would agree with driverless cars, so would this cause a problem? Having normal cars and driverless cars on the streets together?

Having a driverless car will cause issues with navigating through roadwork or accidents, because they might be programmed for certian roads with certain conditions. So if something were to happen such as an accident would the car know when to stop? Or if there was an ambulance coming down the road for an emergencey, would the car know to pull over and let it pass?

Another con to the driverless cars would be that there would be so many sensors to go along with it. These types of cars need to have sensors in every direction, because there are unexpected animals, or children that cross the road without paying attention, they need to make sure the sensors are able to detect those types of things fast.

Technology is going very far but not this far yet, we might be trying to rush it too much, having only driverless cars would pretty much mean getting rid of normal cars, therefore; Many car buisnesses go out of work and many people lose their jobs. That being said, it would be way to expensive to replace normal cars with driverless cars for the billions of people in the world. While there are many benefits to this idea of driverless cars there are just as many if not more cons.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Limiting car usage can only be positive

We don't need them if we all work together

Car pool denser cities alts will be available (public transit)

Cost effective and convenient

Sidewalks > roads

Convenient(s1l6)

Better for us(can still interact without over-driving)[interactive biking/walking | online interaction]

Giving our cars up in this day and age seems impossible; but if everyone can work together, new opportunities will arise that'll outweigh the convenience of having a personal vehicle. We won't need cars if we all work and cooperate with one another. Not only that but it'll become more cost effective and convenient as a whole in the long run. Once all is said and done, limiting car usage can only be positive.

Many questions would arise if this idea was approached, wouldn't we take longer to get places? Isn't it inconvenient and a step-back from personal commuting? The answer would be yes, but for the most part it's the point. Sure you make take longer to get places by car pooling or taking public transit, but if anyone is doing it there'll be no comparison of time with personal commuting, personal commuting will be gone. If no cars were available cities would compensate with free bikes when commuting or public transit. The no-car weekend in Paris allowed free public transit, so in the long-term it'd also be free (Source 2). City planning would be modified to compensate for the increased commuting time; making the long commutes a little easier. If we all work together we won't need cars, and in the end it'd be positive overall.

In a world of reduced personal commuting, the cost of living would improve as well. Money spent on gas or car maintenance would be nonexistent. Instead of using taxes on expensive roads, they'll be used on inexpensive sidewalks, just like in Bogota (Source 3). With the extra cash from no car expenses it'll be easier to purchase luxury items you may want. Cities will be made with convenience in mind, placing key stores in easily accessible areas, similarly to Vauban's store placement (Source 1). This would answer the question of inconvenience, A ten minute drive can become a ten minute bike or walk with strategic placement. In the end, a reduced car usage society would be more cost effective and convenient, a definite positive compared to an automobile society.

Cars are definitely important to many people, but only because the majority have cars. Take everyone's cars away and they wouldn't have a reason to need one. If we all work together we won't need cars, people will help one another and cities would be planned better. In this society you'd have more money to use as you please, instead of using it to survive. Most important of all, the time to take a car someplace rather than any other alternative would be the same; important locations can always relocate for everyone's convenience. A world without cars can only be positive.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

dying in a hospital bed is my grandpa with a blood clot stuck in his heart and i don't find out until the end of the day because my parents had no way of getting in touch with me, considering i was at school and my phone wasn't aloud to be turned on. So there I am, walking into the hospital seeing my grandfather laying on a bed with all the life sucked out of him. I didn't even get to have my last words with him before he passed away. Therefore i believe that cell phones should be aloud to be turned on during lunch and in between classes because, its a good way of communication in case of emergencies and its also a way of just talking to your friends.

Now imagine, a school of lots of happy kids communicating with all their friends and putting them in the most perfect mood possible all because cell phones are aloud to be used during some part of school hours.

I don't think that having phones out during lunch and in between classes is a big deal at all. I mean, what is the difference. As long as the phones are turned off during class how can it possibly bother anybody? In case of emergencies or with family issues, it can always be useful to be able to check your cell phone for voice mails, missed calls, or text messages.

Also , I think kids should be aloud to communicate with their friends during a part of school incase they want to plan something later, or help each other with a school project or even just to text each other for fun. Now a days technology is so outstanding kids can send and receive messages to each other within 15 seconds! Why not take advantage and use the technology we have now?

"I think these projects should be students designs instead of teacher designed. The students designs can influence each other, help one another, and the teachers don't have to come up with the projects for the students.

To begin with, having students to design the summer projects can have a good affect on the students. The students can influence other students to come up with ideas for the summer project. For example, they can help the organize something for their community as a summer project. Doing a summer project can get the students to do more for everybody that's around them. Also they can be able to work together as a team.

Next, they can help one another out. The students can come together to work to help each other out. Helping the other students is good for the teacher to see on how well the sstudents can work doing a summer project. The students can help come up with different ideas if they get stuck on something and need help. Helping ech other out is that they can communicate wirhh one another so that they can be able to work togther and comfortable around other students.

Fianlly, the teachers don't have to come up with project for the students to do. It would be less wor for them because they would have explain what they need to for the project. It will be easier for the teachers to be organized with keeping the projects from being all over the place. For example, they also can be graded fatest.

"Imagine this, you're on your way to eat out after a big game. You're having a good time listening to music with your teammates. Then out of nowhere everything goes silent. You've been hit and the reason is because of someone texting and driving. Texting and driving should not be allowed at all. It puts people's lives at risk including the drivers and any passengers.

In recent years' studies have shown that each year, about 1,300,000 people are killed in accidents. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. If you do decide to use your phone while driving you are 23 times more likely to have a car crash.

It has gotten so bad that texting and driving has replaced drinking and driving as lead cause of death among teen drivers. The reason is because teenagers are barely starting to drive, when they decide to use their phone while behind the wheel it distracts them from the road.

However, this is not only with teens, people no matter what age cannot and should not be multitasking while driving. They need to be aware of all their surroundings.

There have been many incidents that have to do with this. For example, a teen from

Minnesota drove past a red light and killed the other driver plus his 10-year-old daughter. Also, a driver of a pickup truck collided with a church bus in Texas. This ended up with 13 people dead.

You have to make sure that people around you aren't texting and driving as well. There has been many times that people have lost their lives due to someone else's mistake. A teenager in

Anchorage, Alaska ran through a stop light, killing 27-year-old woman and mother of 2 children.

Using your phone while driving is considered illegal in 46 states not including Arizona,

Montana, Texas and Missouri. If busted, fines range from 20 to 500 dollars. It all depends on the state. Some states consider it a criminal misdemeanor which can result in jail or prison time. To avoid any accidents or any tickets there are different things you can do. You can ignore your phone for the car ride or leave it in the back seat so you're not tempted. You can always ride with someone and ask them to check your phone for you. If you need your phone for GPS and you're by yourself, you can always invest in a phone holder that connects to your window. This way you can see where you need to go but you're not distracting yourself by touching it and putting all your focus on that.

Texting and driving should be banned in all states. It is not safe for the passengers in or around the car. So many accidents will happen if people decide to do it. There is so many different things that a person can do to avoid any crashes or fines. Texting and driving should take place in two different times. It can put you at risk to lose everything, even your own life.

Next time you're in the car and you get a text think twice before picking up your phone. Just think about it.

Don't do it.      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In my opinion, the students tanking to attend classes from home, by way of oline or video conferencing. I think the students not have benefit from being able to attent classes from home.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Conclucion; the students not taking the classes from the house or distance learning, but students learning more when she go to the schools. The parents thinks exactly whit me, because is most effective taking the classes in the schools, in not a distance the schols. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Being a seagoing cowboy is oppertonity of a lofe time. Read my three reasons why you should be a seagoing cowbaoy.

You can help people in need. Like giving them food taking them to medical attetion if needed. Plus helping people is the greatest feeling in the world. Like even the little stuff like helpin an elder walk across the street picking someones books up. Just help people in need every day.

You get to see and meet new people every day. Becomig friends with someone is the most wonderful thing. Helping some one in need then becoming there friend is great. You can learn new cultures in making friends. Just be nice to friend and people you don't know.

You get to see expirence new things. You can see things you proably never heard of. You can see the been in chicago. You could see one of the temples in greece. Just go out there and do somthing diffiernt.

Being a seagoing cowboy is just a different thing to do. If you like helping people this for you. If like going out and making new friends then be a seagoing cowboy. If you like seeing new things and adventure you would be pefect. So it is now your dission to be a sea going cowboy if you like to do all these things this is for you.

"The face on the moon is just a rock that gives an illusion to the human eye. The face had become popular and eveyone was talking about it. It appeared on Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even the haunted grocery store for 25 years.

The face is on the planet Mars and other people thought it was a face of an alien of some kind. They thought that because it looked like it had a nose,pair of eyes, and a mouth. The first picture of the face on mars was in 1976 which is called the Viking photo. The second was taken by Mars Global surveyor (MGS) form 1998. Finally, the third image was the latest image from MGS in 2001.

A few scientists believed it was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars MGS arrived at the Red Planet inseptember 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. April 5,1998 MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds Jim Garvin most of Middle Butte in the Snake River. The Face on Mars became very popular and showed on many events like the television, newspaper articles, books, and the checkout area in grocery stores for 25 years. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"People ask for advice on a daily basis, But is asking more then one person to much advice. You need more then one persons advice for different things and everybody has an opinion on different things so you should as multiple people for any advice you need. There can be people who agree with you and who dont agree with you so its always good to know both sides of the story.

Lets say you want a new pet so you ask 5 of your friends what you should get between a puppy and a grown dog, You might want a puppy but not all your friends might agree with you,3 out of 5 friends say you should get a puppy because it is energetic and you can see it grow and it will be loyal to you because it has been your puppy for along time,2 out of 5 friends say you should get a grown up dog because it will be trained and it will not pee in your house as much as puppies do,both sides of your friends gave very good advice so now you can think about what you really want.

Getting advice from more then one person like you mom and from your dad you can ask them how a dress looks on you,your mom will know what to look at like how your body looks in it how it fits you all these things but you dad on the other hand wont say as much as your mom he might just say it looks nice without really looking at every little detail on your dress.

"Summer projects allow students to have the opportunity to learn while they are not in school and it can benefit them in many ways. Summer projects should be designed by students because it gives students the opportunity to learn more about something of their choice, it shows that they have a connection with the project, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things.

Students should be given the opportunity to create a project about something of their choice. It gives them independence and the ability to rely on themselves. It is good to give students independence starting at a young age because it allows them to be self reliant. Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic. Teachers love when a student creates a well designed and well thought out project. If a student were to be given a project designed by the teacher, the student would feel like they couldn't do much with it because they have no connection with it. When students have a connection with something it makes them feel more enthusiastic about the project or assignment given to them.

Students are more eager to learn about new things after they researched something of their choice. When students have a choice, they would rather research something that they don't know too much about. After that topic is researched they feel enlightened. Students also tend to branch off of the topic that they first researched as well. This technique is often used by students because it makes research easier for them and they like to make things easier for them rather than harder.

In conclusion, Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it gives them new opportunities, it shows that they can connect to something, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things. Although teachers can provide students with a base and a template for their project, it would be best and beneficial for students to be able to create and think of something on their own. Students are more prepared for college and high up positions in life when they are given the opportunity to create something of their own. It allows students to have independence and other useful tools for their future.              ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some people say distance learning is a waste of time and is not effective, when really, online schooling is becoming more popular as technology advances. Being able to succeed in an education from home is something that is often necessary. Being able to complete school work from home is helpful to not only students, but the school systems too. This way of learning makes sure students that are not able to physically attend school still get their share of education. Distance learning can be beneficial to students recovering from a major operation, or a severe social problem.

Serious injuries happen involving students attending school more than you think. Some of these injuries require a major operation, causing the student to miss weeks of school and instruction time. Yes, parents can pick up the work that their child missed and bring it home, but doing this results in the child not knowing how to do the work. If they were not there when the lesson was taught, they would never be able to figure out the concept. If the student was told they would be out for 8 weeks due to surgery, they could quickly transfer to a distanced learning program. This way, they could video chat and speak to a teacher live. This would allow the student to get thorough instructions explained to them clearly, and help with any material they simply do not understand. Without this type of program, students would fall into a deep hole of confusion.

Although everyone can get a little nervous in front of a large group of people, some people just cannot possibly function in large groups. Some students were born with bad cases of social anxiety, or other illnesses causing them to be socially awkward. For students like this, a home schooling online class would be the best way to educate them. Yes, they would still have to speak face to face with a teacher through video chat, that is only one person compared to a school of a thousand people. This would end the fears of students dreading to go to school each day. They could get their work done in peace, and not have thoughts of everyone watching them in their head. This would lead to them not getting easily distracted from education. Although, letting a student choose to avoid public school because of a social problem is not preparing them for the future; If the student does not focus in school due to the surrounding people, The good education they would get online is more important.

With reasoning as to why distance learning is beneficial, it should be looked at by more people and become a popular alternative. Everyone should have the right to know about this option and its details because online schooling might be a good choice for them. This alternative could benefit many more people than it already does. School systems would be looked at better with a higher passing rate and higher scores. Although distance learning is more of a process to get into, it would be beneficial to the ones suffering from major operations or social problems like many students enrolled in school today.                   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"If you were able to attend school from home that would't be the best choice, and the reasons why is cause you would be getting lazy and you would e getting used to that laziness, for me i rather go to school to actually learn and not at home cause i know for sure im going to slack off most of the time,

Being home schooled would sound nice but depending on the things that your learning, You can start class any time when your being home schooled, i mean hey i dont want to wake up early to go to a public school i mean no kid wants to wake up early just for that, being home schooled is nice cause you can do whatever you want while doing work, waking up late wouldnt be bad it would sound nice, students being home schooled have some lack of education cause they got used to becoming lazy and not doing anything theres no teacher to tell him/her what to do they can do whatever they want with no teacher to bother them.

but over all attending to being home school wouldnt sound to bad but being home schooled is expansive isnt it ? compaered to a public school..........

"Limiting car usage could make americans daily life alot better. Americans have always relied on a automobile for there means of transpertatio n but if we limited our automobile use our lfe's would get alot better. Other countries are doing it and there getting positive outcomes. So should we follow other countires in there no car days or car ban?

In Vauban, Germany the community is completely car free. its a experimental district that does not allow the ownership of a car, 70 percent of familes in Vaubans do not own cars 57 percent sold a care to move to Vauban. Heidrum Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""by elimanting the use of cars this community is less stressful of traffic and has reduced emmisions.

If us as Americans used bikes or walked or took the buses to our destination, pollution and smog would decrease. In Paris a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. After 2 days of the car ban the sog cleared up. Imagine if we did that here in the united states polution would go down drasticaly.

And if we stoped driving cars for a few days every week there would be lesser car accidents every year. people would have to walk to there destination or ride a bike and people would get exercise from the walking or riding the bike. We would spend less money on gasoline or desiel.

Americans car use is already have starting to decrease since 2005, If the pattern persists it will have benefial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. So many good thigs come from using cars less and if we start following the trend our lifes and communities will soon improve.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools require summer projects for students; these projects need to be student designed. When teachers plan a project some students don't enjoy completing the assigned task. For students to learn they have to be interested in what they are doing. There are many ways to assign a school project, it could be hands on, writing, individually, in groups etc. Each student has different skills, they should do a project that best fits that skill to succeed. Summer projects need to be student designed so that they are more motivated to complete the assignment, to have fun with the assignment and to have interest in the task.

Summer projects need to be student designed to enhance motivation. When students are motivated this encodes the topic in their memory. When students are motivated they get better grades, the project is better quality and students do the project to their best ability. As a student when a project gets assigned and I am not interested in the assignment I try to get it done as quickly as possible and put no effort into it. I end up getting a lower grade. Students will also want to keep working on the project if they are motivated to complete it. With more time spent on the project this equals better quality and higher grades. Students won't procrastinate if the project interests them and will be motivated to start the project early. As a student in High School lots of students procrastinate when given a project. If projects were student designed this would motivate them to learn about the topic.

Summer projects need to be student designed so that they have fun with it. If they had fun with the assignment then they would have a memory of their experience. If schools made learning fun they are more likely to remember the topic of the project. If students were in a group for the project this would enhance team work skills if they had fun. As a student I found out that if I had fun learning about a certain topic I remember it more clearly and can connect it to other things in life.

Summer projects need to be student designed to have students have interest in the topic. This would help students explore their interests that they never knew they were interested in. This may help students what they want to do after graduation. Chances are if a student is really interested in what they learned in class then they might explore that topic outside of school. When I had a project assigned to me that I was interested in I enjoyed completing the project and continued to learn more about it outside of school. Summer projects that have students interested is a key to success in their academic career.

In conclusion, summer projects need to be student designed so that they look forward to working on the assignment, enjoy completing the task and continue learning about the topic outside of school. Some people say that projects should be teacher designed they are wrong because students then dont get the freedom of doing what they enjoy most. It also isn't equal to all students. For example, a teacher assigns a research paper on a certain topic, some students have a love for writing and it is their strength and others don't like to write. This is why student designed projects are important. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principal,

I disagree that students should have a B average to play in sport. Students should be able to have a c average and still is able to play in sports because some sports are reasons students stay in school, everybody isn't ""excellent"" at school and can't maintain any grade higher that a C, and because without sports students may not even try to maintain their C average they might just flunk. This is why i think that students should be able to have a C average and still be eligible to play sports.

Students should be able to play sports with a C average because sometimes sports are the reason children stay in school anyway. Some children wants to become professional in basketball, baseball, soccer, etc.. but they know they cant do it without proper education so that why they stay in school. If they change the system to were you have to have an B average to play sports and the C average athlete will just feel that there is no purpose for school and just drop out. They will drop out dude to the fact that they feel as if their dreams has been crushed and that they have no future hope because they cant get that B average that is mandatory.

Also, students should be able to play sports with an C average because not everybody can maintain a B average. Just because people go to school that doesn't mean that they were that ""star student""! It doesn't mean that they got an A or B on every test, sometimes they aren't the best and even were they are at their best. When you get an

C that means your average your not the best and your not the worse, so why not be able to play sports? You have to at least knowledge the fact that they are trying and persevering trying to make it to the top.

Students sometimes live around sports. Sports are some students life. Why take that away from them because they are one grade down from being ""perfect""? Some students might just be like ""who cares about school now that i cant play my sports"". Public school systems cannot have students flunking their grades and just not caring all because they can't play sports. If sports are getting our students on the right track even thought they have a C average then don't take away their sports because they have a C average. If anything teacher, principals, parents, and etc.. should be helping that student strive for that B average or that A

average not taking away what they love. It wont do anything but make them angry and just give up .

As one can see, I disagree with the idea that students shouldn't be able to play sport even though they have an C average. I say this because sports are reasons students stay in school, everybody isn't ""excellent"" at school and can't maintain any grade higher that a C, and because without sports students may not even try to maintain their C average they might just flunk. In all, this is the reason why i disagree with having to have a C average to participate in outside activities.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear principal,

I agree that students should have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Students will try to do better in school to be able to play a sport, Students will only play a sport if they really want to, and school's grade average will raise.

Many students love to play school sports and will try harder in school if it means that they can play. Many students do not put forth all their effort in school because they don't care. If a student needs to have a B average to be able to play sports many students will start completing all of their homework, start studying for tests, and just put more effort into school just so they can play the sport that they want to. Many students play sports and would do anything to continue to play the sport they love. Studies show that 2 out of 3 students play a sport and 1 out of 15 of those students has a B average or higher.

Students that aren't invested in their sport and don't care much about the sports they play will not try to raise their average but students who do will. That means that only students who are dedicated to sports and will put forth all of their effort for that sport will raise their average. That will give the sports teams more victories and make the school more proud of our teams. ""I would do anything to be able to play soccer."" comments one of the 8th grade students. This students' love for soccer will compel him to raise his grade to a B average or even higher.

Lastly, if all the students raise their average for school the school's academic ranking will also raise. That could be good for the school because parents will see that their children are getting a great education and they will be more likely to do more for the school like, volunteer, donate money, and supplies. Many schools are having money problems and donations could prove helpful for the district.

Students needing a B average to be able to participate in sports and other activities could prove helpful in many ways such as, students trying harder in school, more invested sport players , and the school's academic ranking will raise a sufficient amount.

A student",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Driverless cars aren't always so great

My position in driverless cars is that I'm opposing them.

Even though Google cofounder Sergey Brin can, I'm not ready to put my life nor my family's life on the line even after years and years of people testing them and making the driverless cars 100% safe.

Electronics always mess up somewhere down the road, even 100% safe, so why trust a driverless car when it could mess up and put your whole family's life on the line.

In the text it say's that ""Driver's need to stay alerted at all times"" but why if this car is 100% safe, aren't we aloud to sit and talk to are family while we are on the move.

The text also stats that ""If there is a wreck who's going to be the blame, the owner of the driverless car or the manufacturer"" so why buy it if you might be the one to blame and not the manufacturer who made this 100% safe driverless car.

My points go to prove why I'm sticking to a car I can personally drive and not a car that's still not 100% safe on the road yet.

So I ask you, would you like to move on with the rest of the world and put your life and other people's lives at risk every day with a driverless car or a car that you can drive and help keep others safe.

"The Electoral collage is a process , not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as comprimise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The thing is the president shouldnt be picked on his personality or his or hers past, they should be judged by the changes they can make and how they can make it better for the people on the out side world. they shouldnt be voted by the fancy no good stuck ups in the office 24/7 bc half the time they dont know good, i mean look at the president we have now.

The process consists of the section of the electors, which they vote president or vice president. under the Electoral collage system voters vote not for president but for a state of elections. They shouldnt have to vote like that , why have the office men and women vote president? When u could have the citizens of state do it. The office men and women dont know what the citizens want or need. There just there to get money and sit on there butts 24/7 and do nothing but make poor decisions as a reference to our president.

The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Then in that case the election would be thrown to The House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president. There shouldnt be a tie and having to be thrown in to The House of Represntatives. The president shouldnt be selected by valets and posters. they should be picked based apone what there capable of and how they can change the owrld and make it a better and safer place.

"Dear, principal

Your idea of changing the school policy of students must have a C average or better to participate in sports or other activities could upset some of the students. By changing the policy to, you must have at least a B average or better to participate in sports or other activities will make some students previously eligible to now being ineligible. This change could affect some of the students view of you as a principal, and it could also anger some of the parents that has a child with a C average but really enjoys him/herself in an activity or sport.

By changing the policy and making some students ineligible, forcing them to be kicked off the team or group due to insufficient grades might affect the whole teams moral and overall performance due to lack of players or participants, this might affect the outcomes of some games/competitions.

If a team that was previously a good competitor in a league or tournament but now due to lack of players is either ineligible to participate or is no longer a strong competitor could possibly upset both parents, students, and could affect the image of the school by a sports stand point.

I am writing you this letter in protest to the new change. I calmly advise and ask that you do not change the current school policy of, a student must have at least a C average to participate in sports or other activities, to a student must have at least a B average to precipitate in such things. For this could have adverse affects on the students, the school, the parents, and possibly the community.

"Driverless Cars Are Coming!

Think of all the movies you seen about cars driving by themselves, well they're becoming real. I actually like the fact they're making driverless cars, just like at the beginning of the article, imagine a new future full of technology. By 2030 they'd probably have robots cooking home meals, and tubes passing through out the sky and connected to other tubes for transportation. People wouldn't have to use so much money spending on gas trying to fill their cars up.

Today's world we have better technology where these driverless cars are getting better. There are cars with the ability to start up without an key, just push a buttion. We have cars now that knows when a accident is about to occur, or when an padestrian is near. Imagine driving in your car, and you take your eyes off the road for just a second and a child is in the middle of the street. Driverless cars will break itself and prevent injury to you and the child. Even for emergency vehicles or construction work, it will alert you that it's near. Some cars have self parking, meaning you could get out your car and watch it park itself just by hitting a button. Without hitting other cars, reversing on it's on, and even controlling the headlights if it was to park into a place somewhere dark. It's amazing what our future is becoming!

I believe they have a car that could drive itself. Say you're going on a roadtrip, and the vacation spot takes 24 hours to get there. Your car would drive to that destination while you rest. If your driverless car sees a human, animal, or object in front it will stop it self, there's sensors all over the car to detect that. Some driverless cars have cameras, you would be able to see your blindspot if you were driving. If you wanted to back up into a spot put couldn't see, they will turn on the camera video and you could watch how close you get to an object. These cars even make loud noises or make your seat vibrate to alert you of being to close. If you have a text or call come in, instead of taking your eyes off the road to reach for your phone, they have voice command where you can say ""answer imcoming call"" or many other things. There have been over a million car accidents caused by the drivers or even the car itself, but with the driverless car your safety is garenteed. The driverless cars are much safer for the driver, passengers, and even the outsiders. This is why I'm not against the development of these cars.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear, state senetor

I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America because it makes more sence to change to the election of most popular votes because lets say people vote for one president more than the other president but the president that got less votes gets picked because he/she has more electoral votes than the other.it says on paragraph three in source one that""The electoral college process consists of 538 electors.A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"". This states that the president can get more electoral votes than the other and still get to be the president. i disagree with that i think it is not fare for the president who gets more qualified citizen votes. The citizens are the ones who need/want the presidnt why not give the citizens what they want and what they all vote for? You should give what the citizens want because hey are the ones who are voting for the new president or the same president one more time.it says in paragraph 10 source 2 ""under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a state electors.who in turn elect the president"".

"I agree with the principal, kids need these extracurricular classes. Because after a long days of work, kids want to have fun and relax. First of all kids are full of energy, and parents want them to get it all out before they come home.

Secondly kids can have these extracurricular classes to get rid of their jitters, and have fun at the same time. lastly some kids are less hyper so we can have extracurricular like reading, coloring, photo journalism, etc. In conclusion kids will need these things to calm their nerve or to just chill and do whatever they want .

Sometimes kids are given ice cream or sugary drinks and food at school and the kids will get hyper. They need these things to help them work out the sugar in their bodies. Like sports can help by making them run around and making them tired and get rid of the jitters. in conclusion going to do the extracurricular activities or something can get rid of their jitters out of their systems .

Some kids parents want them to get their jitters out before coming home, but the kids just sometimes want to wait to play with their parents. So kids can go run around and play with friends play games and stuff at school in the extracurricular activities. If kids do these than when they go home they can go to sleep and not bother their parents. in conclusion kids are crazy when they get home so if they get it out at school than they get rid out their energy they wont annoy their parents .

Kids that are calm and quiet are not really active and don't want to do sports. So they can join extracurricular that are calm also like coloring . They can also do reading,yearbooks,and photo journalism or something they like. In conclusion some kids want to do sports and some don't in the extracurricular classes they can do whatever they like .

Kids will need to let out their energy or else they will be bouncing off the walls with so much energy. Some kids would like to let that energy out so they go to the extracrrecular classes. Some kids ant to just chill so they go to these classes where they can do both. In condition I agree with the princapal they should put extracurricular classes for those hyper and non hyper kids .",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principal, you should let the students use them during free time and lunch. The students are American citizens too. The teachers are aloud to use theirs and so should the students. We are equal in rights. If the students will only be aloud to use them during free periods then so should the teachers. We wouldn't have to break the rules if there was no rules to break. So if they were aloud then nobody would try to sneak it all the time during classes. If you made it so that cell phone were banned from the school then a lot of people would need to use the school phones so that they could get rides home and things like that. phones are useful to the student body and if they were taken away then it would be very inconvenient. And since we are all equal then you would have to leave yours at home too and all the teachers would not be aloud either. So the better option is definitely to let the students use them during there free classes. We would be really grateful of you if you could be so nice as to let us keep them. plus if they were banned how would you check every student to make sure that they didn't have a phone with them?

"The question is: created by aliens or just a natural landform? To the uninformed citizen, their answer would most likely be that the Face is created by aliens, and that we should all prepare for Earth's destruction. However, a well trained scientist at NASA, (like me), knows that the Face on Mars is obviously a natural landform.

You might be wondering how the Face on Mars got it's features. It might seem as if it was manmade because no amount of corrosion could make it look like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh."" That answer would be half correct because even though this natural landform is not manmade, the Face's features have not been created by corrosion. Shadows simply appeared in the picture, making it seem as if it were a face of an ancient pharoah. The Face is just another Martian mesa that is commonly found around Cydonia.

Although it is important to know how the Face got it's features, it is also important to know why NASA promoted this Martian mesa as ""the Face on Mars.""

NASA decided that promoting the pictures of the Face could make the public more interested in Mars. We were correct in this sense because it definitely attracted people towards Mars and it's peculiar landform. However, we were incorrect in the idea of promoting it as a Martain mesa that had the features of a pharoah. This image confused the public, and people started believing that there were actual aliens on Mars and that these aliens had made the Face. No matter how many times scientists released research that demolished the idea of life on Mars, the public twisted the story so that it was more interesting.

Even though there was an abundance of research showing there were no aliens making the Face, NASA went out and took more pictures. These images showed that it was only a natural landform, and that there are no actual features on the Face. As I said before, the features were merely created by shadows.

Of course, people still argued that NASA was wrong. People kept saying that the ""markings"" were hid by the clouds, and that these images were simply a failure on NASA's part. This failure being that they somehow forgot to take into account that there was clouds. However, as NASA was more than careful taking these pictures, the images were as accurate as possible.

The Face on Mars may just be a hoax, but NASA's research is nothing of the sort. NASA has proven that their detailed research is used to make sure that the public is well informed. The Face may have just been a natural landform, but the public's enthusiasm for these images, (no matter how skeptical), is something that can never be recreated with shadows. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Driverless cars would be cool, but they're not safe enough to have around. The drivers have nothing to do, the driverless feature in the car could get messed up, or even the things that alert the driver that it's their turn to drive. There are so many dangers to having driverless cars, this is just a few.

For example when all the driver has to do is sit there, it will be takenadvantage of. People could fall asleep at the wheel and not be able to take over the driving when they're needed to. A lot more messing around would occur so the driver would not be focusing. Drivers need to stay focused on the road so everyone can safely arrive to their destination.

Never know when the driverless feature could have a glitch or break down. Cars break down all the time, what's any different about the cars systems? Nothing, these cars could have been manufactured incorrectly. The GPS could also stop working or hit a glitch and you could end up 20 miles away from where you want or need to be.

Imagine. You're in your driverless car, somethings coming up that you need to take over for, but you're just talking away and having a big jam session with all your friends. Your car means to alert you but the system is broken, the car keeps moving but it thinks you're driving, you hit a construction worker. Now you have a huge fine to pay plus you have to get your car fixed.

With these new driverless cars their drivers aren't going to be paying enough attention, your car glitches out, or you're to busy having a jam session with your friends. So many things could go wrong. These cars would be teaching the youth they don't need to pay attention, the car will do it for them.

"I strongly believe in students having to obtain a B average.

Students need to realize that school comes before sports because if you do good in school you will go farther in life.

Sports should be a reward not just something you get any ways. Those on the opposing side think that a C average is passing but soon it will be a D average and then some kids will start failing their classes.

Students need to learn how to be responsible.

It is a privilege to be able to play sports and if someone took sports away from me it would push me to do better in school so i could play sports.

A lot of students who are good enough to play college sports won't be able to because of their grades.

Keeping your grades up to a B average could help you in the future when you are old enough to get a job.

A company might be comparing you to someone who has a B average and you have a C average they will most likely pick the B average.

If you keep your grades up to a B average you would have a better chance of getting into college than if you had a C average.

College could help you get a good job in your future and it would give you a good life.

In conclusion having to obtain a B average would push people who want to play sports to get good grades.

Which would lead you to a better life than obtaining a C average.

"Dear Principle,

I think that it is a bad idea to change the requirement to play sports to a B average because many kids that play sports have a average grade of C. Many kids in our school have a average grade C and I think that it is wrong to be able to take the privilege of playing sports away from them because a C average grade is passing in school. Many kids who play sports do not have enough time after school and practice to study for all there classes and finish there homework in one night and they try there hardest to keep up with kids who don't do sports but might only average a C in that class at that time. To pass a grade in most schools the average grade is a C, so to change our average grade requirement to a B would be unfair to students who only meet a average C grade in class's. Kids who play sports might miss class to go out of town for a game and might miss a test in class and have to make it up. But with the test there grade drops to and there average is below a B then they would not be able to participate in school sports so they would not be able to play in games to come and there would be no motivation to make up the test that they had missed to play the sport. Another reason that it would be a bad idea to change the average grade requirement to a B is because some kids try there hardest in school but only meat a C average but they also love to play a sport and you are not allowing them to play that sport because they are trying there hardest, so there would be no motivation to try there hardest in school anymore and there average grade would drop to less then a C average and would not be learning anything in there class's because they would no longer need to try to keep there grades up to play sports at school and that would ruin there chances of ever getting a good education because they would never try hard enough in school to maintain there grades because there would be no reward for trying there hardest. My last reason to not change the average grade requirement to a B is because kids who might be good at sports and not meat a B average might pay people to do there work for them or cheat on there tests in class, therefore they would not learn anything and when they go to a different school they continue there bad hobbits and not get anywhere in there life because they can not pass class's later on in life or get a good job in life. There is one more thing that I need to say about changing the average grade requirement to a B is because many kids can go on to be professional athletes but if they only get a average of a C and cannot get to there full potential they would never be able to fulfill there dream and never know what they could have been able to do. This is why I think it is not a good idea to change the average grade requirment to a B to play sports it should be left alone for the good of the student body.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Do you enjoy school? Students, ages 5 through 18, have to go to school. Though not all kids may enjoy it. So, how can schools make it more enjoyable for students? Having students participate in extracurricular activities would make school more enjoyable because they can hang out with friends, do something they enjoy, and can prepare for college.

Being social is important. Some kids may not have the time to hang out with their friends outside of school. Participating in extracurricular activities would give students time to hang out with their friends. Some extracurricular activities, such as sports, are enjoyable ways to spend time with friends. Other extracurricular activities, like clubs and working on projects for the school, are also fun ways to spend time with your friends and be social.

Doing something you like is also important. You wouldn't want to only spend your time doing something that you do not like and find boring. Extracurricular activities would give you a chance to do something you enjoy. There are many different types of extracurricular activities you can choose from. Sports and clubs are some of these fun extracurricular activities given by your school. By choosing one of these extracurricular activities you will definitely find something that you will enjoy.

It's important to learn and prepare for the life ahead of you. It's also important to prepare for college. Though not all students may want to prepare for their future, most students probably want to. Through extracurricular activities, students who want to prepare for their future can. Some of the extracurricular activities could be classes that help students learn about an occupation they might want to pursue. While other classes could be a way to learn about making a difference in the world.

School principals should have students participate in extracurricular activities to make school more enjoyable. There are many ways to enjoy school through extracurricular activities, such as hanging out with friends, doing something you enjoy, and preparing for college.

"The Electoral college has been around for a long time but, do we really need it? Is it your votes that affecting your next president. Under the electoral college it is not. The electoral college says that voters do no vote for the president but for a slate of the electors, which elect the presidents. We need to kept the voting process we have now so that way we don't arguments throughout the states. In the electoral college yoor vote is sent to someone not holding public office.

When you vote you are getting a slate of the vote and to feel that their vote does not matter, that the new president will have no regard for their interest,is he really your president. The way we vote today is not that best we can do in some ways. I think that we need to have all the voters votes count towards the president that they want. We should let the people vote for who they want and not for someone else to vote for you. The constituiton says ""We the people, By the people,For the people."" So we should vote for who we want to represent us. The electoral college is based of a winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates.

Another factor that is wrong with the electoral college is that bigger states like Californa get more votes than Columbia. So for example, say that Californa gets 45 electoral votes and then Columbia has the same amount of voters vote for the president they want they will only gte about 5 to 8 because of the state size. Once again restating that we need to vote for we want to and have everyone's vote coung not just the votes added up and then shrunk to electoral votes. The electoral college does have some help in some ways like in a run-off election. The electoral college help control that and produces a clear winner.

The elecoral college does some advantages too, but it still has disadvantges. The electoral college is  the president wins by popular vote. The electoral college has a total of 538 electors but, sometimes the electors don't always listen to their voters and vote for who they want not who the state wants. The president has their own group of electors which have been chosen by the canidate's political party, but certain state lwas vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The election is every four years on the first Tuesday of November, which gives you time to think who you want to be the next president and cast a vote, but with the electoral college your vote could not really count. Have knowing that your vote may not count will make you upset and rethink about voting.

In conclusion, the eletoral college has some good things that does help us but, it has bad things too that make is sadband angry. We decide who we want to run our country but, e need to think about how the voting process really works. I am only one person but, one person can make a difference.

"Dear Principal:

I think that the policy should be that students should have to at least have a grade of B average. There are a few reasons that this should happen. One reason that people should have to have a grade B average is that students studies should definitely come first. Another reason is that it would encourage students to try to get there grades up higher and to not slack off in school. The last and final reason that students should at least have a B average in the school is that every person on the sports team would be smarter, which would possibly mean that the sports teams would become more about strategy than about brute strength, making the teams more deserving of what they earn and more enriching for themselves.

A persons studies should come before any sport. When a person gets good grades, that guarantees that they will at least get one spot in college some where which helps them get an advance in life. If a person were to rely on sports for their life, they are not guaranteed anything in the sports industry. Another thing is that if you are going to rely on sports, to get drafted into any sort of sports team, you need to be one of the best of the best on a college team. You cannot be the best of the best on a college team if you do not even go to college. Even if you get into a college, you have to have a 2.5 grade average to be drafted into any sport. Which is requiring slightly good grades.

Making it so that you can not get into any sports teams with out a B average is just more incentive fort the students to get higher grades and not slack off in any of their classes. Most people that play sports are very intelligent, they just choose in school, to only get the minimal requirement to play sports in their school because they do not want to do much work. Making it so that B is the minimal requirement will make it so all sports players that are only going for the minimal will be forced to get to that grade.

Every person n the sports teams would become smarter and the team would lean towards using their brain and not their brute strength so much. People would start to strategise and the sports teams would start to get better. Over all this is just a great decision for the school that will not only help the academic portion, but it will also help the athletes of the school. They will boost their grades and they would boost their ability to strategise, and there fore their ability to go further in life, and not just as an athlete.",0,persuade_corpus,1

People all over the world have died due to people using there phone while driving to justify that its alright for people to use their phone while driving is wrong people should learn that when your going about 80 in a rolling death box the last thing you need to look at Is your phone.

Just a little over 4000 people in 2018 died or caused death while they were using their phone and driving, that may seem like a small number, but those crashes caused at least $129 billion or 15% of over all societal damage.

"Advice. Advice can be important to many people, and most of the time they ask multiple people for it. Seeking advice can sometimes be hard and asking multiple people can help you reach your final decision. Asking multiple people of their opinion helps someone make a better choice because they have more options, quicker and easier to get a final decision, and make an overall smarter choice.

Firstly, asking for multiple opinions gives you more options to choose from and more to think about. A lot of people are going to say a lot of different things about your situation. This gives you more options to make a better choice in the end. The more options you have, the more possibilities there are and then choose the one you think is best. It also gives you the opportunity to use the process of elimination for options you don't consider to be helpful. This can help for any situation you may be in.

Secondly, asking for multiple pieces of advice makes the decision making process a lot quicker and easier. The reason it would be easier is that the people you ask, have probably been in the same situation you are in. It is also a quicker process because other people can help you through it instead of going in alone. This is really helpful for most people because some situations are nearly impossible to do alone. It takes nearly twice as long if you were to figure out a solution on your own.

Lastly, multiple opinions can help you make an overall smarter choice. Sometimes, other people have the best answers to your problems. You can make a smarter choice by asking multiple people because most of the time, they have the answers. It is easier to make a smarter choice by getting help when you need it. All of the other advice leads into this one. I feel you can use all of these stratogies to get to the smartest choice you can. When making a decision be sure to ask othe people.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice can be really helpful to most, if not, all people. It is never easy approaching a problem by yourself which is why you should always ask for help. Asking others for advice can sometimes be the best option because you have more options to choose from while in the decision making process, you can make a decision easier and quicker, and you can arrive to an overall smarter choice from others.",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, I am in eighth grade and a student of SCHOOL_NAME.

I feel that all students should participate in community service. I feel they should participate in community service because it would look very good on their college application. Another reason why I said all students should participate in community service is because if some of us students aren't told to do something like, pick up trash then the trash will still be sitting their until we graduate. Some students will be glad to community service and some students will refuse or as they say ""buck."" I feel that most students that have been doing what suppose to be doing and also has been helping around the school should be rewarded.

Some students think community service is a punishment, but it's not. I know sometimes you think picking up trash is nasty but it's not only helping you, but it's helping the community and your planet. Not all community service is picking up trash sometimes it's recycling or car pooling or even just turning off a light when you leave a room. I also think everyone should do community service because wouldn't it be nice for a change to see all students do work.

Community service to me is a change. We make changes everyday, but when we make those changes think about the world and how you should help it. If it was up to me community service would be the only options, because some students have time to come out and do community service but some chooses to go home and dent the couch, and that's just selfish. TEACHER_NAME you know when you tell us to do what we are suppose to do, it goes threw one ear and out the other. Why waste anymore time making suggestions and start making orders.

"To the Senator of Florida,

""The founding fathers established... the Constitution"" to make sure that there was a way to vote for one elector to portray the role of President of the United States of America. However, this action has resulted in electors to lose even though they won the popular vote, the age of the electoral college, and there are numerous possibilities of ties. In the United States there are hundreds of millions of people who want to keep the United States a democracy, but the United States may change their stand point.

Popular votes are collected from the people of the United States. With stating this, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This is because voters will be able to have only their votes taken into consideration. For example, the President of the United States is the offical who sends people to places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran to fight for our country. These people vote for the elector they want to send them over seas instead of the politicians in the electoral college system voting for who they want to be the president. There are only 538 electors to vote for the elector they desire and that is still more important than the millions of people that vote. ""We are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" is a part of the Declaration of Independence and the right of liberty involves our right as people to vote.

The electoral college has be are for hundreds of years, but with the age of the system comes problems. In modern times, we have to make slight changes to our government so the United States does not get held back from when the Constitution was first created. Things are meant to change and so is the electoral college because over time thins changes to better and more efficient things. ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" This evidence exclaims that there was a problem with the electoral college 15 years ago, which means that it can happen again.

Furthermore, the electoral college already has problems and there can be more with the possibilities of a tie. It states, ""perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.,"" this is not a democratic thing because democracy has to do with the vote of people, not the vote of the legislature. Also, in source 2, it exclaims that ""the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."" This is a dangerous situations because if a tie occurs the popular vote still won't be taken into consideration as much as the electoral votes.

To conclude, the electoral college system should be abolished because it does not benefit the citizens of the United States. The elecotral college takes away the popular vote of the people, is way too old to still be around, and there are possibilities of a tie. I don't want my President to be voted in based on the votes of the legislature. The electoral college should be abolished!

"The author uses a lot of clear evidence to discribe how the scientists are tring to study Venus. Also, the author discribes the dangers of doing so. The author also tells us what the problems are with studing Venus. The real question is, is it really worth it?

One of the biggest problems with exploring Venus is that Venuses aptnosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide and the timperatures average over 800 degrees. Another problem is that the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than here on earth. Also Venus is some times mistaken for a star because the plannet is so bright.

At one point Venus would have had features just like earth and have water surounding it. Venus is also known as the the twin to earth because they are so similar in features. NASA would send shipes into space and go to Venus but they could never lang on Venus. They haven't had a succesful space travel to Venus in 30 years. NASA is thinking about sending a blimp like craft to venus and have it hover over Venus at like 30 miles off the ground. Even at 30 miles off the ground the tempurtures will be around 170 Fahrenheit.

With what the passage states it is safe to say that there are a lot of dangers NASA would have to address before they launch another space ship to Venus. But also there are a lot of possibilities that NASA has when they launch the space ship to Venus. NASA can be the ones who discovered Venus, also they could learn more about Venus and why it lost all its earth like features.

In conclusion, the idea of learning more about Venus is a great opportunity to learn more about the planets around us. Also, learning about how Venus lost the Earth like features is a good way to learn about our planet and how to keep Earth from becoming that way. This idea of risking everything to go and explore Venus is a great opprtunity for us at earth to learn about how other planets like ours were destroyed.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I  belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. Also the problem comes up that the candidates do no go to there state thus never seeing them.

To began with I belive we should remove the Electoral Colleges. For the reson that voter are not voteing but for a slate of electors. Who then elect the president, for example ""if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.""(qoute form source 2) Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. ""Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (qoute form source 2). So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, ""and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Also another reason why we should remove the Electoral Colleges is for the reason that voters may become confuse and vote for the wrong person.

Futhermore we should remove the Electors Colleges, because its unfair to the voters. For example the winner takes all system in each state. Candidates don't spend times in the states they know they have no chance winning. ""It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" (qoute from source 3). But then what happens to the people in that wants to vote for them but can't because there votes go toward a slate of electors that votes for the other party. They focus on the swing states mostly. For Instance a Presidential race that happen were the electoral votes caused a certain party to win was. In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Hore received more in dividual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. The electoral votes need to be removed because it causes problems in elections which makes any side able to win even though they don't have more individual votes. Another example is ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast on him."" (qoute from sorce 3) .  Study shows that 60% of voters would prefer a direct election rather then what they have now.

On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states. If you elect a good representive that you belive, and trust that will vote to your liking. Someone that would not turn his back on the will of the people then it would not be that bad. The process they go throught maybe difficult and hard to understand. So it could be a good thing they take the hard work off our backs and do it for us to save us the time and hardwork. The Electoral Colleges requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal rather then a single region appeal.

To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"When people want or need advice on a situation, we tend to ask multiple people. But why do we want several opinions? People always want to hear more than one person's advice, so they can hear different stories or get different information, because the knowledge and experience one person has might be more helpful than last person's. Whether it is regarding the medical field, negative relationships, Which college to go to, or finding which Mexican restraunt is the best, there is always someone to ask with more experience, there could always be a better way, and seeking multiple opinions can definitely help you make the right decision.

A common reason that people ask several people for advice is different knowledge or education. Let's say you feel sick at school, so you go to the school clinic. The small office you walk into smells like Lysol wipes and empty dreams. after taking your temperature, the nurse gives you a ice pack, says you have a cold and tells you to ask your parent to buy cold medicine. You feel very sick though and you know it isn't from a cold. You decide to get a second opinion, when you get home, you ask your mom to drive you to the doctor. She drives you to the doctor's office and when you get inside you wait in the waiting room for about twenty minutes. When your name is called, the doctor asks you questions about how you feel and then she looks in your eyes, ears, throat and nose. Then she takes your temperature and listens to your breath. She diagnoses you with pneumonia and you go home with a antibiotic. If you hadn't gotten a second opinion you could have gotten very sick, and even spread it to others at school. Because of the second opinion you got from someone with a better education in the medical field, you were able to be cured and stop yourself from going to school and getting classmates sick.

A person also tends to ask several people for advice because of the contrasting personal experiences they had. My friend and I both had different experiences with two girls who were occasionally fun, but usually very petty and dramatic. The four of us had been a friend group together for almost two years, when they started getting far too sensitive to anything possibly offensive without a chance of forgiveness. My friend ended up leaving the group because he could not handle all the fighting anymore. I stayed for another year until they kicked me out, saying that their feelings do not mean enough to me. The last thing that they ever said to me on our group text message was, ""ask the wizard for a heart.'' My friend and I both regretted the decisions we made. When he left the group, he had no other friends so he was usually lonely. He said being sad alone is worse than being sad in company. But I wish I had left earlier because I am a very introverted person and it is rare that I find anyone I am even willing to talk to. I wish I left earlier so I would not be so close with them, so I would care much less about the loss of our friendship. If someone were to ask me and my friend for advice on a friend group like this one, I would say leave and he would say stay. The experiences we had are the things that make our advice more valuable than the advice of someone speaking only from preference.

Preference and opinion are also reasons why people ask for advice from many others. Some people treat asking for advice like it is a vote. If somebody was going to a party and she had a blue dress and a red dress, but couldnt decide which one to wear, she would probably ask several friends. The girl would then wear the dress with the most votes. Opinions matter a lot to some people and even if the girl ended up liking the red dress best, If the majority of people like the blue one better, she would probably still wear blue. However, opinion varies and can not be counted on like education and experience can be. The mindsets and preference of others change the advice they give. Another way you can benefit from asking many people's advice is because it helps avoid bias. For example, if you were asking for advice on which girl to ask to a dance, the blonde or the brunette, and you asked your friend who has a brunette girlfriend, he would probably say brunette. Or if you wanted advice on what type of pet to get, a dog or a cat. Your friend who owns a dog would say to get a dog, because its his preference. That is bias. To avoid that, people ask for multiple opinions. So that not everyone they ask owns a dog, or has a brunette girlfriend.

There are multiple times in life where people need advice, the benefits that have been listed in this essay are just a few reasons why the common instinct of asking several people for advice is so beneficial. When you have a problem that you need some advice on, think about the things said in this essay. Hopefully everything said about preference, opinion, education and experience helped you learn that there are many benefits to asking for advice from several people.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Here are some reasons people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You get to move cattle,travel places,help people.

Traveling would be fun and here are some reasons why. Places, you could go to asia and see their art, or Europe and meet the people. Food, you could try exotic things like goat or fresh Polish sausge. People, you could meet new people and hang out with your new best german buddy eating goat.

Moving cattle would be fun ecpecially if you grew up doing it just like Luke did. You could get smarter by doing this you would know how much of what to give a horse or a cow for feed, and you would know how to clean a stall. If you ever retired you could go into cattle from this experience.

If you did this you could have the experience of traveling and cattle but the best one would be knowing you helped all those people stay alive milk and meat from the cows meat from the goat. everyone would love you for giving them food and milk to eat and drink to keep them alive.

"Being able to attend class every day isn't always the easiest things for some students. Life just gets in the way sometimes. School also takes around 6 hours out of a students day which leaves them very little time to do anything else. One thing some schools are doing is offering students the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students could benefit if schools offered distance learning as an option because online classes eliminate the need for a student to be present in class, gives them more time in the day to do other important things and can even help teach a student some responsibility.

Giving the students the option to take classes online allows for them to still get work done and on time even if they are sick, have doctors appointments, or even have a family emergency.

Some students may even miss a few days to even a week of class leading to them having a large amount of work they have to make up while also doing the work that the teachers are currently assigning. Allowing students to take classes online can help students eliminate the physical attendance factor and lets the student work from nearly anywhere with a computer and internet connection. And having the ability to have classes online means a student can help reduce the amount of missing assignments which would overall help improve their grades.

Online courses also give the student more free time in the day to do other important things. For example, some students work jobs to try to raise money for college but often dont get paid very much due to the little amount of time they get to go to work. With the opportunity to take class online, a student can get most or all of their schoolwork done in a smaller portion of the day and still have plenty of time in the day to go work, take care of younger siblings, and tend to other important things. Most students have to sit in a school for up to 6 hours a day, but with the option of having online classes a student could get schoolwork done within a couple hours and have the whole day to do what they need to do. Being able to get schoolwork done in a smaller amount of time benefits students because it gives them more time in the day to do what they want or need to do.

One issue that one could argue against giving students the option to take classes from home is that some kids may not be responsible in doing their work because of distractions or lack of motivation because of a less structured environment. While this is true, it is the students responsibility to make sure their work is done and turned in on time, even in regular public schools. And while the online classes may be less structured, online courses usually have required times that a student must be active which would provide some structure for the student to get their work done. But having a less structured teaching environment could actually help make the student more responsible because the student will be given due dates and requirements that must be met, otherwise they would start to fail the course. And learning responsibility is a great thing for students as a way to prep for college and life outside of school. Having online classes as an option still benefits students, even tho less structured, it still teaches some responsibility.

Students are likely to miss a few days of school, and some work jobs and have to help with family income. The option for students to take their classes online is very beneficial to them. Life just gets in the way sometimes, but giving choice to take online classes can significantly help students. There isnt much of a downside to these forms of classes. Overall schools that offer online classes to students benefit them by giving them more time to take care of their own things outside of school, recover from illnesses, and inadvertently teach them to be a little more responsible.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principal

I think students shouldn't have at least a B average on their grade to participate in sports or other activities because, some students try very hard in school but don't have good grades. Also lots of students like sports or any other activities but they don't have the grades for it.

Finally its just not fair to students that have bad grades but are good and intelligent that they have to improve to be able to participate in a activity.

There are students that try very hard in school but cant get higher than a C on their grade, wile others don't even have to try to get an A.

But some students try even harder than students that have an A but they can only get a C. Its not easy to get a good grade you have to try but sometimes when you try your hardest it doesn't work out.

Lots of students love to participate in activities, its good to stay active and to have fun in school. But when some of that fun is taken away because you don't have a specific grade it can become a problem for some students.

Those are the reasons that students shoulent have good grades",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Its hard reading peoples facial expressions. Some people dont have the type of face where others can take a peek at their face and know whether they are happy or upset. Life just is not that easy. Although being able to read someones facial expressions can get in a way of teaching a student, make others feel bad, and perhaps the technology can misenterpret a facial expression.

Students and teachers alike may feel highly uncomfortable knowing that technology is veiwing their face at every point of the day. Humans now live in the 20th century where technology is booming and will continue to improve. In the article it states that a computer classroom will be able to defrentiate ones emotions and change an ad to best fit the persons prefrences (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). Thats fine and dandy until they change from ads to actual lessions. Lets say that a student is watching a class video independently as are the other students. Perhaps the video is for biology and what is being shown is a dissected frog. Of course watching a frog being dissected can make some students disgusted, but in the end of the day the student still has to learn all this since it is required in the class. Perhaps in order to achieve a good grade in the class the student has to sit through and watch that video to learn.

Having technology constantly viewing ones facial expressions can be pretty unfortunate. The technology can apparently know if someone is happy or sad (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). If it can tell if someone is happy or sad can it tell if someone is lying? Lets say a female student asks the teacher for permission to use the restroom. Perhaps this teacher is strict and does not allow restroom passes unless necessary. Telling the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her mentrual cycle is embarrassing for younger female students; even more so if the teacher happens to be a male. Now having technology that can pinpoint the fact that this female student does not have to urinate would be classified as a lie. Therefore the teacher would say no knowing she is lying about having to pee. This of course puts the female student in a difficult position; leaving her to feel bad and embarrassed about being caught in a lie. There are two choices now she doesn't go to the restroom and risks staining hersle with blood or she tells the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her period and be embarrassed about that too. Having this technology can be greatly embarrassing for many other students too.

Technology is bound to mess up at one point. All humans and technology are not perfect. There is not such thing as perfect, so having technology that reads human expressions around may be cool until is messes up and reads ones expression incorectly. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...,"" (""Making Mona Lisa Smaile""). For exapmle if a student is intrigued by a subject and understanding what is being taught then there is no real reason for the subject to be changed. Imagone that a student sitting in class deeply engrossed in the sunject to vome to school the nect day and have to sit through a boring lession just because a computer read their expression wrong.

It is normal to be excited over new technology. People need to be level headed though and ask themselves whether or not it will be beneficient towards whatever purpose the technology is bought for. The new software Facial Action Coding System can be pretty appeasing when thinking of it at first. Actually owning it and installing it in a classroom can lead to bad consequences like: A student not learning well, making others feel bad, and the risk of the software making mistake.

"I think that could be a good idea attend classes from home by way of online or video for the students that can not eat before go to school because they no have time get the bus, students want extra credits, and can take the time that they want in online classes.

Examples:

I don't eat breakfast before go to school, because I don't have time to do it or I will loss my bus. Because is normal see a student come to late for the bus, and when I talk with others students they always tell me that they are hungry, so this new way ""class online"" can benefit to us.

Some students want extra credit to get a better diploma so this be more easy for these students, or also can help for students that failed a class, because sometimes friends tell me retake this class or he can't graduate so this other fact why its a good idea this new way to teach to the students.

Students need to do something like go to hospital, get sick, or other thing can happen in their life, they will loss class and this can affect on their grades, so I think if we get online class this could not happen because every class is recording so when the student have the time to do the class online or watch the videos that they have to, they will keep their grades higher and dont worry about grades no more.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"A summer project would be an absolute horrible idea. Much less leaving it up to student to choose there project ideas would be even worse. It would be difficult for student to complete a project all on there own with no guidance during summer break. That is why I think that a required summer projects should be teacher-designed,because if the project is student designed it is likely that the project will not get completed,not be inquisitive or won't meet requirements.

First of all,During summer break the thought of school goes out the window. Students focus on other things like summer jobs. A summer job would take a lot of the students time,energy and focus away from being able to choose a project idea. It is likely that the student would not complete the project if it was up to them to decide what they want to do for a project idea. The summer project would have to be teacher-designed or the student would likely not even begin nor will they be able to complete it.

Second of all,having a project that is inquisitive and keeps the students interest would be important. It would be vital that the project be difficult enough so it will challenge students,because if it does not than the project has no purpose. I think that if a choice for a challenging project is left up to students,they will more than likely choose a project that is not at all challenging. The teacher must design a project for the class so the students will use their brain over the the summer and keep them doing something so simple it,s pointless.

Finally,if a school project is left up to students, there is a possibility that it would no meet the requirements of the teacher. The students could be doing something entirely wrong and have no way of knowing until it is too late. Also if the school project is not teacher designed,the students may use the wrong materials to complete the project. It would be best for the teacher to choose a project for the class. This way all the students will know what is required of them.

in conclusion,Teachers should design summer projects,because students would likely get lost in their summer break,and the project will end up either incomplete,not challenging enough or won't meet the teachers requirements. I think if the school system decided to do summer project they would have to be teacher-designed so the students know what they are doing. when school lets out for the summer student do not think to much about projects and school work.

in order for summer projects to be a success the teacher would need to design the project.             ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear, state senator I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think this because the Electoral College does not seem fair, the president that usually wins in popular vote loses to the vote for presidency, it is considered a non-democratic method for selecting a president, and it is all up to the electors of a candidate. The Electoral College should also be changed to popular vote because it is not the people who are choosing the president, it is the three electors sent from each different state.

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is not fair to the candidates. This is because most presidents that win the popular vote section of the election then end up losing the presidential vote section, an example of this is when candidate Al Gore recieved the most individual votes when running against George W. Bush, but Bush won the electoral section, recieving two hundred and seventy-one against Al Gore's two hundred and sixty-six. The Electoral college is also unfair to voters, because of all of the states winner take-all system of government, and in seventeen states they did not get a chance to see the candidates. Most people believe the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, a person named Bob Dole, believes that the Electoral College should be completely abolished. Another big problem in the Electoral College is segregationists who do everything to go against certain parties and their candidates, like the time in 1960 a group of segregationists almost succeeded in their effort to get rid of all democratic electors so that new electors would be opposed to John F. Kennedy.

The Electoral College should also be changed to election by popular vote, because people consider it non-democratic. This is because the voting is all up to the electors selected by each of the different states, meaning that the actual people of the state have no power in the election of the candidates for president. When the people of the state take their vote for the candidates they are actually voting for potential electors who will then go represent the selected candidate, this gives rise to problems like corrupt electors who are dishonest and using cheating tactics, also most states know that their votes will do nothing to help the candidates being represented, examples would be the Democrats in Texas and the Republicans in California. It is also believed that the Electoral College makes potential voters not want to vote at all and they end up not representing their candidates. And most people already have a certainty of the outcome of the election, meaning they already know who will win the election based on the number of votes so far in the popular votes section and the electoral section. The system of electors is also not fair because the people can not control who they are voting for has the electors, and the states number of electors are equal to the number of people on its congressional delegation, which gives big states an advantage over small states.

To conclude this letter, I again say that the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote because, popular vote is fairer then the Electoral College, the people have no power compared to the electors and the are subject to corruption with in the system.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" This is important because some students wont ask for help when they are confused or troubled. Secondly, more than often when a student is bored they will fall asleep causing them to miss important information. ""By weighing the different units, the software can even recognize mixed emotions.""So if a student is a little cofused the software wont make it ""just so easy"" but it'll reduce the challenge.

If uniterested in the subject at hand or with the class as a whole they will become unattached an fail the class potentially causing them not to graduate. ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" By modifying the subject or lesson it could make it easier or make it harder for a student in class. If a person seems to be frowning the software could ease up. Also if the student is having a good time with the software it's a possability that it could make it a little harder.

Even people that dont use much emotion in their face the software will still be able to calculate their emotions. ""The facial expressions for each emotions are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" So if a student isn't very exspressive this software will still be able to calculate their emotions with the slightest movement of their facial structor. ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" So even the slightest change is detected. When detected the software will switch the level of challenge.

In closing this software is a very important improvement to schools everywhere. The software will help you stay interested and connected with the lesson.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"There are very many pros & cons on why ""Driverless Cars"" would be a good thing.

I can name a lot of good and bad things about them. I am here to tell you my position, & to tell you pros & cons on this situation. These things can be very helpful in deciding whether these cars are a idea or not. Everybody may have different opinions on this situation.

Personally I think driverless cars could be good & bad. Here's why. Driverless cars could benefit a lot of people in many ways , for example if you are running late and you dont have time to do something before you leave the house you can do it in the car. On the other hand its a bad thing because they say the car tell you when it needs human assistance, but what if you're so busy doing the thing you were doing while you were runnning late you don't pay attention to the car telling you it needs your assistance. So before you know it you end up in a accident.

Some people think that the car isnt a good idea. They believe that ""the only safe car is the one that has a human driver in control at all times"". I see why they would think that . Considering the fact that all of this is running off of technology, who's to say that something horrible is going to happen. Technology malfunctions all the time , so what makes people think that these driverless cars are any different. So there's a problem with a car running off of technology. They say that they plan to have these problems solved , & a handful of car companies plan to have cars that drive by themselves in a few years, but they get closer to where they want to be with this everyday.

Thats how I feel on the situation of driverless/smart cars. Until they get all the problems under control & get everything to the point where no one has to wonder about what would happen in a certain situation, I think that they are a bad idea. They have good reasoning on why they should be made but the list of why they shouldnt overshines that.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System is a very good and valuable resource to use. I think that it could benefit society and schools very well because then they could tell if a student likes school or does not, tell if the undertsand a lesson or not, and just know how they are feeling throughtout each class so that the school or place can try to fix it. They can even make adjustments according to the students emotions on the internet.

I think that if we had this new technology in our schools it could benefit us a lot. In school you can finally tell if someone truly likes it or just puts on a fake smile to fool everyone else. The new (FACS) system can help to determine how a child or adult feels during every hour of everyday. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" You can tell if your classmates are sad or happy or however they feel around you and just in the school place in general. If someone in school is sad or mad we can finally understand and try to get them the help that they need before the situation worsens.

The new (FACS) system would also benefit the school system by telling if a child is confused or not. In class everyone has gotten bored and just stops thinking sometimes. ""A clssroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The classroom would change forever because then people will not be embaressed to say that they are confused because the computer will adjust the lesson for you if you look confused. This is a great way to make sure students get the help they need so they can move on and succeed.

Finally, we can predict how a person feels even if they just are looking into a computer. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Our own computers can pick out ads for us to enjoy based on our intrests and facial expressioin. Nobody likes ads but this can make ads more tolerable then to get and ad about something that you have no intrest in. Computers will understand non verbale communication because these days people text and talk on the phone there is really not much talking in person so the computer will know that you are happy or sad when on a certain page or watching a certain ad.

In conclusion i think that this is a great idea and is valuable to have these in schools. There are so many pros about having these in schools and they can and will benefit a lot of people and their lives. In class we no longer have to be shy we can get our lesson adjusted according to our own understanding not everyone else's understandings.         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I personally think that completely driveless cars are a bad idea. As a 16 year old, I'm finally the legal age to receive my licenses, but I can't receive my licenses if I don't have a car to drive. With driveless cars, we are literally allowing cars to think for us.

If driveless cars do become the new thing to have, what would the driver do? The driver would simply stop paying attention to the road, and the car would do everything for them. With the car doing everything for them, more drivers would focus their energy and attention somewhere else, causing more accidents. With more accidents, who would be at fault? Would it be the driver, or the company?

How will the laws be made in order to keep others safe if the car happens to break down? With actuall drivers driving a car their attention, and energy is on the road they're driving on. If they do cause an accident, there's cars that are made to prevent an accident before it happens.

Dear Principal ;

I'm asking you to change the school policy. I think it unfair to not let children participate in Sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Sport is a wonderful activities for kids to do. At school or after school , it wrong not lets kids be in sports because of there grade at school.

Many students have as their grade. Letting kids enter sports with at least an grade C , encourages kids to keep their grades at least to a C. Witch better way to have kids play sports after school , than watching t. v or gaming video games. Kids would be better at school and will have more interest. Will spend their more time playing sports. Kids would get together and will get along more. Will be more friendly to each other. Behavior will decrease due to sports.

It will be a better environment for kids in School. For this reason I think you should change the policy for the participate in sports. Kids will try their best at school and will not lower their grades. School will be a better place for students. More people would get along and be more kind. Would this be the best for us ?

"Dear Principal,

Firstly I believe that you should allow students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

I believe this, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME for my seventh grade year we were allowed to have our phones during lunch and other free time as long as it was in are lockers during classes.

Also then if students needed to call their parents to come and get during the school day when they couldn't remember their parents number, they could get a hold of them.

Secondly when students are allowed to have their phones during lunch and other free time the students most likely to keep their phones in their lockers during classes, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME the student who had phones in class was less.

That was a good thing so the teachers could go through all the lessons they had planned for this class period.

And thirdly then there was less students getting in trouble, and less cell phones getting taken away from the students.

That is why I believe that student should be allowed their phone during lunch and other free times, thank you for your time.

"Dear senater

I think you should change the election to the most popular vote because, the citizens should have a say on who they want running the country, it would make the process of voting for a new president a lot easer, and it will encorage more people to vote.

I think you should change the election to the most popular vote because, the citizens should have a say on who they want running the country. Citizens should be able to make this choice because they are the ones that have to live with any new laws that are passed and made my the president. If the people voted for the president and the one they voted for one it would make them happy and exited to see what he will do with the country. If you where a voter and you only had the chance to vote for somebody that would vote for him thats not fare you would want to vote for the president yourself.

Another reason why I think you should change the election to most popular vote is it would make the process of voting for a new president a lot easer. It would make it a lot easer by not having to vote for one person to vote for the president. In this procces there is multiple steps to doing it and I think it is a huge hastle to go through it when you could just let the citizens decide. If you did change it this way it would cost less money and stress on the people that have to help with this long proccess.

My last reason why I think you should change the election to the most popular vote is because, it would encourage more people to vote. Right now people dont really care if they vote or not because some feel like they really have no say in it. The people would care about voting more if ther vote was going to who will the next president be this makes them want to vote. Imagine if you where a voter would you really want to go vote for somebody thats not going to be the president? If you change it and let citizens decide you will have a lot more voters.

I think you should change the election to the most popular vote is because, the citisens should have a say on who they want running the country, it would make the procces of voting for a new president a lot easer, and it will encourage more people to vote.

"Emotions can reveal a lot about what is going through someone's mind. When a person is wearing a neutral face on, it is hard to tell what emotion they are feeling. Now there is technology to help decipher what that perosn is feeling. Dr. Paul Eckman has created a process when a computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face to tell what emotion is on it, Facial Action Coding System or FACS.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the use of Facial Action Coding Sytem (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable education wise and emotionally.

Knowing a student does not understand or is uninterested in a topic can help teachers in a tremendous way. If there is

""a classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson"" (D'alto). By modifying the lesson, the teacher will make a change to the lesson. After changing the lesson to an easier way for some students to understand, it can help the students grades. When a student is bored of the topic, the teacher can fix the lesson to be more interesting.

Not only will education be better for students, but emtionally they will feel a lot better. Dr. Eckman designs his system with the basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (D'alto). In classrooms, students may show emotions other than being bored or confused, but show something is wrong with them. Teachers can be notified that a student may seem troubled and can assist emotional support. Humans can tell when their friends are feeling by just giving a glance, but some may have trouble telling what emotion the other person is feeling (D'alto). With a new computer software that stores similar anatomical information as electronic code, created by Dr. Huang, a classroom computer is able to tell what emotion a student is feeling (D'alto). Teachers may not be close with some students, so they are unable to tell what the stduent is feeling. However, the computer can signal that a student is feeling a certain way to the teacher.

Students can excel education wise and emotionally due to the use of technology to read their emotional expressions in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"".

Currently, students are becoming to feel sad or unwated, and tradies will unleash in school. With technology one step ahead, it is able to stop students from feeling unsafe, sad, or confused.     ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The Author describe how you can see emotions in the image of Monalisa. Many peaple can to think that the Monalisa is happy because she's smile but she can have fews emotions in the same moment. Leonardo Da Vinci's try to speak in this image that the emotions is how a mirror. Is for this the Author speak in the article that Lonardo Da Vinci probably knows study the emotion of person. I think you can see the emotios the other peaple because the face is how a mirror. you can look how you feeling in the moment. Is you are tired, sick, sad, happy, disgusted...

But sometimes we can't see all the emotions, because Monalisa looks that she is happy but she can feel others emotions that you can't see maybe.

My conclusion is you can see the emotions in the face but NO all the emotions.

This happen with the expressions of my classmate they look very serious for the exam, others look tired but they maybe can be others emotions that I don't know.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"No one starts off knowing what to do in life, you can't be sure until you've tried many different things. That's why I think Each student should have to participate in extracurricular activities outside of their classes in school. Extracurricular activities are a great way to engage students brain's in subjects they're passionate about and is also a good way for students to find new hobbies. Without the students being exposed to many different activities they might never find their talent and what they want to pursue in life.

After school activities are a great way to keep the brain working even after the school day is over. Students can stay active whilst doing something they are passionate about like a sport or community service. For instance I do yearbook in school as one of my electives and sometimes I like to work on designs, quotes, and formatting at home. This is a great way to stay active by doing something that I like and something that benefits the school as well.

Putting students out of their comfort zones by encouraging them to try new things is also a great way for students to find activities that want to pursue. Maybe someone has played soccer ever since they were in second grade and they've never tried basketball, however when they get to middle school they finally try basketball and realize they love it. You can never be sure that you dont want to do something until you try it. For instance Lebron James didnt know he wanted to play basketball until he was introduced to it so you never know if your going to be the next star.

If every student did one or more extracurricular activity everyday the school could accomplish so many more projects. Students would be encouaged to pursue topics they're passionate about and would have the freedom of choice and they would also find new things they love doing and create new expiriences. All they need is a little encouagement.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Most schools don't make their students participate in after school activities, but mine dose.

I don't agree with the choice and hears why.

Students have to sit at school and behave for eight hours a day. So when its time to finally time to go home and spend time with family and relax were excited. When you make us do extracurricular actives we don't get that time at home to relax and spend time with are family. I think we sometimes forget that everyone needs there own personal time to them self.

Although thats a big part of why I disagree with my principal I still have more to say. Some students may not have a ride to these extracurricular actives or a ride to get back home. Which could bring stress to the students parents. I may not be a parent myself but I know being a parent can be very stressful. Many parents work late night shifts. In which they can't be there to pick up their son or daughter.

My third and most important reason is that kids should be kids. We deserve to go outside and play and play video games. We deserve a childhood not being a miniature adult with lots extra tasks to do and think about. We need this time now to grow and be kid because in the real world they're a much bigger consequent then being grounded. Theses extracurricular activities are taking up all our time and a lot of us don't even like the activity we have.

All in all, we should'nt be forced to do something we don't want to. It should be optional to join a extracurricular activity. I just wish my principal would have looked at his chose from different points of view.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Required Essay

The average person uses their phone many times a day whether it be consciously or not, we as a people always have access to our own devices. The problem with people using their phone is when to use it and how to use it properly. When inside of a vehicle there should only be a bare minimum of use to your phone. Whether that reason would be an emergency call or even doing simple things like using the maps application. All in all, humans as a whole should be able to use their phones but only to an extent.

The use of a phone in a car could be proven to be fatal but there are good reasons to use said phone, only in certain situations. One of the reasons would be that to use your phone to get your way through areas you have no idea how to get through or using your phone to find your way home from a place you have no knowledge on. The downside is that when the person glances at the phone to see where to turn or make a specific move they lose the focus on the road for a split second which could be fatal. Sometimes the use of a phone all depends on what kind of person it is.

The person themselves also plays a big role in the use of cellphones in the car. The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses. The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone.

Phones play a big role in people's lives and it even saves them sometimes but the use of a phone is dangerous when the person is distracted on their phone. A second could save them from a life threatening accident. The amount of people that are in car accidents that involve phones is 26% in 2014. When the person is using their phone they are putting themselves and other people at risk on the road. According to the National Safety Council, the use of cell phones when driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually.

Texting while driving would be the biggest issue when it comes down to the use of a cell phone. According to the NHTSA, driving while texting is six times more dangerous than driving drunk. Also texting while driving is now the lead cause of teen deaths in the USA, more than 3000 teens die each year alone as a result of sending a test message to somebody while they are in the use of a car. The amount of consequences for just the use of a phone is just not enough, is the phone as important as the person's life? It should never come down to that question because your life is way more valuable than sending a text to someone while driving.                                                  ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I'm going to tell you why you should join or why you should't join the program. I'll be giving my reason and also Luke's reasons to support my claim. I will be arguing on why others should join the program.

Others should join the program because you get to travel around the world. Luke stated that he went to China and Europe! He traveled the Pacific and Atlantis ocean several times. He's been to Greece. If you like to travel, this would be a great program to join.

Luke feeds and waters the animals. Luke has to check on the animals every hour. I would join this program because I'm an animal person and I would love to spend weeks, maybe even months with these animals. Others who aren't animal people maybe shouldn't join this program. It would be a great way to interact with the animals if you don't like animals al that much.

Joining this program could teach you something. It could teach you many things. It could teach you to be more cautious about things. As Luke stated ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" This program can make you more grateful for everything. It could make you work harder instead of being lazy. You could actually get things done if you were to join this program. That is why I think you should join.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Do you think it is important to have school clubs? because a lot of people like it and dislike it. At Generic_School they are having a vote for should they have clubs or they should not. Do you think it is important to have one well I do and here are the reasons.

You can make new friends! This is a big one because some people dont know how to get friends. This is a good way because if you join a club that has the same in tress! Evidence shows that at Shepherd university said that students have made more friends through clubs or something outside of school. A other study at Shepherd shows that that are in clubs have more friends than kids in no club.

Clubs can make you relaxed and more happy about your self. At Boston collage they have found kids in clubs are more relaxed than kids in no club. Dr. Newman said ""When I went there the kids were relaxed and happy, Then when I went to a other school with no clubs they seemed stressed"". Boston collage also studied that kid that have a higher self a steam will do better in school.""The kids that are more happy will get better grades and the kids that arent as happy will get lower grades"". said Dr. Newman. He also said ""That is not the case all the time"".

There are a lot of types of clubs to! ""At Generic_School there are tons of clubs"". Said Generic_Name the principle for the school. There is RC club, foursquare club, book club, snake club, and many others! Generic_Name said ""There are clubs for every student!"" So it seems like you can have a club for everyone! This helps students relax and have lots of fun with your friends. ""Generic_School has been doing this for years, Also the students think it is great!"" said Generic_Name.

But what if the kids are behind on work is there a club for that? And what if a kid does not like to be in a club so what are they going to do? At Florida state university a studie has shown that some kids use the clubs to go to the bathroom and just stay in there the hole time. This can make the kids have bad habets. So the kids that are behind on work will just have to wait till they get home. What happens if the kid does not have a good house hold and he cant get his work done because of it.

Well thats why they have the homework club. you can do any work you can in there! Like math, science, english, civics, art, and many others! At Generic_School a kid named Generic_Name said ""I get all my work done in there and when were done we read or study for a test! The kids that dont want to do a club will still get to pick a club but they will chose homework mostof the time.

In the end it seems like clubs are a great thing and they help out with students health! They also seem to be more happy and relaxed. The kids in the homework club like it because they can get help from multible teachers. Do you think it is important to have one well I do and here are the reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"When looking for important advice you usually have a ""go to person"" and then multiple people around you that you ask what to do in the problem you are having. Talking with more than yourself, one other person, or five other people is an amazing thing to do because if you only talk to one person about your troubles than they may get annoyed with you or could be a fake friend. When you have more conversation with people are what you are think you can see both perspectives, you have more knowledge to what you are talking about, and lastly, improving your life skills. If you have something on your mind always look to talking with family and friends about it, even if you have different point of views.

You may not think about it all of the time but you are very bias to what you like including, food, drinks, pets, names, school, you name it. You can do it whenever, it is like asking someone if they like dogs or cats better, most people are quick to jump to the answer and that is bias towards the animal that they like better. When you talk to other people even that are not like you, you can see why other people like dogs or cats and their pro's to it. It's just like taking a poll in the classroom or bar graphing who is wearing a different type of shoe, but you are taking the knowledge and exporting it into your decision. So, next time talk to other people so your not bias and you get to see the positive and negative of your decision.

Have you ever heard of the quote ""The more you know the better you are off,"" Unknown. That quote is one-hundred percent true because you gain so much more brainpower when talking to others. Most adults when they are having a hard time deciding something they ask other adults, and that usually brings down the negative part. What they don't understand is when you ask a kid they can turn your idea into something brilliant that you may of never thought of. Taking to kids is even more smart idea to do when it is something fun because then you can bring their fun into your idea and make it more exciting. Next time don't just talk to people your age, talk to everyone around you.

There are so many skills you need for life out there you can't count them all. It just happens that communicating with people is a huge life skill. More outgoing people don't even blink at the option to go and talk to someone when shyer people need a little help, and seeking other peoples opinions during school or outside of it is a great way to get people out of their shell. Talking to someone is more then a life skill it is a everyday skill and that is why it is so greatly important. The best way to improve at it is to do it.

The next time you want advise talk to more than yourself, one other person, or even five people. While you don't need to go and talk to everyone off of the street or who you walk by you don't only want your thoughts in your head. When seeking other peoples opinions you can see both points of view, have more knowledge and common knowledge, and finally have better life skills. Try it out and see how better your own opinions come, I'm sure they will come from weak one to stronger ones it a matter of days.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Cars have undergone many changes since they were first established. Since then what is reffered to by ""smog"" has severly incresed. ""Smog"" is also what is called greenhouse gas emissions. Over the years many countries have undergone ways to prevent car usage in effect to gradually reduce ""smog""

In Vauban Germany, many people dont use cars due to the fact that street parking, driveways, and even home garages are tipiclly forbidden. Some benifits are, less stress, ruduced greenhouse gas emissions, closer shopping areas and stores in walking distance. In Paris, peoples driving rights on Mondays as well as Tuesdays are being revoked by the number on the license plate. All this in effort to reduce smog. Failing to abide the rules of revoked driving led to a fine which many people recieved, then giving up cars. In Bogota Columbia, theres a program meant to reduce the ""smog"" as well. This being called ""Day without cars"". Violations to follow the day without cars also resulted to a fine.

In the United States of America people have seemed to loose interest in cars and license at that matter. The peak of miles driven was in the year of 2005, decreasing after that, our percentage rate was 9 percent below the peak of 2005 and equal to the time period of January 1995. The decrease has been assumed to be because of the recession. Since the amount of miles has decresed, and because the recession people have not been as interested with driving beause how much gasoline has costed. With amount of miles drivien in America decresed, in Columbia, the a amount of bicycle paths had increased to 118+ miles.

Cars are on of the biggest greenhouse gas emission producers, in France, Diesel fuel was blamed because it was a favored from a tax policy. Paris tipically has the most smog due to the increased use of diesel fuel. Paris' amount of smog was 147 micrograms of particulate matter compared to a low of 79.7 micrograms of particulate matter in London. Usages of cars are going down all over the world. therefore reducing the amount of smog greatly.

The way many countries have new and improved ways to reduce the amount of smog is incredible. Cars are now being used less, biking, hiking, walking, and bussing is now easier to do with what is happened. Car companies have come to advertising cars they wouldnt usually advertise, becuase they are not selling as many cars and they are trying to appeal to everyone. It has been said with driving less it relieves stress, and has been scientifically proven to ruduce the amount of smog. Many people are interested and cars and getting their license, but it just has not been a priority. There are many advantages to limiting car usage.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Im against this driveless car thing. Why would u want to have that kinda car to have but you reallycant drive it unless it tells u can. I see they point of when are coming from but personal i would have to say no.

The reason i saw no is becasue i like to drive and i have some reason why i think it not good. First reason is because what happen when ur in the car and when its driving it self down the road you may what to take a nap and your by yourself. Then whe nthe car is driving and it makes a mishap then your in trouble because its your car and you have to pay for it to get fix. The second reason is that when you think for awhile because in the passage it says "" Toyata prisu uses posisiton-estimatingon th eleft rear wheel, a roating sensoron the roof, a vidoe camera mountes near the rearview mirrior, four automative radar sensprs, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" Just because it has all those thing dosent mean it good to have a driverless car. What happens if one of those thing break down and next thing you know you dont have a sensors on the left rear wheel then what happen you crash. The thrid reason is because when are in the car to my personal reaction i want to be safe and want to be on the wheel and not have to car be pushing my gas pedel. What happens and the car gose to fast or to slow and since you have no control of what the car dose then it stil your fault to be in a crash with another car or in the ditch. When im in a car i like to be the one on the gas pedel and to be able to, control my car and not have it go automacly. It says in the passage "" in 2013, BMW announced the development of Traffic jam Assistant."" The car can handle driving functional at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sesors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" I also say "" They cansteer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the raod ahead requires human skills, such as navitgating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. his necessitates the car beign ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a promble occurs."" Hoe would the driver be noticefy that there was a promble hhow can the car do that if thye wold tell me why then i would understand and maybe be on there side.

That what i have to say about this driverless car i am not likeing the idea so when have to be ready to have a car be on the crash you will be in the promble to be able to get the money on how they would pay there car. So there one im not on there side at all.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The fire tripled in size, and it had reached my ceiling before I knew it my whole kitchen was on fire. Here how it happened, I had asked my friend for advice on what should I do if the oil catches on fire. He told me to just pour water on it. The oil caught on fire, and I poured water on it, and you can guess what had happened, the fire tripled in size. Everyone agrees that we should always ask more than one person for advice, but sadly not everyone does it, and it can have daring consequences. I say that everyone should ask more than one person for advice because, it gives then more of a better understanding on the idea, you can see if someone is incorrect about the advice they gave you, and it is usually safer and better in general to ask for advice.

Asking more than one person for advice can give you a better understanding on the idea you are asking about, and it you can learn more. Lets say that for an example, you were asking about how to make your computer faster, and you learned new things about how a computer and how the parts of a computer work. For another example, you wanted to change your cars oil, but forgot which tube is the oil one. I ask someone for advice and know you know where the water or the liquid cooler goes just in case your car breaks down. For instance, you wanted to know where to put commas, so you ask for advice and after a couple of tries you now know where periods go instead of putting commas there. That is why it is better to ask more than one person for advice, because you can get a better understand of the idea and learn more.

Asking more than one person for advice is much better than just asking one person, because you can see if they are incorrect or not. For an example, I asked ten people if I can use eggs that have only been expired for a day. Everyone said no it is expired do not use it, except for one person who said it is okay to use, I was able to see that the one person that said it was okay most likely incorrect. For another instance, I asked my four of my friends if the mall is closed today, three of them said it is not closed, but one person said it is not closed yet. I can see that the person who said the mall is not closed yet is most likely wrong. Furthermore, I was not able to decide which car faster, so I can buy it for the race that is in two months, so I asked six of my friends for advice about which car is faster the BMW or Mercedes. five of them said the BMW but one of them said the Mercedes is faster, so that most likely means that the person who said the Mercedes is faster is incorrect.

Asking some people for advice instead of one person is better, because it is safer. For an example, I went to the doctor to see if I was sick, but the doctor said I was not sick, but I had showed symptoms of being sick, so I went to see two other doctors, and they both said I was sick, and I really was sick. For another instance, we were hiking in the woods when a venomous snake bite me. I urgently asked all of my friends for advice, one of my friends quickly advised me to suck the venom out, but the rest of my friends stopped me from doing it, and instead they put a really tight bandage around my leg. Now instead of losing my life I survived, because I had asked more than one person for advice. For the last example, I was modding a car, and I was going to buy a fake part, so I asked four of my friends about it. Three of my friends said do not buy it can make your car catch on fire, but one of my friends said it was okay. I did some research online and I had found out that the fake car part can actually make your car on fire.

Whoosh, the fire had tripled in size, and the whole kitchen had almost burned down. That all happened because I had asked only one person for advice instead of two or three or more. Before you do anything and you do not know exactly what to do, ask more than one person for advice it will be worth it in the long run. Asking more than one person for advice is much better because. you can get a better understanding of the idea and learn more, you can see who is incorrect, and it is much safer. That is why I state to always ask more than one person for advice.                          ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear, Principal

I think that your idea is good but i think it need some minor changes. This is indeed a great idea in the nutshell but there are some things that I must argue about. Such as the fact that some kids are just bad a school but great at sports, also it think that this rule should change when it come to the reasons as to why they have a C or a D.

Your idea is great but it need a bit of fine tuning along the lines of the mental capacity of the kids. There are some people that are the greatest of athletes in our school but some of them just cant learn properly. So consider this: if we have a super basketball player but he or she is a bit slow thus they have a C and you kick them off the team that seems a bit unfair. Also if the child is an immigrant they might not be able to learn for a while and once thy do learn the time for their sport might be already over. Also what if the child is not a bad kid just that he came back from a vacation and has a lot to catch up to and they have a C then its not very fair.

There are some bad sides to this issue but there is also good reasoning to this. After all why should kids who don't care about school be aloud to join a sports team? The ability to do a sport is a privilege and they should work for it. then again the grades might be perfect but the kids citizenship is horrible that's a different story altogether. I under stand why you did this but I think that you should put this into affect after the season is over so the kids have time to adjust to the change right now it seems like its just out of the blue.

I think that this is a good idea but you shouldn't base it on grades, instead you should base it on citizenship marks. Like I said what if the kid is a bit slow and cant help but get bad grades then what? My idea is to use citizenship marks to define weather or not to let them join sports. If that doesn't suit you then i suggest to first check their background first before you decide any ways I still think that you should put this rule into affect after this trimester so kids can adjust.

"I do not belive that self driven cars are the are a good alternative, or that they would save lifes. They are not able to react to new or unforseen senarios, they would cause people to become comfortable and be unprepared in the case of a problem. People will overall become worse driverse and be more werried and more likely to panick in case of a siguation needing their atention manifesting it self. In adition a car is an item some people hold very closely and injoy driving, these people will likely resist driverless cars, making for an uncomfertable mix of the two. For these reasons it is my beleif that driverless cars are not the future and will in no way benifit society.

The driverless cars produced so far require humans to take over in siduations such as backing in and out of driveways, the visinity around ancidents, and unforseen complications. Right now these cars are only able to handle low speeds around 25 mph, and relly heavely on human intervention. Perhaps the greatest problem is the expence, the equitment is heavy expencive and likely requires constant revisions to the design as knew flaws are revealed, as well as constant repair. To add to that any accidents that do accore will can not be blamed on human error, so any manufactorer would have many additional expenses in court, not to mension how many laws must be changed in order to make any of this posible. Any human driver would have to remain alert at all time to make sore that the car is making no error, but seeing the miles go by any driver would be luld into a fake sence of confort and reliability.

In conclusion, through expences and through the impracticality of the entire concept this is an idea unlikely to make it to the market. People would blame any misshap on the unsentiant driver, and they would be very hard to rebuke which in adition to the manufactoring cost would make this undoable for most manufactering componies do to the cost alone. Laws woud need to change,people would become worse drivers, and would be unprepared for taking over. The most difficult parts of driving would be left for the humans. This idea is intreging but it is as many ideas are, impracticle, and very, very expensive.                  ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Many people give up their lives and time to become a seagoing cowboy. Luke was one of those people who did this. Many people who join this program wanted to help people by not joing the military so they joined this program. These people helped countries with problems after wars. There are lots of reasosns to join the UNRRA program.

Another reason to join the seagoing cowboys is you get to help people while traveling. You get to see so many things that you probably wouldn't have seen if you were not a seagoing cowboy or memeber on UNRRA. Many people did this after World War II ended in Europe. The text states ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins."" and

""In August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. 'We arrived August 14,' Luke says, 'the day the Pacific war ended.'""

Luke and his friend had to go over seas the day a war on the water ended.

Sure there are dangers of being a seagoing cowboy, but many countries and people are helped. People join not just for travel, but to help others. Many countries are helped do to the UNRRA program. Many countries get food, shelter, and clothes taken away to help military during war. The UNRRA helps these people get these things back.

"Do you think students should do community service?

Well i think they should because its to many kids on they street doing things that they don't got business doing an it a same that their like this.

I think that if students do community service it will help the environment plus help the lots orderly residents needing the help in their homes.

An I think that students should take more interest in helping day cares, cleaning up the parks volunteering in helping teachers in elementary schools

If students help the teachers in elementary school the teachers will not have to leave their students unattended with no supervision. They can go make where they need to go an com back. Also at day cares if the sitter need help with entertaining the kids you got someone to do it for you an to keep them quiet, bring a snack when its time to eat, or read a book when its time take a nap. Last if the students clean the parks up for us the kid wont have to worrie about they kids getting hurt or the baby's eating something they don't have no business.

"I disagree that student should have to do a activity after school or club or sports. After school students might can't do after school do to family problems, stressed, or just don't want to do those things. I also disagree because you can't force a person who dosen't want to do something you want them to do for after school.

family problems, a lot of student go through alot when it comes to family and just don't have the time because earthier something tradect happened or someone in there family died and thats hard on student when it comes to a family member dyeing or something bad happens. some students dont also have the time because there parent have to work and the student has to watch its brother or sister and just cant saty after school because of that. Student Can't stay after school because there parents need help around the house after school and sometimes they don't have a ride to get home or they don't have a bus to ride.

After school a lot of student are stressed because of school work, grades and homework. At school you sometimes a lot of classes and you just get really stressed because you can't keep up with the school work. Grades are a big factor at school because without good grades you sometimes can't do the stuff you want to and the grade affects some of your stuff. homework some kids dont have the time to stay after school because they have a lot of homework and sometimes home work affects your after school activities. Stressed is one of the biggest factors of not wanting to do after school.

Some students are not good at a lot of thing like sports, or clubs or they just dont like those things. Student shouldn't be forced to do something that they arent good at. sometimes they don't know what to do or they could get embarrassed in front of the kid that are good at it. They could make fun of those kids and laugh at them because they are not good at it what they were forced too do after school.

Conclusion- students should not have to do what they dont want to do after school because its just not right to force a student to do something they don't want to do after school",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Students across the country wake up and log on to their laptops to tune into the lessons prepared for the day. Now that there has been an explosion of technological use in the world with the role of techology increasing in our lives, many people are starting to consider integrating it with schools to make learning more accessible. While some may argue that it is beneficial to take classes from home because of the convenience, it is in fact more beneficial to go to school because it provides a much needed social space for students and offers powerful motivation

Schools offer a much needed social space for students today. It was easier than ever before to hole up in my room after school; I didn't have a single reason to leave. I had the whole internet at my disposal and I could spend hours browsing the web, playing videogames, or watching shows. Now that students are spending the majority of their time on phones, laptops, computers, and other devices; they are lacking the face to face communication that was so prevalent in earlier times. That last thing students need is more attachment to technology, whether it be educational or not. Schools help counteract this pandemic by forcing students to be together and provide a place for students to make long lasting and valuable friendships.

Schools also allow students to support and motivate each other .

There is a test encroaching upon our class and I am not confident in the subject at hand. After asking one of my classmates a question that I have been pondering, she swiftly answers it and tells me that she has been studying for atleast an hour for the past three days. Most are not born with the motivation to do well in school. Students that are around other motivated people, often become motivated themselves, spreading the successful habits throughout a myriad of people. Motivation is a huge factor in making successful people who they are and school is a vital place where motivation can be instilled.

Some people believe that it would be more beneficial for students if they attended online classes because it provides convenience that school lacks. While it does provide more convenience than commuting to school, this benefit is not outweighed by the cost because there can still be technological issues that delay learning. A student may not be able to connect to the internet in order to attend an online class or there could be a power outage that leaves the technology useless for learning.

School provides an area where not only can you find a great group of friends that you get to see in person, but also people that instill motivation within you, an integral part of any sucessful person. They have been and will continue to be an important institution for educating people around the world. With the rise in use of technology such as cell phones and computers, it is important to keep a balanced schedule between work and life in order to maintain a healthy mind and body.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"community work

I have noticed that some of the streets and ground is full of trash. Trash bags, litter, paper, water bottles, plastic, and other stuff. We should stop the littering and everyone should pitch into clean up our earth so creatures like birds, dear, fish, and other animals can flourish. Also if we keep our community clean it will look allot nicer then people would live in the area just because its clean. So i suggest that everyone in the schools fourth grade and up can go to an after school program to help our community. days like Mondays and Tuesdays would be good, or whenever some one sees trash.

If every school every person cleans up every community, then i promise we will live in a much beautiful place to call home. Here is some tips on how to keep our community's clean, have a large trash bin on every curve of every house, have trash bins in a park, if you see some trash laying around then pick it up and put it in the trash, if you cant find a trash bin then hold it until you find one. Follow these steps to clean the community clean.

Think about this, if every kid in every school cleans up the environment, and if there's 500 kids in each school then that's a whole lot of people helping the community. Imagine all these kids out helping to clean the environment, the streets, parks, community's free of all garbage, wouldn't that be awesome! Not only the schools but if we inspire other people like in churches, think of some of the youth groups that can help to. OTHER_NAME already has something like community work.

If every person picks up garbage and follows these rules 1 at a time then trust me, our homes parks nature everything would be allot more pleasant. And it would be amazing if all the people helped to keep community's clean. Wouldn't you agree more?",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Mr. State Senator,

I am writing this lettter to talk about how the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. First, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Second, there could be a tie in the electoral vote. Last, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electors rather than the president. Those are my points on why to take away the Electoral College.

To start this off the Electoral College is unfair to the voters. Because of the ""winner-take-all system in each state"", the candidates don't take time to go to other states that they know they will lose, they only really focus on the ""swing"" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen statesdidn't see the candidates in their state at all, also 25 of the largest media markets had not seen a single campaign ad from a candidate. Also it's unfair because voters don't really know who to vote for because they see no campaign ads and candidates don't show up to their state and tell them what he/she is running for. That's why the Electoral College is unfair to voters of the presidential election.

Second, there could be a tie in the electoral vote. In the case of the tie it would go straight to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote for the president. By this the House's decision is no where close to that of the people in their state. The election is omly a few swing voters away from catastrophe. That's why it is bad if the vote ends in a tie.

Lastly, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electors rather than the president. For instance, if you ""lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" The worst part is that the electors could be anyone you don't even have to hold a political position to be an elector, they could be very biased and narrowminded. That's why the Electoral College is unfair.

In conclusion Mr. Senator the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational because it is unfair to voters, there could be a tie in the electoral vote and the voters are merely voting for a slate of electors and not there president. So Mr. Senator I would like for you to take this into concideration and Abolish the Electoral College!                                                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Presidential elections provides the United States of America with an opprotunity of unification. The process of choosing the next leader of the United States always brings the people of the country together knowing that all of them play a role in the election. This is present in the popular vote, a vote consisting of the general population. However, the popular vote is not always accurate, as anyone of any background can vote as long as they hold proper citzenship. The electoral college on the other hand, is a process that serves as a compromise between Congress and the rest of America. The fact of the matter is, the electoral college is beneficial to the presidential election because it unifies Congress and the people of America, and is part of the country's roots.

To begin with, the electoral college, more than anything, unifies the people. The electors were once, as everyone in the nation is, an average citizen. According to Bradford Plumer the electors chosen, ""...depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" On top of that Bradford indentifies the electors as, ""...anyone not holding a public office."". Bradford Plumer illustrates better than anyone that the electors chosen are average citizens who think the same as the rest of the general population while still keeping in mind that Congress must also be represented. Knowing this, the working-class people of America, and Congress can rest easy knowing that the electoral college process will make the decision that is best for the nation as a whole. This decision making, whether directly or indirectly, unifies the country. In 2012 more than three-fourths of the nation tuned in to watch the presidential election; in the end being one of the most watched televised elections in the country's history. This number includes Congressmen. This shows that the decision making process of the electoral college brings all the people of the nation together to decide on the choosing of the coutries next leader.

The general population, though average citizens, are somtimes not as qualified as Congress to make unbiased, beneficial decisions on behalf of the rest of the country. However, knowing that the next President could be a part of Congress, sometimes sways the decision in favor of a particular candidate. In this paradox of the qualification of Congress and the average citizen, the electoral college is used to fill the void. The electoral college has been used since the founding of the country. The founding fathers of America (George Washington, Ben Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, etc.)must have developed the electoral college process for some reason. According to the Office of the Federal Register, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" More than anything the electoral college is a mutual and nuetral process that represents something inbetween the biased politics of Congress and the average citizen. The average working class person is the greatest example of American integrity. This person shows that in this great nation, if you set a goal and are willing to work to acheive that goal, it can be acheived. Why strip this moral that has represented the United States of America since its first years?

While there have been a few flaws in the electoral college throughout history, this decision making process still unifies the people of America and is still, most importantly, part of its roots. More than anything, the electoral college process represents the two sides of the country: Congress and the average working class citizen. So, rest easy knowing that the next election, there is a process between Congress and average working citizens that works to make the decision that is best for the people of this great nation, the United States of America.            ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear State Senator,

After conducting studies on the American voting system ,I noticed many flaws. Deciding on presidency is one of the most vital processes in any countrie,so it should be addresed properly. the fact that voters vote not for president ,but they vote for slate of electors,the electors can be anyone not holding public office,and the fact that 17 states were never visited during 2000 only focusing on swing states  are just some facts we must look at when deciding a nations fate.

The fact that voters dont vote for president ,but they are actually voting for electors is should be looked into because the people are not  voting for president .The are voting for people to vote for president .which throughly explains the idea that the majority oppinion of the nation is invaluable to the goverment and our society  .This system is not fair .Nor is this system equal. and nor should this system continue to destroy our beloved countrie .

The electors can be anyone not holding public office .This is one of the most gruesome facts about this topic .Bestowing any dreg of society the honor of being an elector is NOT a good idea .This means when one of us votes for an elector trusting him with the fate of the nation. He could mislead us and vote for any canidate making the whole voting system corrupt and misleading.

17 states were unvisited by canidates in 2000. which leads U.S citezens  to ask questions like:Is our oppinion valuable or even considerd valid ? Do the leaders want to run for the benefit of this countrie or do they want POWER?Do our votes even matter or make a diffrence ?Should we just give up on the corrupt system we must live under today?

Thinking about the subject from the prepective of our founding fathers .They would NEVER want a voting system like ours today were people's oppinions dont matter,With often and misleading corrupt electors  not letting the majority rule .This system should be put to an end ,So our countrie can live free again.                                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear senator

I think you should keep the electoral colleges. The elctoral colleges are not a vote for presidency but its the vote for slate of electors who in turn elect the president. This is a great way to find a good president because if the people voted they might not know much about the president that they are voting for but if the slate of electers are the ones who pick the president they might know what the man running for president is not telling us. If their is a tie in the electoral votes than the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state deligates vote on the president. The electoral college should stay.

The electoral colleges has been an american tradition for hundred of years why would you end such a long and strong condition. The only bad thing about the electoral colleges in my opinion is that it is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. ( According to the article the electoral college: why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong) ""during the 200 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including road island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad."" Bobe dole thinks they should abolish the electoral college he thinks its unfair, outdated, and irrational.

It is the electers who vote for presiden not the people it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the nations popular vote. It happened in 200 when gore had more popular votes than bush but bush had more electoral votes and bush still won the race and became president. You should keep the electoral college throughout history it has helped us in many ways. Lots of people say you should abolish it but give it a few more years and see what happens. The electoral college also stops run off electios this means no candidate recieves a majority of the vote cast. If their is a run off election the people might think the election was rigged or unfair. So please leave the electoral college alone it benefits us in a lot of ways.

"Dear Principal,

Changing the policy to having a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities is unfair. Many students may not be able to make a B average.

Sports and other activities give many students only a little time left to finish their homework and to study for test. If the policy changes then students will have to cram everything and have no time for anything else. Their lives would consist of only the sport and schoolwork. This would be highly bad for their health and could possibly make them feel angry and frustrated.

Another reason is that changing the policy could make a lot of people not be able to participate which will also hurt the team or group. If an important player could not make the game just because of getting something under a B average it would hurt the team and the outcome of the game. No school wants to lose every game.

A grade B average would also be to close of a call. If someone got a 79.4 that would average to a 79 which is only one point away. If someone was that close it would be unfair to him or her. A grade C average is reasonable because a C is technically passing, and it would allow students a better chance. Changing to a B average is to high of standards for someone who is so busy.

Also some people are just bad at schoolwork and can only manage a barely passing grade. Those people should not be excluded from anything just because they are not able to process information as well as some others.

Extra activities and sports are an important part in many students lives. It keeps students active and allows them to socialize with friends. If they were not allowed to participate because of a passing average (above 70) it could be devastating to them. For many people, they rely on sports to get them to college, and to get scholarships.

For some people sports help them lose their frustration and relax. Kind of like a cruise to get away from the world and to just concentrate on having fun.

Even though having good grades are important so is having fun and getting active. Changing the policy to a grade B average to be allowed to participate in sports of other activities is a horrible idea. Active activities should be encouraged not took away.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

While i can tell what you are saying, I think that to have a B average to participate in sports is very unreasonable. As you may know an B in a very nice grade to achieve and maintain, but also it may be that most of the student body that participates in sport related activity's cannot achieve such goals. It may be just out of their reach or along ways away, but no matter, they should have the right to play sports just as they have the right to pass with a D average.

Most student who may be having troubles with there school work may not understand or be able to comprehend the material given to them. This is not completely their fault. The teachers should give a better explanation of the material to the students who are troubled.

Don't you think that the students with a C average are already stressed out enough? With all of the extra work they would have to do just to get the B that they need to participate in sports, they would most likely have the sleep they need deprived from them as they would need more time after the strenuous amount of homework given to study for up coming test and quiz's that they need to ace.

So I hope that you consider what I have said, as to prevent all the depravity in the already stressed out teen life.

"The Electoral College is a ""process"" ""between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (1). The Electoral Collage was created by the founding fathers and was written in the Constitution. The Electoral Collage should be kept instead of popular vote because the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who becomes President and it is chosen by a better educated person.

To start, the Electoral Collage helps in deciding who is gonna be the President.  ""Certainity of outcome, everyones President, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections"" (Posner). The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (18). ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (19). ""...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"" (20). ""So, other things being equal , a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" (21). ""The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (22).

Secondly, when voting for Electoral Collage ""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" (6). ""Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors"" (5). ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" (5).

Although the Electoral Collage sounds simple, there are some problems that occur. ""...According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage-- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (9). ""Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (10).

To conclude, the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who is becomes the President and it is chosen by a better educated person. ""Voters in a presidental elections are people who want to express a politcal preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election..."" (23).    ",0,persuade_corpus,0

One reason why online classes are beneficial is that if the student does go to school and if he/she is sick that day he/she can take an online class that will teach him the material and doesn't have to worry about making up the work he missed or being behind other students because he/she caught up with the material that they learned that day.

If the new computer software that can tells people emotions, sciencetists should make them more valuable like adding more news features to it and that will make more people to like them.            ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Should summer projects be teacher or student designed? Doing projects over the summer are great for memory. Are also fun to do because it is a hands on activity to do over the summer. Learning and understanding are reasons on why teacher-designs are great fro summer projects.

One reason, on why teacher-designs are great for summer projects is learning. Learning from the teacher's design over the summer is best because going into a new school year will help when going over the topic. Another example, on why learning from the teacher's design over the summer is perfect fro what the teacher wants you to talk about over summer break. Their is another reason on why a teachers design is better.

Another reason, on why teacher-designs are great for summer projects is understanding it. Understanding the teacher's example is perfect for making your own. The reason why the teacher's give out an example is to understand the layout of what they want you to do. Some people would argue over why a students design is better.

Some people would say that, doing a student- designed project over the summer is better because it's easier to understand. The teacher's design is better than the student design because it gives a layout on what the student needs to do and put on their project.

In conclusion, learning and understanding are reasons why teacher's give out their own design for students over the summer. If I had a project over the summer I would use the teachers- design to help me out.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think the idea of students performing community service is a grate idea. In fact I'd love to help with that and take time out of my life to help with this. It may seem silly, but to me the environment is really important to me. It's where i can have my fun and skate and hang out with friends. If nobody did such a task, the world would look like one huge trash can, garbage can, dump, Etc.

To help with this important matter when we're done with our trash, we should put it in the right despoils can so that it is actually thrown away properly.

But this all should be an option. Nobody should have to do this if they want. Let them go play have fun while other kids work their butts off to make our planet a better place. When they see how their world is being treated, they'll do anything to help 'cause I know for a fact they won't want there ""playground"" to be all dirty.

Let's just say you required community service. Do you actually know how many people would do that like for real? Maybe about 9% of the school. Some kids are always complain about everything. Hey, I'm one of those kids too. But there's always times when I know I HAVE to be serious. And when it's something like this, I'm totally serious.

To me I would back up you [TEACHER_NAME] for community service. I want to see who actually cares about our planet.

Thank you for your time.

Yours truly,

"The Electoral College is a process in which electors pick the president instead of the people, but is it worth keeping. No, the Electoral College is not worth keeping because it reflects the view of the electors instead of  the people.

Some people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certaintity of the outcome ( source 3 paragoh 18). However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win (source 3 paragraph 19). This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the canditate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory. In all the Electoral College should be abolished becasue it takes away say of the people.

Not only does the Electoral college take away the say of the people, it also has no protection against a tie of states that have an even number of electors (source 2 paragraph 11). For instance a state like hawaii that has a total of two electors if they both vote for differnt people then how are the votes decided well it already happened in 1960,but Richard Nixon who was the vice president at the time and known to be against the Electoral College decided to only aknowledge his opponents electors. That is why we should abolish the Electoral College.

Allow me ask a hypothetical question what if the electors were corrupt and voted for whomever they pleased without even considring the peoples vote (source 1 paragrqaph 2). We have no system to ensure that the people vote matters but the electors does therefore electors that are picked by former canditates may be more likely to return the favor and ignore the peoples vote and vote for their canditate. There are many important figures whom are against the Electoral College such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter,  and Bob Dale there are many more but thes are all politicians who see the Electoral College the same way the people do (source 2 paragraph).

In all the Electoral college should be abolished because it ignores the peoples votes. The votes that werre granted to the people by the constitution therefore the Electoral College not only doesn't care about the people, but it is also violating their constitutional rights.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hi my name is Luke. When I was 17 my friend Don asked me to be a

""Seagoing Cowboy"". I said yes beacuse it was a ""once in a life time opportunity"". When I first became a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" the year was 1945.

When I turned 18 I had enlisted in the army. On the ship we had to work hard day and night, we had to care for the animals during the crossings, We had to lift the heavy bags of oats and hay. We also had to water the animals two or three times a day. It was hard but it was helpful to me. When I was discharged in 1947 I had made 9 trips that is more then anyone else. But I had some good times on the ship as a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". After we would drop all of the animals off where they were needed we would play game in their stals like, Base Ball, Volleyball,Table-Tennis,Boxing,fencing,and Whittling.

But in the end all of that hard work and time was worth it. I was able to go to so many places!

I went to

Greece to see the Acropolis. I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I took a ride in a gondola in Venice, Itally, with streets of water. I also toured in a excavated castle in Crete and marveld at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

"Imagine being a student on summer break and still letting your teacher decide what project you are doing, would you want that? While some may say that teacher designed projects over the summer time are better, I disagree with that statement. Letting students make their own projects for summer lets them have more creativeness, it makes the project easier on them, and could lets them enjoy their projects a lot more since they dont have to follow some guidelines. I know I would want to have a student designed project especially since its summer time. When students get their own student designed project it lets them have more creativeness, easier projects, and lets them have more fun with their project.

When a student gets to design his or her own project it lets them be creative which will lead to a better project. Creativeness leads to great things, something that is emphasized by almost every teacher. In addition, a student project that is designed by them is the science fair and some amazing projects come out of that every year. When you are stuck following guidelines their is not much to do with your project, when I had to make my own project I got an A+ on it. Creativeness leads to overall better projects, which teachers will like more.

Students making there own project lets them have an easier time with the project. They know the own guidelines and rules since they designed the project. I know when I was in this situation I benefited a lot from letting me make my own guidelines to follow make the project easier for me to do. When the project is easier that gives me more motivation to do it, so all my time spent on the project is productive. Students benefit a lot when they are doing something that comes easy to them.

While making your own project it lets you enjoy your time working on the project. Working on a project where you are having fun and enjoying yourself is a much better experience than just slugging it out. Their is a saying that ""time flies when you're having fun,"" that could apply to the project too. When Im having fun it leads to better results and a less amount of work time. Also, why would a teacher not want you to have fun while you're on summer break.

Some could argue that teacher designed projects are better due to them being more structured and proper. Student designed projects are still the better option, when a student is creative it leads to an overall better project. They also have an easier time with the project, which leads to more motivation to do the project and get it over with. Also , actually enjoying the project leads to an overall better and less amount of work time. Student designed projects are the way to go because, it lets them be creative, makes the project easier, and lets them enjoy their time working on the project.         ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Mr. Principal

The idea of making school policy that you have to have at least a grade average of a B is a good idea, but you would have more of your star players ineligible to play because of grades. Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes i would encourage this but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all of the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possible shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it and those who don't fear us in an athletic category. I believe though if you must make this a rule, then you have to get the ones who aren't as smart tutors or someone to help them get the grades to play their sport. For other activities the I can see where having an eligibility grade of at least a B could be a good thing like ski club, that's something that you can do by yourself bu the school provid

In conclusion I believe that it could be a good idea if our school was known for its grades but because it's just the opposite, we need to keep the eligibility level at a C average to maintain our reputation to those outside of school and those who may be thinking of coming to our school.

"Driverless cars may seem like a cool new innovation that take the stress away from driving. The truth is that while there are many positive things about driverless cars there are still many complications with introducing them into society. Without a driver, the mechanics could malfunction and cause a safetly threat to other drivers and pedestrians. Many states also have laws against even testing driverless cars. Even thought the car can do the basic driving by itself, the human passangers still need to take control for more complicated road conditions. The production and use of driverless cars is negative to society because they pose a safety threat, force laws to change, and they still require human control.

Saftey is always a concern when dealing with any type of motor vehicle and driverless cars increase the risk of safety because they do not have human control. Every state has road laws that every driver is meant to follow. Traffic laws assume that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence states how the laws believe that a car is only safe when there is a human controlling it. These laws are meant to promote safety and since they state a human needs to be in control for a vehicle to be safe, then driverless cars are not the best thing for safety. This is negative because when there is a larger safety risk, more people may be fatally injured and the general public will feel unsafe. the use of driverless cars on the road would require the laws to be modified and allow their use.

Another way that driverless cars are negative to society is that they would force the laws to change to accommadate them. All over the country there are laws in place that prohibit the use of driverless cars. According the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"". Since driveress cars are illegal in most states, in order for them to be used on the roads all of the laws relevant to this topic would need to be changed or adjusted. Changing the laws is negative because changing the already safe laws could cause the general public to be unsafe and the process for changing the laws is a hastle. It needs to be sent in and approved by many government branches and could be rejected by any one, causing the process to repeat. Not only is it a hastle and burden, it is also takes a lot of time. Even if the laws are changed the cars still require human involvement

Driverless cars may seem more convenient but in reality they require human interaction in any tough traffic situation. As a result this is negative because it is not improving the convenience for drivers. Some say that driverless cars are more convenient, but in fact they can only perform the easy aspects of driving without the aid from the human driver. Driverless cars ""can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires human skills""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence shows how involved humans have to be in a ""driverless"" car. An invention that seems convenient actually requires the driver to be more alert so they know when they need to step in to control the car in difficult situations. This is negative because waiting for difficult road conditions can cause a driver to be more stressed and anxious than they would be if they were normally driving a car. Since the driver needs to more alert and the fact that driverless cars are not that convenient at all there is no reason for them to be on the roads.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be produced and driven on the roads becasue they pose a saftely threat to the general public, they require the laws to change and they still need human interaction and therefore are not a convenience. Considering this, is it really worth all the risk and hastle just for something ""cool"" to be on the road? Would it still be cool if these vehicles endangered you or a family member?

"Planing. Can the tecnologic read face of the emocion of human. Scientit are makeing computer to keeping growing u. The most comun expression is the paint of Mona Lisa Smile. This paint can be express the emotion of happy, sadness and same more. The computer can read your face with your own muscle.

""Dr. Huang and his collenge are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate"". The main computer are growing up to be able accepting human. In the past nobody know the real face of tecnologic. The scientits are proving evidents the human can comunite witha none human. In other way the expression to seem a emotion through a computer is complice to understand, but the reason to develop the tectologic is to understand the human.

""She'83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

The way to decribe the same way. The happyness of the paint can tranfer us. She is happy but the same way to be happy is afear to do a mistake . The computer are showing work to be able to do it. The paint is the best work of Leonedo because is showing the real face of the human.

""Yet Dr. Huang OBserves that artists such as da Vinci studies human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to covery specific emotions.""That way to identifies a reason to able read your face is the muscle.

"Is this technology that is able to read students' emotional expressions valuable?

I think the value of using this technology to read the students' emotions is really important. It is important because you can determain if students show some sort of depression in there life and you can be able to help them prevent suicide. "" A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would help the teacher be able to help students out or try to teach them in a different way so it doesn't seem so bored or confusing.

This new technology can help in so many different ways. Us oursleves may or may not see how another person is feeling, we might think they are feeling happy but deep inside they can be sad.

"Well first off Dr. Paul Eckman created a sytem called FACS, which creates affects and changes on human facial expressions for better results. This allows a new form of technology to change emotions and more. This software can identify emotions just like that!.

In my opinion I think that there is no need for this system to identify facials expressions on students. Because first we are young so you know when we are angry, happy, or sad because we tend to show it. Like body language older people and even people my age know when there is something wrong with one another, because you can tell how they usally are from how they are at that moment. Don't get me wrong i like what Dr. Paul came up with this type of science and technology, but i dont think it's neccessary to change pictures and add emotions to something.

I just think using this technology on these students wouldn't do much, but tell you whether or not there sad, angry, happy, confused, excited, and etc. However this technology shounldn't go to waste I mean you can use this technology in other ways like animlas, you can't really tell whether an animal is happy, sad,and etc.

But so far I like the whole idea just not the type of experiment Dr. Paul is trying to accomplish. His technology that he has created is outstanding , and im pretty shore he can find something else to use it for. So like I said you don't need a comeputer to read a humans face or body langauge.                     ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Students from all around the world attend schools in various locations, under different stress levels, and with an array of goals pertaining to each student. We live in a technology dependent society. From cellphones to laptops, we hold our lives and personal history on these devices, therefore, considering how helpful it would be, computerized schooling should also be offered on these devices. When attending an online course all of these details are wiped clean, simply a name with a passing or failing score besides a computer generated ID, for some this could be considered unnatural, unhelpful, and in broad terms wrong. I disagree with these notions because online schooling is extremely beneficial for the same reasons some may consider it harmful. Online classes are beneficial to students because they directly cater to a students schedule, they are helpful to students in terms of distance, and they offer another option to students who may experience mental and physical health issues as well as bullying.

Job's, career's, and responsibility's, all things that students may have to take into consideration when attending traditional schooling due to their schedules, when given the option to choose between a traditional or a modern solution, the majority would choose a more modern option for a more custom fit. Students would be given a due date on their assignments and a lesson plan on the material, leaving them free to decide when to complete these tasks. A very close friend of mine happened to be in this exact scenario due to his soccer career. Once he had informed me that he made the switch to online school, I could see a different version of him, he was truly a stress free individual when it came to his education because he could attend his classes through a screen. Some may say this would cause a student to ""slack off"", but that's incorrect. Regardless of online or traditional schooling, the choice to attend is solely based on the student and their goals; having it be online or through video, has no effect on this. My friend chose online school for various reasons, another reason for his decision was the distance between him and his school because of his travel.

Distance, it's a large issue for the majority of our population whether it be work or relationships, although not many consider it, the distance issue also applies to schooling. Students live in all types of conditions all around the world, making it difficult to reach a traditional school at sunrise, only to make their ""voyage"" back eight hours later. This could also be because of travel due to careers, an issue my friend struggled with. Online schooling is an easy solution to both of theses issues and is very similar to homeschooling in this event. Students can reach their goals directed at their education without having to struggle through finding a way to attend classes. It could be argued that a bus would be available to pick up students and take them home once school is over, but for some, a bus is a luxury that they don't have. This could be due to the distance between the school and the student in which some distances buses cannot travel. It could be argued that parents or students may drive to their school's location but a full tank of gasoline and personal use vehicles are not widely offered within families. Along with distance issues, mental health issues, medical conditions, and bullying can also add to a students list of reasons as to why online school is beneficial.

In a world in which mental health is taboo and medical conditions along with bullying are downplayed, an online education is an easy solution to these problems. It has been said that around 47% of students struggle with conditions such as depression, anxiety, social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder or a physical disability. All of these conditions make attending school a grueling activity for most. Whereas an online education defeats all of these scenarios. Whether it be a hospital bed, a therapist's office, or even your own kitchen, online school is widely available to all whom are living a double life. Bullying rates for teens and children only seem to be going up, this negatively impacts a student so greatly, that they may feel like school isn't something they could handle on a day to day basis. Some may say that mental health and physical disabilities as well as bullying can be handled in a school environment by counselors and special exceptions that may be offered but this is simply false due to the fact that most school counselors aren't trained in helping students deal with a debilitating disease making an online education a better fit for most students dealing with these problems. By having an education packed into a computer screen, students are then encouraged to take their lives into their own hands, taking all power away from any illness or bully.

Online school is an amazing option for all and should be treated as one. Students who accept this route are encouraged to be responsible and healthy, which are the most important things in ones life. Online school should be a choice given to all because of its various benefits. Online educations are extremely beneficial in cases of scheduling, distance from a traditional schooling location, and student illnesses or bullying. Education is something that our young population should be offered regardless of a predisposed disability, online school makes getting an education a level playing field for all. It is convenient and overall a marvelous opportunity and should be widely available for our student population. ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Dear Principal,

Allowing students to have cell phones at school could provide an unproductive learning environment. If students are allowed to have cell phones, they could take advantage of it and use them as distractions. Also, they could get stolen or broken and then provide a lot of trouble for the school. Therefore, I believe that the school should adopt a no cell phone policy.

If students were given the ability to have cell phones at school, they would then take them and use them during class as well. For instance, they might use it to text their friends or cheat on a test. This would provide a distraction from their learning that could cause them to suffer in the future. Also, many new cell phones have calculators on them which could in turn be used on a math test or quiz as an act of academic dishonesty. As a result the ability to carry cell phones at school would prove to be an unwise decision.

In a case in which a cell phone were stolen or broken, it could provide a problem for the student as well as the school. If you brought a cell phone to school and it was stolen for some reason, it would cause a huge disruption. For example, the student's parents would probably be unhappy and then go and talk to the school about it. This would then cause a problem for the school and the person who stole the cell phone. Therefore, in the case of this event it would be easier just to leave the cell phone at home.

Lastly, a cell phone could be used to discompose others. For example, if a person did not have a cell phone, someone else might then have reason to aggravate them or put them down. This could then cause a drop in their self esteem and prove to be very hurtful. In a similar scenario, a student might use a cell phone to upset someone else by texting or spreading rumors about others. As a result, not being able to have cell phones at school could prevent events such as this, and provide a more supportive and encouraging environment.

Although some may argue that they need cell phones to contact their parents in the event of an emergency, the school would be able to provide a phone in the office that would be open to all students. Therefore, there is no case in which a cell phone would be crucial to have. Because of the distraction and complications that cell phones could cause, they should not be allowed on the school campus.

"Every year teachers across the United States of America assign summer projects to their students. These summer projects push students to continue learning new information over the summer.

Although some people may believe that a teacher should design these projects because a teacher will create a meaningful project that will benefit the students, the students should design their own project because they will pick a topic that interests them, they will be motivated to complete the project, and they will use their creativity and imagination to design something wonderful and exciting.

First of all, students who design their own summer project, will most likely design something that interests and excites them. For example, a student named Generic_Name was interested in earth science and decided to create a summer project where he found and labeled different types of rocks.

This project interested Generic_Name and pushed him to explore and learn about what he loves.

If a teacher had assigned a project to Generic_Name where he wrote a paper about inflation in the U.S. this project most likely would not have interested or excited Generic_Name. Another time, a different student named Generic_Name had the opportunity to design his own summer project, he chose to examine and record the life cycle of frogs and monitor their growth.

Generic_Name was immensely interested in biology and was thrilled to have the opportunity to create a project were he was interested and expanding his knowledge about the subject of biology. Students creating their own summer projects are more likely to choose a project that interests and excites them than if a teacher assigned a project.

Furthermore, another advantage to a student creating their own project is that the student will be motivated to complete the project. Students all over the country struggle to complete school work because they lack motivation.

If a student created his or her own project, they could create something fun that he or she would be motivated to put effort into and complete. A student could be assigned a project by a teacher about the Pythagorean theorem, but he would be so unmotivated to complete the project or learn any new information from the project. This defeats the whole purpose of a summer project, which is for students to continue to learn and expand their knowledge over summer break. If this same student was given the option to create his own project, he could design a project where he builds a miniature and rocket and launches it.

This student would be motivated to complete the exciting project that he designed, but more importantly the student would be learning new information while he completed the project.

Another example is when a student named Generic_Name decided to do a summer project where he studied different types of trees. Generic_Name loved being outside, so this project motivated him to look for different types of trees in nature and complete the project.

Generic_Name learned an enormous amount of information about trees while he was completing his project, but he also had an immense amount of fun.

When a student determines their own summer project they are given the option to pick something fun that motivates them to complete the project while learning new information.

Last of all, letting a student design their own project will activate the students creativity. In today's age students are not given enough opportunities to use their imagination and creativity. This is why students should be allowed to create their own project. The process of designing the project allows the students to use their creativity. For example if a student was given a boring project to complete over the summer by a teacher they would not be using their imagination or their creativity. This is not the way a summer project should be, a summer project should trigger the students imagination and excite them with possibilities. For example a young student in sixth grade created a project where she wrote a paper about what she wants to be when she becomes an adult.

This sixth grader used her imagination to write about herself in the future.

A teacher would not necessarily assign a project that allowed students to use their imagination. Creativity and imagination are both extremely important, this is why students should be the ones to design their projects to complete over summer break.

In conclusion, designing summer projects should be left up to the students, because the students will be more motivated to complete the project, interested by their topic, and forced to use their creativity. In the near future more and more teachers across the United States will let their students design their own summer projects.

All teachers should let their students be motivated, creative, and interested in what they are learning, this is why students should create their own summer projects.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I agree with this decision. It is important for students to do these activities so they can learn more about the things they like to do. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can become more social and do better in school.

Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can become more social. Participating in clubs or sports will help students make new friends. If you are on a sports team and you dont know anybody, then you should make friends with them to help improve your teamwork. joining clubs or sports will also encourage students to go out more. This can relate to making new friends. If students have friends, then they might want to go and hangout more, and maybe even make more new friends. Students may also want to try new things. If students are doing something they enjoy, they might want to find other activities or clubs similar to the first one.

Students should also participate in extracurricular activities because it will help them do better in school. Extracurricular activities will help improve grades. If you are on a sports team, there might be a certain grade or GPA you have to keep. If you dont have a high enough grade, then you will be encouraged to do better and get your grades up. They will also improve relationships with teachers. If you are in a club that is run by a teacher you already have, then you will want to show them that you are a good student, even outside of class. You might even be able to ask for extra help. Students will also have more help with their work. This also relates to making new friends. If you are doing an assignment and you need help, then the people in your sport or club might be able to help you. Some of them might even have classes with you.

Students should be required to take an extracurricular activity because it will improve there social and help them maintain grades. There are lots of clubs and sports to choose from, so students have lots of options. I am in a club and it has helped me make new friends.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principle,

I don't think that you should require every student to do community service.

I think this because everybody should be able to do what they want.

They could volunteer to do it, but you shouldn't make them do it.

It would be a good idea to start a little club or something of that sort to do community service.

Or you could put up a list in the office or right outside of the office for people to participate in doing community service.

I don't think everybody should have to do it cause when they are not in school some have things to do like sports and other sorts of clubs.

You could also get a class that people could be in to do community service as a class so people could put on job applications and college applications too.

A class would also be good for tutoring the elementary, so they wouldn't have to stay after school.

Most student probably wouldn't be able to do that.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Extracurricular Activities

At dismissal time, my principle made an announcement saying that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Do you agree with this decision?

Well, I don't agree with this decision and here are my three reasons why.

My first reason is that extracurricular activities would affect our sleep time.

Although it can keep students busy and organized, students would have less time to sleep.

For example, my friend Generic_Name stays after school for a sport, and he also babysits his little brother, he comes to school tired everyday, but if he didn't do the extracurricular activity and had more sleep time, he would not be tired everyday.

Because students don't get enough sleep, some students come to school late.

Over seventy percent of students fall asleep in school, thirty percent of students come to school late, and forty percent of the students that fall asleep in class participate in extracurricular activities.

My second reason is that you would have less time for homework.

For example, I played basketball.

It was Thursday night right after my game and I had a quiz the following day.

The homework was for me to study over my notes for my quiz tomorrow, but by the the time I got home, it was time for me to go to bed.

The next day arrived and I took the test...and failed it, If i would have not played basketball, I would have had time to study, and I most likely would've passed my test.

My third and final reason is you would have less time to spend with family and friends.

They are most important, family and friends don't mean anything unless you spend time with them.

One day I wanted to stay after school for basketball, but I also wanted to go to my niece first birthday party.

It was a hard choice, but I had to stay back for basketball.

Only if I did not participate in any extracurricular activities, I could have been at my niece first birthday party and supported her.

In conclusion, all students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities.

It causes less time with family and friends, sleep time, and lees time for homework.

"i thnk students will not benefit from attending classes at home because its not the same as studying with a teacher, at school. if i was in this position i know for sure that i wouldnt be paying attention and be distracted all day because i go out with friends and family. at the same time if i were to take the classes at home, it would benefit me by being home with family, be able to go to work early, and actually participate because it would allow me to be on my own, alone and i like to be alone. Another benefit of attending school at home is that you will not have to drive, get stuck in traffic, and will be able to save money. If i were to take classes at home my mom will be on me about school because she really wants me passing and not failing. One thing i wouldn't like, would be working on my own because at times i do like to work on my own but mostly, i would like doing partner work with a friend. A goood thing about classes at home would be that you would be on your own schedule not like at school, you can sleep in more then wake up and start some classes, or you can do classes at a later time.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Although, participating in a extracurricular activity like sports,yearbook, and student council, it may not be the best for everyone. Some kids prefer not to play for a basketball,soccer, or volleyball team, It's not one of their comfort zones or something that they enjoy. Everyone has thier personal opinios,and people shold be recpect that. You can't force someone to do something if they don't want to do it, they would not be enjoying their time. Kids should be doing something fun,something they can enjoy, and something they can look back on as a good memory. Thats a big part of being a part of a club or team. Therefore, I disagree with the decison that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Asthma, Asthma is a shortness of breathe or someone having trouble breathing. People with

Asthma may not be capable or comfortable playing a sport where it involves intense running or a lot of movement. Some people don't acknowledge how hard it is to be playing becasue they dont have

Asthma, and don't know the struggles of it. They would be able to play but it would be involving a risk, anything could happen. For example if someone chose to play soccer, and the coach is making them run 10 laps, they can faint or just fall on the floor due to shortness of breathe. Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

Yearbook , some people can define or express it to be as a fun,exciting, and an adventures thing to do.

Yearbooks are full of happy memorys thorughout the school year, all put into one little book. It also has pictures of teachers and students, so you can see your friends,teachers,and staff members. Sadly, not all people enjoy it, they think its boring, annoying, and a waste of time. People who like it will be putting amazing effort into it to come out beautifly, and people who dont care, their work is going to be sloppy because, they didn't put any effort into it. Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does.

When students are serving as a student council ,

they will be taking advantage of it. Most students are very immature and should not be trusted with a serious job. What I mean by immature is that they would be goofing around a lot, not focus, and would be taking it as a joke. In order to do the job right they should be needed to find someone more mature, someone that they can trust, and someone who will do the job right and someone who will take it seriously. If someone dosen't have a choice to do it, and that's their only option they wont be doing a good job. It's better to get someone who can take the job seriously,and not fool around.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principals final decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because,

Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

People who like doing yearbook will be putting amazing effort into it to come out beautifly, and people who dont care, their work is going to be sloppy because, they didn't put any effort into it. Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does. When students are serving as a student council, they will be taking advantage of it.

"Introducing driverless cars to today's society would be a very big step in technology. Though it would be a big step, it would not be a step in the right direction.

They have yet to create a car that can fully operate on its own. there are too many sensors needed in order to safely use a driverless car, such as video cameras mounted near the rearview mirror, automotive radar sensors, and a dubbed LIDAR. With all of the sensors needed, one could stop working while the car is in motion putting the passenger in danger.

Conflicts between the users of the driverless cars and the manufaturers would be in presence often. The user of the car may often find problems that he or she cannot fix themselves and would have to spend a lot more money to take it in to get fixed. The users might also come to a stituation where the car is in condition to where it cannot get fixed and then have to buy a new car, causing thaty person to spend more money.

"When facing a difficult decision, it is important to get many different opinions on the subject. What sports teams to try out for, what classes to take, and where to go to college are all big decisions in a person's life. Getting multiple peoples' responses will help with decision making by seeing the issue from other viewpoints, avoiding mistakes that have already been made, and reaching the most unbiased consensus.

To one person, a choice can sometimes seem only black and white, however getting advice from others can change this. Each person who is asked will have different experiences and biases affecting the advice they will give. People also play different roles in society, and those roles yield other viewpoints that would not have otherwise been considered. Discussing decisions with peers will bring more sides to an issue, and, in turn, help the person make a more informed choice.

Along with adding viewpoints, avoiding mistakes that have already been made will be achieved by talking with others. Some may have faced similar problems and can share the positives and negatives of each side. Along with this, personal experiences may show one decision will have many other consequences that were not previously taken into account. After reaching a final decision, the choice made will have less unpredicted side effects and it will avoid bad decisions that have been made by others in the past.

As well as seeing topics from other sides and avoiding similar mistakes, discussing choices with friends will produce the least biased decision. Each person asked will have a different opinion and bias on a subject based on prior events. If only one person is consulted, their bias may have a larger effect on the outcome, but something that happened to that person may not apply to that situation. The more people that are asked, the more clear it will be on which outcomes are common, and should be most avoided.

Choices can affect people for a long time and in order to make sure the best decision is being made, it is necessary talk with other people. Getting new advice will add different viewpoints, help avoid similar mistakes that have been made in the past, and bring people to a less biased agreement. Seeking many opinions can help someone make the best choice for them.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Have you ever got made to play a sport or work on a year book and you were tired and didnt feel like doing anything your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity for example students could participate in sports or work on the year book.

I agree because your gonna have to make students do something if there not gonna do it or they choose not to do any extracurricular activity i agree that you should cause you could always try something new so u dont do the same thing over and over again.

Like if someone is tired in the mornings and they dont wanna do anything your gonna have to tell them that they are gonna have to choose one and not do anythibg in school and if they dont then its their own problem like teachers make students do stuff cause they dont want them to miss out on anything fun or is cool.

I would always agree because sports are fun and a great activity to try even if your bored and dont have anything to do like basketball, Football soccor volleyball and other sports that are fun to play you could even play with your friends if you and your friends dont have any thing to do.

Your gonna have to listen to your principal eitherway your gonna have to choose one or not have fun and your gonna have to work on the boring year book that they do mostly every year before school is out if you dont choose any then your obviously gonna get in trouble if you dont do any one and your probably wont be able to do anyyhing

"Dear Principal,

I think that policy #2 should be set. School is a place where students should go and learn not use phones and be distracted.

Maybe our school says yes to using phones then who are you supposed to text or call? Your mom or dad? That's the thing, you have no reason to use your phone. What if you leave it on a table during lunch and someone steals it? Or maybe your sitting outside with your friends and you loose it. You don't want to have to face the consequences from your parents.

Another reason is your education. Being a student I know what other student would do if you gave them the privilege if having it during the day. Sure you'll tell them to turn it off but think about it, do you honestly think they would? Backing up that is the fact that a student could be texting during class. And once they start, they wont stop. Pretty soon they would have missed the whole lesson, and that wont be fun when a test or their report cards come home. A student could miss the tardy bell because they were too interested in texting their friend.

Setting the first policy, is setting the start for a child's failure in any subject. Say your a principal and also a parent, would you want your child to fail because they wanted to text their friends saying ""What's up?"" No parent wants their child to fail, and no principal should either.

Sincerely,

A student that doesn't want to fail or her friends to fail.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The believe of the ""Face on Mars"" being created by aliens is unlogical. The ""face"" is a simple landform. Why would NASA not tell the people there is aliens? There are images to prove that it's nothing but a natural landform.

First, NASA would make tons of money if there was aliens. The ""Face on Mars"" has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and even radio talk shows. They would make tons of money to be the first space station to find logical information to show that aliens exist; they would go down in history. However, NASA is an informative group; they can't send out false information. That is why they aren't releaseing any information; there is nothing to release.

Second, on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time the MOC team took pictures, pictures that were ten times better than the original. When the team uploaded it online the image revealed nothing but a normal, natural landform. That day was cloudy however so any type of alien finding could have been hidden in the haze.

However people still weren't satisfied, so another image was taken on April 8, 2001, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Which showed nothing again; Garvin stated, ""...you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,"" and, ""So, if there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were!"". Which means that they enlarged the picture and there was nothing there.

In conclusion, one should not believe there is any alien activity to do with the ""Face on Mars"". NASA would get money off having found the first aliens, yet they aren't revealing anything, because there is nothing to reveal. There have been two pictures to prove there is no alien findings on the ""Face on Mars"". The ""Face on Mars"" isn't some alien creation; it's a simple natural landform. ",0,persuade_corpus,0

Two thirds of Hollywoods movies are based on things they know that people wpuld watch. People can put anything in a newspaper or say it on the radio and people would think it was the truth. But you will need research and evidence to make sure what you watch or hear is true. You can also go to the gricey store and hang up any type of posters and make someone believe that what that poster say is the truth.

The face on mars was really a natuarl rock that was shaped like a face. it was discovered on April 5, 1998 when they took better photos.

"Dear State Senator

I would rather want the changing of the election to popular vote because the Electoral college process causes many promblems. First is that it consists of 538 electors and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president(source 1). Also perhaps it leads into a tie in the electoral votings.... it could possibly lead into a deadlocked election(source 1). This process of electoral college does not give the full rights to the voters... its not fair.

My first reason why you guys should change the election to go by popular votes is it causes many promblems, 538 electors is consisted of and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. this tells me that NO people can vote which really does not give you the right to do that because people have always that right to vote. In addition to that it can lead to a big catastrophe. The electoral college process is unfair to voters.

Also why, all that can lead into a tie in the electoral votings. Which equals into a deadlocked election. Lastly, this process is outdated and irrational. arguments against direct elections are spurious and should completely vanish this process.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Phones and Driving

Is your phone or life more important? This is a frequently asked question for people that are so consumed by their phones while driving. As much as technology is a great essential to everyday life it is a huge threat to our lives especially while driving. People will always say ""It's fine I won't crash!"" Then boom one reply to a text that could've been sent when you have reached somewhere safe has taken your life. I want to speak on the importance of not texting while driving or just being on your phone at all, because it can save the lives of many.

I believe that people should not be able to operate a phone at all while driving a vehicle, because not only are you putting your life in danger, you're putting someone else's life in danger as well. ""Reported by the National Safety Council that cell phone use while driving causes 1.6 million crashes each year."" In society people will point the finger to teenagers, but what the world must understand is that everyone plays a big role in this destruction.

Law enforcement officials have tried to crack down on the problem of texting and driving or just occupying a phone in general. This is very hard because they're people out there that use their phones to navigate where they're going but this could also be a distraction. Also, a police officer can't catch every person that they see using a phone while driving and it's not legal to just suspect and pull someone and ask them for their phone. So, in that case there is not much law enforcement officials can do. I believe that law officials should give people warnings and if a car accident is caused by someone not paying attention to the road they should be arrested, because they're putting someone else's life in danger as much as their own. Driving classes that prepare you to take on the road should talk about this subject more and show the numbers of people being killed from accidents caused by phones. If we really want this problem to stop, we as people need to spread awareness on this topic!

The subjest of Leonardo da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa during the Renaissance is a major topic of this research. Mona Lisa shows four emotions: happy, disgust, fear, and anger. The software that Dr. Paul Eckman has created known as FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System. The FACS can recogmize all of Mona Lisa's emotions.   ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"As a child I can remember the many times my teachers would have conversations about pollution. I can remember that they would tell to not throw my trash on the grown and to recycle. But they never told me a major  factor which causes pollution. That factor would be cars The following articles: ""In German suburb,Life goes on without cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky and ""The ene of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. All these articles let us know the effect of pollution and the advantages of reduced car usage. The advantages are great and help reduce the  pollutionin the air.

Less cars can reduce stress on many leves and can also reduce car congestions. In lines 3-4 Heidrun Walter says ""when I had car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Driving a car is a stressful task and a coasting one also. Having to constantly pump gas into your car to make sure you don't run out in the middle of nowhere. Driving responsibly and safely for your safety and other people's safety. But also getting caught in a congestion can cause stress. Having less cars in the streets can reduce congestion. "" congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france."" As stated in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer. Less congestion can mean less accidents which can drasticly reduce the crude death rate all around. It can also increase safety in the streets.

Less car usage can dramaticly affect the pollution being done everyday. ""It's a goood opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As writen in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. The less cars roaming the streets the lower the polution will drop. The lower the pollutin is the better the enviorment will be. Reducing car usage has much more Pros then Cons.

Reducing car ussage has many advantages and perks. It can lower stress as well as pollution. As a bonus it makes the world a tad bit safer. Pollution won't stop in a day but reducing car usage is a great way to start.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Teacher-Designed or Student-Designed Summer Projects

Summer is a time for students to take a break and relax from school, but many classes are making students preform a summer project. Summer projects are given to students to allow them to continue learning even when not in school. The projects push students to work hard all year long. Summer projects are also easy ways for students to work hard and achieve a great score for classes. If a student does well on their summer project, then the teacher will recognize the student is committed and focused on school even when not in the classroom. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they will keep the students on task, push the students to learn, and will prepare students for future year long jobs.

A reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will keep the students on task. On the other hand if the project was to be student-designed then students could easily be sent off track. There are a lot of summer activities that students would like to do, and if a student is only focused on fun activities then the student will not focus on the assigned project. The teacher-designed projects will keep the student on task and give them a way to work on the project but still be able to have fun during their summer break. Keeping the students on task is important and not allowing them to push the project off is a great reason why the teacher-designed project is a better idea.

Another reason explaining why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because it will push the student to learn. If the students are not learning anything from the project then there would be not reason why to have the project assigned to begin with. The students would learn a lot more if the project was made at a teacher standard because it would be just like a test or classwork, but made into a large project for the student. Learning from the project would be very beneficial for the student because they are given a whole summer to work on the project which allows them to learn the material at a slow and steady pace. This is a great reason why the summer project should be teacher-designed and not student-designed.

The last reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will prepare the students for future year long jobs. Most jobs are year long and by giving the students the summer projects they are learning what it is it like to work year long. The students are basically going to be working all year long once they are given their summer projects. This is going to prepare them for what it is like to work all year long once they have a job. Even though the students are given a long time to work on the project, and will still have more of a break than a real job would allow, it is still a very good experience for the students. Many teens are hit hard when they leave school and enter into the workforce because school is much easier than a job. The reason just stated is a great example of why the teacher-designed project would be more beneficial to the students.

There are many of people that would agree with these statements above, but there would be opposers that would disagree. It is true that if the projects were student-designed then the students could work around their schedules to work on the project. That does seem very nice for the students, but there are many more advantages to the teacher-designed projects. Keeping the students on task, pushing the students to learn, and preparing students for future year long jobs are all reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The projects that students receive now should be teacher-designed. This would make them much better for the students in so many great ways. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some countryes do not have the right for vote for who they whant to be president, and the candidate who gets to be the president takes the freedom and security of any person who oppose to him.

It is not fair that something like that could star to thake place in the United States. This country is for the ones that are looking for freedom to have the right to argue their way of thinkind and express, in a good way.

We have the right to know the candidate's potential, knowledge, way of thinking, how he will governate the United States, hir goal for this country, his expectatives, and if he is able to be a leader. Because if we do not have the right to vote, our way of thinking and our rights is not important. The country depends on the persons who live in there, too. There has to be an agreeement  between the citizens, because there has to be a leader who can be able to defend the country and citizens.

The Electoral Collage does not has a democratic method of selectiong a president, and if there is a tie in electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president and the Senate would choose the vide-president.

The Electoral Collage is unfair to voters, outdated, and irrational. The disaster factor was the biggest election crisis, and considerinf that the state legislatures are are responsable for picking the electors.

The Electoral Collage method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

"Driving while using your cell phone has become a very controversial issue currently. Millions of drivers have had mixed feelings and opinions on this subject. In result, people have taken opposing sides. Some believe driving with using your phone isn't such a dangerous task, while others strongly believe it is an action that should never be done by drivers. They argue that this is very unsafe and can distract the driver from paying attention to the road. I agree. I believe that drivers should not use their cellphones while driving.

To begin, driving while using your phone is a very unsafe action. This is because this dangerous action diverts the driver's attention. Drivers are more prone to look at the phone to text or call someone.

When this occurs, drivers are less likely to pay attention to the road, the drivers around them, and their surroundings. Consequently, car accidents are more likely to happen.

On the other hand, some believe driving while using your cellphone isn't a distraction. However, this opinion is false. According to edgarsnyder. com, a credible personal injury law firm, it stated, ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" This statistic shows the absolute dangers driving while texting can cause. All in all, driving and using your phone is very dangerous and unsafe to the driver, passengers, and all people on the road.

In conclusion, driving while using or operating your cellphone is a dangerous act. Drivers should be paying attention to the road, not their phones. Cellphones offer huge distractions due to the easy accessibility to text messaging, video messaging, and all social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat, YouTube, and Facebook. It is a huge distraction and severe consequences will almost always occur.          ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I agree that students should have to take an extracurricular. Have you ever had to take one? I have, and there are so many options! There are sports, art and life skill classes that I think can all have valuable lessons to teach students. An extracurricular can benefit some students who are already involved in an extra activity, help your grades or athleticism, and it can improve your social skills with an activity such as being in the student council. They can help you in so many ways which is why is think it's a good idea for everyone to have to take at least one.

I think teaching students about things for example, how to take care of themselves and what foods are healthy and which ones aren't can help them outside of the school environment. If a student learns how to be healthier and learns different ways to exercise then their performance in their sport is going to improve. It'll also improve their scores in gym and make them an overall better athlete. Iv'e also experienced this on my own. As a runner, things like your diet and exercise plan are important. Learning early on how to control and manage these things will help you all around. So, an extracurricular being mandatory isn't bad at all if it is sure to help you.

Most activities that the school offers will help a student academically, which is why they're always encouraged. There are so many options for classes because there is always something you can be better at. For instance, taking science exploration will make you better in science. There is almost always a class that is related to one of the ones you already take. Classes that aren't like computer technology, band, or Spanish help you prepare for things later on, even if there isn't a core class directly related to it. Taking Spanish is a great way to improve your English. For me,

Spanish is counted as a high school credit, so that when I get to high school I would already have a credit counted towards my diploma.

Another way one of these classes will help you is that it will definitely improve your social skills. Every class that you will take is going to have other people in there, that at some point, you are going to have to work with. Teamwork is a great life skill that everyone should learn. You can't always do everything on your own, and might need someone else's help, so knowing how to work with other people to achieve a common goal is important. Classes related to theater or yearbook involve a lot of communicating with others and if it's hard for you then these courses can help you work on it. Other things like being in the student council can teach you leadership, which is just as important.

Overall, I think that extracurricular courses always have something to offer to your education and prepare you for things you do in your everyday life. There are so many different classes you can take to help you with whichever your studying, or whatever you enjoy the most. I don't think that iv'e ever taken one that hasn't helped me in some way, and I enjoy most of them anyways.

I think that having at least one of these classes everyday is a good idea, and I hope you do too!",0,persuade_corpus,3
"A self driving car? Are people really that lazy? Ha! Well duh! I sure know I. It would be awesome to have a self driving car. I could text while Im driving, I could get on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and so much more! If they have what they say there going to have uou could possibly just watch whatever you want to watch.

"Do you drive a car? A truck? Or any kind of vehicle? If so, did you know your polluting the air? Why drive when you could car-pool, walk, or even ride a bike? Why risk your life everyday while driving your car into town to go to work?

To start off with, pollution is a big affect in this world today. China is one of the most polluted cities in the world. As stated in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog''

states that diesel fuel was blamed for pollution. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Have you ever seen someone black smoke? They probably think they are cool, but they aren't. What they are really doing is polluting the air, and it isn't cool.

Ever thought about car-pooling? Riding a bike? Or even walking to work, or school, or even to the mall? In my opinion those are some great ways to get around town. I understand if you live far out of town and you cant walk or ride a bike but maybe think about car-pooling. I would love  to car-pool with one of my friends to school. You have a friend to sit there and talk to you. Your doing someone a favor. Plus you never know when you'll see them again. You could always organize your life so you could walk or even get someone you could car-pool with.

Everyday you wake up not knowing what could happen. You get in your car not thinking anything bad could happen to you and then

BAM

! Another car as ran the red light or the stop sign and ran into you. And just like that your killed. You see, walking is easier to get around. Your still risking your life but not as bad as you are if your in a car. There is so many stupid out there that is driving drunk, high, or whatever. Their is even people out there that think they are cool when they really aren't. There are a lot of deaths out there that are caused by vehicles. So before you get in the car, think about walking. It's safer.

Now did you think about car-pooling, walking, or even riding a bike. Did you think about pollution or even your life. You might not agree with me but think about it for a little bit. I rather walk and get some exercise then sit in a car.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In my opinion I think the Seagoing Cowboys was a wonderful experience. I was asked by my good friend Don to join and I thought why not. This would be a great opportunity to interact with people in need and travel around the world. I automatically signed up.

We started our expedition in August of 1945. I got to see many places during the program. That included a gondola ride in Venice, an Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and much much more. This program is excellent if you aren't a very worldly person, but even if you are it's great to see more!

This program is also good to be more involved in excercise. You have to feed and water the animals two are three times a day. Also, stalls have to be cleaned. When you spend so much time with the animals it sort of creates a bond between the two of you. However it just wasn't work and work, sometimes you have to take a break. Whenever the animals were unloaded we got to do fun activities like baseball, volleyball, fierce table-tennis tournaments, you get the idea. So that's how to get an easy workout!

This program makes you realize how much we take for granted. People are constantly starving or dehydrated, whenever we think that food and liquid is something easy to come by. Also countries are suffering under constant warfare and are very vurnerable. This program allows you to understand what it's actually like to really suffer.

These are the reasons that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It really opens you up, by helping people all over the world. This is why I believe more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Cell phones are an inescapable part of modern life, providing information and connection that has become an expected part of everyone's routine. However, this becomes complicated the moment your phone and car meet. On one hand, the GPS is an essential tool for any road trip, on the other, distracted driving is dangerous, and sometimes fatal. A balance needs to be struck, one where you can drive without distractions, and still get where you need to go.

For many people, the use of their phone is non-negotiable. Either for location, or for podcasts and music that break the monotony of a daily commute. At the same time using one's phone has a notable impact on one's performance driving. In many states, the solution proposed is to make it illegal to touch one's phone while driving. This allows a GPS to give directions, or for a person to dictate calls or voice commands while reducing the amount of time spent looking away from the road.

With hands free driving, someone can still interact with their cellular device, give commands, find directions, and communicate with others while still looking at the road. With smartphones offering voice assistants, it's no longer necessary for people to directly interface with their phones, meaning people are no longer spending as much time looking down at their phones and away from the road.

If people were no longer allowed to use their phones on the road, while crashes may decrease, people would be cut off from a world where doing so is becoming increasingly detrimental. It would be foolish to walk away from such increasing connectivity for an extreme solution such as banning cellphones in cars. Such a ban would be an overly drastic solution to a more nuanced problem, leaving people greatly inconvenienced for the sake of a heavy handed solution.

If a proper balance is able to be found between reducing the distractions phones provide to drivers and maximizing the amount of benefit still available to them, it would be greatly preferable to an all out ban on the devices in cars, and would reduce road fatalities and crashes while still maintaining the accessibility and convenience smartphones provide on a daily basis. So no, phones should not be banned on roads, but they should not be unregulated either, as with many issues, it is not black and white, and to approach it as such would be to ignore the vastly superior solutions hiding in the swatches of grey between the two extremes.

"Should school summer projects be created by students or teachers?

Imagine its the last day of school , everyone is excited to get out of school, but the teacher said there will be a summer project. Everyone would be upset and disapointed, but what if that teacher gave you a choice to create your own summer assignment? Although some people say summer assignments are more effective, actually summer assignments are more effective when created by students.

Some people think summer assignments are better off in the hands of a teacher, because they believe teachers have more experience, and can provide the best preparation for the following year. For instance, you have a history teacher teaching world history, but towards the end of fourth quarter he gives you a large packet on US history to complete for a summer project. This shows that the specific teacher who was teaching world history, is trying to prepare the student the best he can, by providing him with a project with all the information he needs to know to succeed in a history class the following year.

However, if students were given a choice to design their own summer projects, they would be able to work on topics they enjoy, which will change the mood on summer assignments forever. For instance, if a teacher decided to give summer assignments over the long break, she would give her students a big boring projects thats due in the fall. However, if that teacher gave the student a choice to create thier own project, it could be portrayed from their own personal interests, which would make the student much more excited to complete the project. Furthermore, if something interests you, you will be excited to do it, but if something is boring, than you are more likely to feel depressed about doing it, which would eventually lead to procrastination.

On the other hand, if students were given a choice to create their own summer project, the rate of missing projects would decrease tremendously. For instance, a teacher gives everyone a project on world war one, but the people who enjoy wars and the event of world war one would do the project with excitement, while others would do it because they want good grades. However, if students created their own project, it would allow everyone the right to choose thier own topic. This would make everyone excited to do thier own project. This will also allow students to pick out thier particular interest, which will make them more likely to do the project leading to the downfall of missing assignments.

Also, if students were given a choice to design their own summer project, it possibly could influence them and in the future they might consider going into a teaching major. For instance, if a student was designing a project, and had great interest in planning the project itself, it might give him an inspiration to become a teacher in the future. This not only will help the student plan his future, but it would also allow others to find their future as well. If all the students were allowed to plan their own summer project, there could be a possibility that at least one of the students enjoyed planning the project ultimately influencing them to become a teacher.

In conclusion, students should have the choice to design their own summer projects, because of the benefits it provides. This would not only cause the rate of missing projects to decline, but it will also let students chose their topics for their projects, making the student excited to complete the assignment. It will also create a plan for students who enjoyed planning the project, ultimately influencing them to go into a teaching major.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The introduction of article is Venus an twin planet of Earth terms of density and size and it also called evening star because it the one brightest points of light during night sky.

"When the word summer comes to teenagers' minds, fun or sun is a common thought. Summer vacation is time away from education, but many schools require completion of projects over the break. The purpose of projects is to assure the continuation of learning. In order for students to maintain increasing growth, schools must consider the best form of education over the long-awaited break. There is controversy over whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. For the best form of educational progression, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience, the projects have more structure, and academic performance increases.

Many people would argue that student-designed projects would appeal to other students better. Teenagers gravitate towards making friends through shared interests and ideas. Although the shared bond of age may seem like a reason for students to understand each other, everybody is unique in his or her own mind. The student that designed a summer project for a whole class may find that assignment more interesting than the others do. There is no guarantee of appeal for everyone in the class because of the various personality types in the world. Student-designed projects focus on what the creator is interested in, while teacher-designed projects tend to think of what interests the majority of students. Educators have been exposed to the different personalities they have taught, so they have an idea of what would equally appeal a class as a whole.

For the creation of a summer project, teachers have more experience with a wide-range of students. Whenever teenagers attend school, their objective is to achieve an academic diploma while maintaining a social life. They have not considered how all of their peers think and learn. Teachers are trained to create lesson plans that suit most of the students in a school. All educators need to obtain a degree before they can go into the workplace. Most of them have completed a course of psychology or sociology to better understand the behaviors of young adults. With years of experience academically and in the workplace, teacher are more likely to succeed in creating a project that fits a majority of students.

Teacher-designed summer projects would have more structure for an easier learning experience. Along with academic and behavioral experience, teachers need organizational skills. They are well-adapted to a learning environment and have a multitude of deadlines each week. Educators become more aware of the average pace an assignment can be completed within a variety of students, which leads to a better determination of the workload for a summer project. Also, teachers are given a curriculum for a course at the beginning of each year from the school board. They can take into account what pupils need to know to be prepared for the following course. The information learned inside each course can be adjusted for what teachers think will help students succeed in future academics, while allowing teenagers to complete assignments at a reasonable pace.

An increase in academic progression occurs when projects are teacher-designed. Educational performance in students holds a high level of importance as statistics are recorded then reviewed each year. Schools are constantly looking for strategies of improvement. Teachers have access to more resources that can be provided for completion of the project, while student-designed projects solely rely on the creator's background knowledge of the subject or research online that may not be as reliable. The success rate increases for learners as the projects utilize the information needed in the future, rather than excess knowledge that is not useful. An expansion of achievements requires teacher format rather than student creation.

The making of teacher-designed projects improves academics as the experience level is higher in teachers, assignments contain more organization, and success increases within students. Teachers have workplace experience with different types of behaviors, so they can create a project that will interest many students. Also, educators plan out a reasonable workload for students to complete while including entertainment. With the high amount of knowledge and resources teachers have, students can reach a greater potential of educational progression. Teachers are the most selfless people as their career is to help others grow without much incentive. When people advocate to maximize educators' training and experience, by having them design assignments, it will assist society in building a better future for later generations.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The Facial Coding System is a new computer that can recongize and calculate your emotions based on subtle facial movements. The software produced by Professor Huang and Professor Sebe works by constructing a 3-D model of a face and classifing it based on six basic emotions that humans typically express. The those emotions are then charaterised by movements of the facial muscles. In my opinion we should embrace new technology, but the question is, how will this change schools, marketing, and everyday life?

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" according to Dr. Huang. He goes on to say that the software can modify the lesson, like an ""effective human instructor. "" Imagaine being able to adjust a lesson to the liking of the majority of students, being able to create insteresting and engaging topics for students and teachers to enjoy. Not only that, many students will experience depression or anxiety during their middle school or high school life, this computer can help consulors help those students more effectively. Overall, schools could see a massive change in students moods after introducing this software.

Shcools wouldn't be the only ones to take advatange of this new technonlogy, companys that are trying to market and sell their product could calculate what is liked and disliked based on the emotions analyised after people view their products. Some people would make the claim that it is an invasion of priviacy, but wouldn't we want companys to sell the things we like, rather than the things we don't? Imagaine always having excatly what you like or excatly what you need pop up in an ad, or suddenly become available at the nearest store. Not only do you get what you need, companys will be able to make more money, helping the economy grow, and hopfully that money makes its way back to you someday.

Aside from schools and marketing, how can this effect everyday life? The articles states that

""we humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday."" we may not be able to tell the precentage of a person sadness or happiness, but we can determine when a friend is excited or bored. Imagaine being able to calculate your own happiness like weighing your self on a scale. Imagine that the software not only measures your happiness, but analyises what may be causing your stress and how to improve as a person. The world may truly becoming a better place.

The Facial Action Coding System seems far from becoming wildy accessiable to the public, but to me this new computer software will one day change our lives. From school, to companys, and our own personal life, this technonlogy can one day make life a little bit happier.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Ching Ching! This is the sound you might hear more and more as our world starts to rely less on outomobles. There are some advantages to this, there will be less air polution, less fossil fuels being burned, and less accidents. As with everything, there are always two sides of the arguement too.

First, there will be less polution because there will be less, or no automobles creating it. cars contribute 12 percent of the Earth's greenhouse gasses. Other countries have begun setting days that people can't drive becasue the polution gas gotten so substantial.

Another reason it would be helpful to use automobles less is because the majority of them burn fossil fuels to make them run, and this is devistating our worlds fuel supply. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, and if we burn up all of it that we have, we will never have it agin.

Last, there will be less accident, which will result to less people getting injured or worse. There are so many automobile accident every year, if we cut them out of out society, the accident rate would be decreassed substansally.

"Dear Principle,

I have wrote this letter to discuss with you about cell phone use in school.

Cell phones should not be aloud in school at all.

Kids should keep their cell phones in their locker and leave them in their for the rest of the day.

I have suggested this to you for the safety of the everyone.

In this letter I will show how dangerous cellular use during school can be.

In middle school bullying is common.

One of the most common forms of bullying is cyber bullying.

You as a principle would discourage bullying to keep the school a happy safe place.

With cell phones aloud in school cyber bullying will be more common.

Other children may take embarrassing and hurtful pictures of others.

Bulling is very serious and sometimes lead to death and with cell phones aloud in school a students life could be put into jeopardy .

Children and teens are put into school so they can grow up to having a successful life.

Cell Phones are a huge distraction to learning.

Even though the cell phones are not aloud in class kids will still use them in class secretly.

In free time kids should be doing something productive to help them learn.

Instead of reading a book a student would be texting.

Cell phones destroy the school's safe learning environment.

At any school the hallways are a dangerous place while students are trying to get from class to class.

Cell Phones would make the hallways hectic.

Students would be texting while running into each other because they are not paying attention to where they are going.

Someone will get hurt and if it is a serious injury the school could suffer from losing money we need.

Cell phones are a safety hazard and should not be aloud during school hours.

Thank you for your time and I hope that you have taken some of things that i said into consideration for the safety of our school.

Sincerely,

One of your students",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Do you believe schools should make students do at least one extracurricular activity? Because, I think you should be able to choose if you want to. Some people believe you should make students do this stuff, but it just doesn't seem right to me. Some people physically can't make it to things like this. Making students do an extracurricular activity could cause less family time, or distraction to life and school, or even make them upset because they can't find an activity that fits them.

First, some kids already have limited family time. They wake up and go to school for about 7 hours, then they come home and do their home work, and that right there is a lot of hours taken away which means only a few hours is left for family. A lot of kids want more family time and making them do stuff like this would just make it worse. Some parents even make their kids do things like chores. If they have a activity they have to do then they would have to do chores on the weekend when they are free and actually are with their family.

Secondly, if students have to do an activity, it could end up distracting them from doing their work. Some might end up liking it so much to the point where it takes all their time away from studying and homework. But others, could end up disliking it so much that they stress about having to do it to the point where it's such a big distraction they can't focus because they are anxious about even going. So it could go either way and end up bad for the students.

Lastly, some students get so upset that they can't find something they enjoy. Sports and these types of clubs aren't for everyone. When trying to find an activity, it can be hard for students. If they can't find something they like, they tend to get very anxious and upset. They don't have activities for every type of person at school, and that's why some students just don't fit in with clubs.

Therefore, I suggest that no one should make students do extra activities like that if they don't want to, it's not for everyone and that's okay. If a student really wanted to do an activity like that, then they would. I believe suggesting activities like this to students would be very nice, but don't control them. What do you believe? Should students have to do an extracurricular activity? ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Many times during online activites, students can become confused or just simply bored. They often need their teacher to come and explain the topic to them because the online course or activity just simply isn't helping them in a way that works for them. The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to both the students and the teachers in schools. This technology can enable online programs to be modified to the students needs, whether they're lost or just uninterested, and it can help the children more efficiently when the teacher has their hands full. The Facial Action Coding System would be an overall help to struggling students and teachers everywhere.

Bored students are never a good thing. No student looks at a boring assignment and thinks, ""Wow, I really want to do this assignment for the next hour."" A bored student leads to an unmotivated student who isn't trying very hard, and there is nothing more boring than staring at a screen for some period of time doing homework. In the sixth paragraph of the article it states that this technology could recognize when a student is becoming bored and modify the lesson like a real human instructor. This could keep students engaged and interested in the lesson. They would be more willing to complpete their work than if the lesson were monotonous. The Facial Action Coding System could eliminate bored students everywhere.

Teachers in public schools can have up to 40 students in one class and they can't help all of them at once. Teachers are human, they can't be in two places at once or helping two students at once. With the Facial Action Coding System, computers can modify their lesson and teaching to specific students and give them the help that they need to understand the standards. All students don't learn the same way and all teachers cannot possibly have time to help each and every one of their students individually. This technology can make studies a little bit easier for everyone, even the adults.

This technology would be very valuable in schools, especially in the times we're currently living in. Almost everything is online nowadays. Classes that taught how to write in cursive are being replaced with classes that teach how to type correctly on a keyboard. In many schools you will find children carrying around laptops instead of textbooks. You can even take college courses online. Why wouldn't you want to make the online learning experience even better by allowing the computers to customize themselves to the specific student?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would vastly improve the educational experience of students all around the world. If a student were confused or bored, the computer would adjust itself to keep the student understanding and engaged in the lesson. The computers would be able to provide just as good of help as the teacher would, thereby lessening the workload of the teacher and making sure the students are still getting all the explanations and teaching they need. Technology is everywhere, in almost every classroom. Improving the way it works would be improving our student's education and in time, their futures. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"A claim that evaluates the author idea is... No matter how hard they try and study about the Venus and learn how to land there safetly, its still going to be a dangrous. like every time u send some one there to study, the spacecraft cant land for a hours and they get in danger. The author kinda want people to just give it up. no matter what you do, Venus will be Venus. In the article it says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". Venus is a earth twin but u should never dream to go there. There is no spacecraft that survive landing in Venus. In the article it says ""No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". The spacecraft cant survive it because the Venus is so hot. NASA is working on other approaches to studing Venus. They be sending people to Venus just to study Venus. They are trying harder and harder. They are now using some old technology called mechanical computers to study Venus. The mechanical computers were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War ll. NASA wont give up on studying Venus. People didnt know what Venus is before. Back then, Venus was coverd by tree and and mountains just like the earth. Now you can see it at the night time. Venus is called the "" Evening Star,"". It is one of the brightest light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. The Venus is the dangrous planet that u should never go. No spacecraft servived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is working very hard to study about the Venus and maybe wanna map everything on it. Venus is the ""Evening star,"" that u can see it at night time. People who wants to study about Venus are now using old mechanical Computers.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear principal,

I think you should make it a requirement to all students to provide at least 100 hours of community service because if we were all to go downtown and pick up a full large bag of garbage from the streets our town would be much more cleaner and nicer.

I also think it would be a good idea to visit the elderly a couple times and maybe read to them or play a board game with them.

If the elderly don't have anyone to talk to or play with the last years of their life they` re going to die sad and lonely.

What we can also do is have people and students walked around the school and look for trash then we can have a cleaner school.

And I think you should make it a grade to do because if students think they can stay home and do nothing while other student go and do the work then they` re wrong.

Imagine if no one cleaned the streets and just left them like that with McDonald and Burger King wrappers on the ground.

the streets would look like a total wasteland and junkyard all pilled with millions of peoples trash.

If we live in them don't you think it` s our responsibility to clean them and take care of them.

If students walk the streets and go to the stores and buy candy and food then leave the trash on the ground instead of taking two steps the garbage can in front of you.

I also think we should put garbage cans out on every block so people can put their garbage into.

This is why you should make it a requirement to serve at least 100 hours of community service.

"Today, 1976, we found a face on the land of mars. When we all saw the picture we get surprised.

Sence the day of that picture all of us working in NASA tried to find out what was that. It did have a great impact to NASA because if someone else saw the picture, it will make panic to the audience and the world.

So all those years we studied mars and it's land's forms to see if there were others that look a like. We didn't find other that look a like so people start to make their own ideas of the face.

Most people though that was made for aliens, but it wasn't. We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land. And one of are partners came with the idea of a natural structure or a mesa. He think in that because if people or aliens live in there it's most be something in there that help us see if they live in there.

NASA send people to see if they could find something in there that may help us, but not.

So we decided to show it to the world because it was just a mesa. People got scared in the start but when they see that there were no aliens they relax and some studious used that for movies, books, etc.

And sense that day everyone it's okay with stuff that they don't understand, because they know that is just something new. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In this writing prompt I will be supporting the authors argument. The author belives that Venus should be explored and belives exploring Venus would bring plentiful information that could help the world learn more about other plantes and ours. But for this to be an arguemnt there must be a danger or bad factor, the bad harmful factor is the dangers on Venus. Venus has many dangers that has harmed unmanned spacecrafts. More dangers will be explained further in the prompt.

Venus is often called Earths twin, Venus is the planet that is most related to earth in terms of density and size. But Venus has many more dangers than Earth. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide wich means humans will not be able to breath the air. Venus's surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earths pressure. Because of the extremely high amount of pressure that would crush a submarine and melt any metal humans would nto be caple of landing on the surface of Venus without being crushed. And not only does Venus have very high tempertures, pressure and a deadly atmosphere, it also has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.

So why would we want to explore Venus if it is so inhospitable? Venus may have once had been like earth, with oceans and lifeforms. Venus does have a rocky surface with valleys, moutains and craters. Venus could be the human races next planet to inhabit if an incident would occur to Earth. Venus is the planet that is most like earth with its terrain and possible past life and water. Although Venus has its deadly dangers to humans, scientists are creating ways for humans to explore Venus and learn about this twin planet.

"" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus,5)

that statement from the excerpt states that scientists have come up with their theorys to explore Venus. They have an idea to send Humans above Venus's atmosphere to explore Venus so they do not melt by the extremely high tempertures or get crushed by the high pressure. With these ideas humans could explore Venus without being harmed and could gather needed information about the twin planet. Scientists are also working on other approaches to studying Venus with possible electronic devices that could last possibly up to three weeks on Venus's surface. With more time scientists could create more ideas and plans to explore Venus's surface.

In this prompt I have explained the twin planet, Venus, and the dangers it holds. The author of the excerpt, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I have also explained the dangers Venus posses such as the high tempertures and the extremely high pressure. Scientists are creating more and more theorys of ways to explore

Venus everyday. Therefore in the future I do belive we will explore Venus and that exploring Venus would be very plentiful to the humans race.                  ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I think you should let students used their cell phones during free periods. It would give them a chance to relax and talk to their friends while they can without being next to them. Also, it will give them more responsibility to turn off their phones when their free time is over. The students would be happier and be able to express themselves more if they were able to choose to use their phones.

Everyone likes to talk to their friends when they can. Letting students use their phones in school would let them do that. They would not have to be right next to the other person and they would be able to ask about school things if they needed to like homework and class work. Also, students would be able to get all of their talking out of the way so they are focused for when they go back to class. Other kids who are trying to be rude to people texting and talking to their friends on their phone would not be able to get into the conversation and get the other person upset.

It would be a big responsibility to have phones in school. Students would be able to use them during any free period they want as long as they got turned off when they got back to class. This would help teach responsibility more because there would be less phones getting taken away. Teachers would also get to see if their students would follow the rules and turn their phones off. Also, if students had to turn their phones off and they did, there would be less phones getting sunk into the classroom and used.

You can tell a lot about a person by the amount of time they use their phones. Some use them every chance they get, and some barely use their phones. Students at school would be able to express themselves more by being able to use their phones and the teachers would be able to know who they are better.

Girls and boys would be happier and even make more friends at school better then they were able to before. They'd be able to relate to other people more. There would possibly be less bullying because they wouldn't be able to see other peoples' conversations and make fun of them for what they say to their friends.

Students at schools always use their phones. If they were able to use them during free periods, they would be more relaxed and able to talk to their friends more often, it would teach them responsibility to turn their phones off when they go back to class, and they would be happier and able to express themselves more in school.

"On Mars we have discovered a landmark that seems to resemble a face. Some believe it was made by aliens. People believe this because of how much it resembles a human face. However they do not have evidence to back that up.

Scientists can prove that their claims are inaccurate. They can prove this because, there is landmarks like this in the Midwest of America. Scientists belive that it was just another Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia. The only difference was this one had unusual shadows which caused others to believe it was made by aliens.

Astronauts from NASA went back up again to get another picture. They had took a good picture. Although peoplethat believed it was made by aliens argued it was a cloudy picture. NASA sent another mission up into space to prove them wrong once again. They took a picture on a clear day and still found no proof that it was alien made. This time they used a better camera so people who believed could not say it was because of the picture this time.

In conclusion you can't prove that it was alien made. Scientists have proven again and again that aliens did not make the Mesa. It may look as if someone, or something has made it but that did not happen. It is just an odd shaped Mesa like the ones in the Midwest. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Student should be able to work from home? I personally think they should. Many kids like to be in a different learning environment from other students. Sometimes its hard for students to focus when theres a lot of people in one classroom. Working from home could probably benefit many students.

There are many kids that like to be home while doing their school work to be in their own comfort. Student may even like the help their parents provide more than their teachers. Many schools have illness and safety issues going around and some parents may want they children to be at home. There could be many reasons to be home schooled. Every student is different and needs different ways to learn.

All teachers usually have a large class. Some students may need that extra attention from their teacher when it comes to learning. It sometimes takes a lot for people to learn individually. When there is only one teacher in a big class, it could be somewhat hard to tend to one student because others are going to need help also. Working from home could come in place of that when you have the extra assistance at home.

The way technology is set up today, It could be really convient to work on a computer. Being that children are so attached to electronics nowadays it would be so much easier to do their work. I personally like working off of a computer. When I have to do work at home, I usually prefer it to be done on a computer. Its much easier to get work done from home and on technology.

online working could be a good source for many students. Its really a good decision to make for children that cant work in school. Students dont really get their work done in school because of their surroundings such as other students. I would recommend homeschooling for anyone that cant focus on their work. This could be a great opportunity for many students. This decision could improve grades, ability to work and the ability to concentrate.                                                                                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"There are many advantages of limiting car usage, such as it saves gas and it helps relieve stress.  ""Its a ood opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""(Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota) says a business man that goes by the name Carl Arturo Plaza.  There are amny different ways to get from point A to point B and Back to point A in a safe, and helpful way. Such as taking the bus, taxi, carpooling, bike riding, or even skating.

Limiting car usage saves gas because you can use someonjes elses gas instead of your own and you can conserve yur gas when ever you really need to use it to go to the store or get something that you really need later on tin the day when you get bac to point A  and see and use your car.

"summertime learning

Some students would not be happy about having a project to do over the summer and some students would be excited to do a project. However, if the students picked their own ideas and came up with what they want their project to be on, more students would agree to doing it. Teachers might pick a project that the students might not be interested in. Although, their are lot of positive things that comes with students picking their own projects to do. Such as, they will be more interested in the topic, they can come toghether and group up, also they will be sure to complete it.

Students would not be to happy about having to do a project over the summer but, if they came up with their own projects they wont think to much about it and they will be more interested in doing it. They will take their time on it and be ready to turn it in to the teacher when they go back to school. For example, when I get projects over breaks, I think about it, come up with ideas, try them out, and if i like it then I would continue on it. However, if the teacher designs it, it wont be so interesting, it will get boring, but you would still have to complete it though.

Second, they can get into groups and come up with ideas on what to do. That can be good because they will all come together as one, learn more about eachother, and focuse on completing the project. Sometimes the teachers design who they will be doing it with and its no fun like that. Its better if the students kind of did everything their way with a tad bit of knowledge from the teacher.

In conclusuon, this is why students should design their own projects to do instead of the teacher because there are alot of things that comes with them picking their won projects.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The use of cars and mobile technology has done nothing but grow in our society without ceasing. However, the use of these cellular devices while driving can be fatal to the driver and to others. If the driver is overly distracted and is not paying attention, it can cause them to veer off the road or hit innocent, bystanding, pedestrians. The use of technology could also be used for good. GPS helps most people on this earth, get to where they need to go. Although, this can also lead to them getting distracted, some apps have it, so that the driver can simply hear the directions. The usage of cellular devices shouldn't be restricted completely, but limited to using GPS.

The amount of car accidents due to drivers being distracted by their phones, is at 1.6 million per year. This is mostly texting and driving, or being on social media while operating a vehicle. Actively using phones while driving should be restricted because of the danger to the driver, passengers, and the pedestrians that are around. Most of the drivers that are making these mistakes, are teenagers that don't know better. Teen drivers, or new drivers in general, should take a proper drivers ed class, that'll teach them proper drivers etiquette. This will inform them of the dangers of texting and driving, and teach them techniques to avoid temptation.

Although the use of cell phones should be restricted, it shouldn't be completely prohibited. Drivers often use their phones for GPS in this day and age. If phones are permanently prohibited, then drivers won't be able to use their mobile map. It navigates the driver to where they need to go. Apps have been programmed so that drivers can use their GPS hands-free. They also input a feature that will speak the directions out loud so the driver doesn't feel the constant need to pick their phone up and read the directions. All the driver has to do is input their destination in before the vehicle starts moving. Phones while driving doesn't need to be prohibited.

Some people will argue that the usage of any phones can start any car accident. While that is true, it is highly unlikely and implausible. Although texting and driving is the cause of many car accidents, it's not the cause for ALL of them. Phones cannot be blamed for every car accident that happens. In fact, drunk driving is the cause for 31% of car accidents that occur in the country. Taking away the cell phone completely from use in the vehicle, will have a poor effect on the drivers who need GPS to go to new places and don't end up lost. It will lead to drivers needing maps, which are often hard to read and hard to keep track of.

Getting rid of cell phone use while driving completely, may seem like a smart idea at first, but it doesn't make sense once really contemplated. It would alter the country's way of driving, and not in a good way. Maybe there would be less accidents, but there are still drunk drivers to worry about. Cell phone usage while driving should not be strictly prohibited, but rather restricted for all uses except for GPS.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"My name is Luke Bomberger, and I just got back from an amazing trip from being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I got to help animals recover from World War ll, and this trip was an amazing, and beautiful adventure. This program is hard work, and I know that some people aren't interested in helping animals, or working hard.

But, this is a really good program that I want to tell you about.

Maybe by the end of this article you will be convinced to join this program with me.

What did I have to do on this trip you ask? I had to help animals recover from World War ll.

This was a fun job, because even though this was hard work the animals are fun to play around with. If you don't take this job those animals won't have any body to take care or play around with them.

I know some of you don't really care for animals, but what's better: watching you favorite Tv show or helping poor animals recover from World War ll ?

The animals are a great part of this experience, but do you want to know what I really loved about this trip? I adored all of the tourist attractions on my way to China, and the great experience this was.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable for a small-town boy like me.

Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

I loved the gondola ride in Venice Italy, it was beautiful to see the streets of water.

When I toured that excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China, it was amazingly beautiful.

"Asking more than one person for advise can be goo because, everyone has different thoughts and experiences so different answers from different people will help with whatever you need advice about.

Even if the person dose not completely agree with you.

Firstly, When making a choice you have to pick between two different things.

Most of the time its a rather hard decision. picking one thing is never easy so as a human you ask someone else for there opinion or advice.

They may have a different opinion or maybe even the same but you may not completely trust just one opinion so you ask another person what they think.

After, asking another person for their advice which may help you to come to a conclusion an make a decision based off of what you were told and what you think is best.

Asking for advise could be for better of for worse, maybe even something as simple as what shirt matches your pants the best. Weither the problem is big or small you can always ask for advise.

Second, Look at it like this, lets say you ask your mom for advise about a boy an then you ask your best friend.

Obviously their both going to think different things you mom isnt going to want to see you get your heart broken and your best friend is going to want whats best for you. They both might think the same thing which would help you realize that maybe that boy isnt to good for you.

If their opinions are different then you might want to ask third person to break the tie or just take the first advise you get and move on.

Lastly, Some people may prefer their own opinion or advise in some situations.

Not all decisions can be made alone someone needs help at some point. They may think they make better choices when they make them alone also not all problems need help and can be solved alone. Then again, some people do work better when they are alone. Asking multiple opinions can be helpful or just plain out pointless. If the person you ask for advise thinks the same thing as you then it was point less to even bring them into something that couldÃÂ´ve been solved your self.

Asking another person may just bring up your confidence because they have the same opinion as you do, if they disagree it could make you think, ÃÂ¨am I making the right decisionÃÂ¨.

In conclusion, Making a decision can be hard and confusing an you may not always need advise. Asking another person for advice that you just cant make a decision on can benefit yo or be pointless and help at the same time.

Making confidence go up that you made the right decision or someone dis agreeing with you either way it helps you come to a decision easier.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Venus is one of the brightest stars in the solar system and is consitered to be the ""second sun"". It is almost as dense as earth and is said to be called ""earths twin"". The planet has been studied very closely even though we are miles and miles away. The planet is almost impossible to land on. Every spaceship that has landed has crashed or dissapeared. The atmosphere is so dense taking a regular iphone there would melt entering each layer of the atmophere.

The most challenging point to venus is it's atmospheric pressure which is ninety times greater then earth and has the ground tempurature eight hundred degrees fairenheit. Scientists have seeen many volcanos and lightning outbursts very close in intrevals of time on Venus which can make landing and space travel difficult. NASA says orbiting, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Which means the ground would ""liquify metal"".

Since Venus is one of the closest planets we could possibly travel too. NASA has been experimenting and planning.

"Distance learning is an ever-growing way of reaching students that are unable, or unwilling, to attend a traditional school. Creating a way for students to attend classes from home is a very practical and useful innovation, and through it, many students will receive education that they might not otherwise get. By implementing computer learning on in a widespread manner, students from all backgrounds and economic standpoints will be able to learn and succeed. Students will also be able to stay up to date with schoolwork if an illness or other injury prevents them from going to school for long amounts of time. Distance learning can also help those who are unable to access a school, such as rural families.

One of the leading arguments for the cause of widespread poverty in inner cities is poor education programs. In areas such as Generic_City, schools are understaffed and underfunded, leading to very high dropout rates. Families that can afford to, send their children to private schools, often costing thousands of dollars per year. Distance learning could solve this problem. By creating a county wide virtual learning database, students can pursue their education without having to be in school. Although some of these students may not have access to a computer, libraries are available for those driven and determined to better themselves.

There are many cases in which an injury or illness precludes students from going to school. Both physical and mental health issues can result in the inability to attend traditional school. Distance learning could be a lifesaver for these students. By giving them access to lessons, homework, and tests, they are able to stay up to date and current, even if being out of school for several months. Car accidents are a leading contributor to students having to stay home for long periods of time. Injuries to the spine or head can result in limited mobility or capabilities for extended amounts of time. Because of this, students often have to graduate later than planned, which can jeopardize college acceptance and scholarships. Through distance learning, students can stay engaged and up to date with classroom activities, and lessen the impact of missing school for extended amounts of time.

Rural areas in states across the U.S. often have very low standards of education. Due to people living very spread out and secluded from one another, school systems are haphazard and low quality. Students in rural areas also often have to help out with either a farm or a business and are unable to attend school during a traditional school day. This is where distance learning plays a part. Through the use of computers to access video lessons, students can take classes on their own schedule and from their own homes.

Although distance learning seems like an ideal way to learn, there are several downsides to it. One of which is a less flexible curriculum. Due to lessons being in video form, teachers are unable to tailor lessons to fit the needs of particular students or classes. This can lead to students being unresponsive and not being able to learn the material due to the way that it is presented. Because of this, students may have to seek out additional resources to fully understand the material that is being presented to them.

Distance learning is an exciting and innovative form of learning that is being put into place around the world. Through the use of online lessons and videos, students who do not have access to traditional schools are given a chance to learn. Distance learning gives a voice to those who are often overlooked and forgotten, and gives them a way to better themselves and succeed. Though not without it's flaws, distance learning can be very beneficial to students taking classes from home. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. I believe that if driverless cars became legal more accidents would occur and thousands of perople lose their jobs.

Driverless cars have almost every part of the car controlled by a computer. So, what happens if the car's computer lost power because it has been on to long, or it overheats because the computer is working to hard? In all these situations the car would most likely stop functioning correctly , and quite possibly hurt a pasenger. What if an essential part of the car breaks while on the road? The google car has a special piece of equipment called a LIDAR that keeps a constant 3-D model of the area around. If that piece of machinery fails while on the road the driver is required to take control of the car to keep it from driving into any people, buildings, or other cars. In all of the situations above the driver would need to take control of that unique situation, or else fatalities could occur. These are only a couple examples of what could happen if a driverless car malfunctioned while on the road.

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars. this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and Uber drivers out of a job. There are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars. A job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway, and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash. Emergerency response vehicles like ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly, efficiantly, and safely. These examples show that hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs if driverless cars were to take over. They also show that some jobs can not be completed without a driver behind the wheel.

Since, driverless cars are driven by computers that means they are suseptable to hackers or other harmful people. If a driverless car has a computer that is connected to the internet hackers anywhere in the world could hack into the car's computer, and make it do whatever they want. There are also people who could damage the car physically by damaging essential external parts of the car. There are also unforseen events that could happen through nature. The car's camera or LIDAR could be covered up acciddently by a leaf or a bug. The car could hit a bad bump and jar the sytems computer. These are things that are possible in the realm of driverless cars.

These reasons that I have stated show that there will always be a time when cars will need a driver to take control of a unique situation. Whether it be a faulty computer or broken camera; drivers will always be needed.  ",0,persuade_corpus,1

Dear TEACHER_NAME;

Many students argue that community service is nothing that requires them, but many adults and some students feel it is an important part of our world, and it's an activity that everyone can participate in. Everyone needs to help change the world, and I agree that community service is a big deed that students should be taking a part of, but a lot of students claim they don't have enough time. Doing little things like walking your neighbors dog, or help babysit your cousins is enough for students who have extracurricular activities, and boat loads of homework. Many students do participate in community service, and many also do extracurricular activities.

The main reason students say that they cannot participate in community services is because they play sports, or are on the dance team, or in English festival. They participate in something extracurricular, therefore they don't have the time between games and practices to balance out there schedule and their grades.

The students grades are another important reason to either decide if or if you cannot participate in community services, let alone extracurricular activities. I think if there is a student or students who do not participate in any extra activities, and keep there grades up, I think they can be a part of community services, as well as other students who participate in the activities, outside of school hours. I think the school should have a sign up sheet which requires every student to sign up for a community service. Now, not all community services are giving away food to the homeless, it's a simple thing such as tutoring a younger student, or cleaning up the lunchroom so all the volunteers who prepared the lunch don't have another burden on their shoulders.

I think all students should do something for the community not just at home, but maybe the school can volunteer and help with the community service. Every student should do at least 2 community services. Maybe one at home and one at school. Just because some kids are complaining that they have to much homework or to many practices doesn't mean that they can't throw in a little extra time for the community. Go to study hall or try to get some of your work done in school, instead of talking. If you are struggling with school work, then try to focus on that and then go towards the community services once your ready and caught up with school work.

Now my opinion is that all students should participate in some sort of community services and still be able to balance out there grades and conflicting schedules. Everyone needs to be flexible, and try to help out the community for a change. It should be required, and every student should be able to handle a little community services. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,

"Driving can be extremely dangerous for you or anyone else, especially if you're not careful and focused. While driving you must be sure that your taking every precaution you can to maintain safety for yourself and others as well. Many people believe that the use of cell phones can be very hazardous, and I strongly agree with that statement for many reasons. Cell phones have caused fatal wrecks that lead to either death or serious injury. For example, ""an article published by Tony Long states that he was almost killed on his motorcycle while trying to avoid being hit by a reckless driver who was on the phone."" The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle isn't the most ideal or realistic to ensure your safety as well as others safety.

Cell phones cause late reactions, especially for those that are being held in the driver's hand. Majority of people have a habit of allowing their cell phone to influence their reflexes and reactions to certain death-defying situations. One of my resources states, ""Not only are 27 percent of all automobile accidents believed to result from talking or texting while driving, but smartphone use has also been implicated in several recent rail disasters as well."" The use of cell phones while driving a vehicle is just as dangerous as drunk driving, maybe even worse because studies shown that, ""texting and driving slows the reaction time more than being drunk"". Meaning that using a phone while under the wheel can alter a driver's reaction time on the road because your focusing on two things at once, although all your attention should be towards driving and driving only.

Even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. The National Safety Council reports that, ""answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field."" Anything can happen while you're driving, such as: a car could hit their brakes in front of you, a car could be merging into your lane, traffic might be coming up, or something might jump out into the road. Therefore, you need to keep your eyes on the road at all times with your hands free of anything other than the steering wheel.

It is statistically proven that the cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes with nearly 390,000 injuries each year. Even with those high numbers, people still choose to be on a cell phone while managing with a vehicle on the road. Some people believe that it is safe to use a phone while driving, or that ""nothing will happen to them"". In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents and 15,341 that were aged between 15 and 29 were involved in fatal crashes while driving with a cell phone in hand. Therefore, some people may believe that using a cell phone while driving isn't dangerous, but the facts say otherwise.

In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.            ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The advantages in limiting car usage in Germany is to not buy one. Heidrun Walter said, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm way much happier this way."" From people not driving cars, it reduces the greenhouse gas emissons. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percenet of the greenhouse gas emissons in Europe, and 50 percent in the United States. From people not using vehicles, and walk or ride bicycles instead, they tend to take the suburbs to get around. The suburbs are more compact and more accessible to the public than your own personal car. Now that they have taken away personal vehicles and gave them suburbs, the stores are a walk away on the main street, other than a walk on a distant highway. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency promoted ""car reduced communities.""

While in Paris, they banned driving because of the smog. On Mondays, vehicles with even-numbered license plates were told to leave their vehicles at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same thing with the odd numbered license plates the next day. Almost 4,000 of the drivers were fined because they didn't follow the rules and their cars got impounded. The cold nights and warm days caused the smog to form which made a thick layer of air to trap the car emissions. Diesel fuel is the biggest issue because it makes up 67 percent of the vehicles in France compaired to 53.3 percent in Western Europe. When the smog cleared up on Monday, the French party went after the odd-numbered licensed plates on Tuesday and fined them.

In Bogota, Columbia there is a program that was sent to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses, left the city and avoided the traffic jams. Cars have been banned to the point were people can ride buses and be taxed with the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. Their goal is to promote the transportation and reduce the smog. For the first time, two other Columbian cities joined the event. The parks and sport centers were fixed throughout the city. The uneven sidewalks have been replaced, rush hour restrictions have cut traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas have cropped up.

The end of car culture is president Obama's goals are to change the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go on. Mr. Sivak said that when he was in his late 20s early 30s, he was curious about what kind of car he drove, but no one really cared as long as it got you from point A to point B. A study was done last year and it stated that young drivers decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. At the Mobile World Congress last year in Bill Ford, Barcelona and Spain, the For Motor Companys chairman laid the business plan out for the world to see. He said to create the cities so the pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, and other transportation are brought into a connected network to save time, conserve recoursces lower the emissions and to improve the safety.

"Dear Principal,

I think that if the principal is going to do this then the school will not have a team she might have a average of five people on a team. If she goes to another school and look at the students that make the lowest of a C and no lower or they are off the team. She would find that they have a lot more student on their team then her school. If she would ask all the team who as made a C. A average of half the team would say they do. Most schools that have a sports teams if you make a D you will be kicked off the team. I know this because i am on a sports team i have to keep my grades up or i am off the team till i get that grade back up. If the rule if you make a C you are off the team was considered at my school most of my team would not be able to play.

If i was her i would not consider this rule it would make her lose most of her team it might just be one or two students but those two student could be your two best team players and the ones that make a B or A they have work ten times hard then what those other two students did. I would consider the principal to look in to how many students make C and then reconsider if she want this rule to be considered

Most of the sports players try not to get below a C or D but most students that play on a team are really trying to where some students that don't play sports don't really care about there grades. If i was her i would really look in to how many of the students that play on a sports team do make a C. Not every student is like they always make different grades. Most students try their every best to keep their grade no matter what. I say that if i was you don't change it because it will cause students that are on a sports team might lose their dream of become a sports player.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Most people you see cleaning up the community are people who have gone to jail or there told they would have to clean to do community service. Doing community service will not only help out the environment, but it helps out with the community as well.

Every kid would not want to spend there day cleaning the community, they would rather stay at home and do nothing, but not all kids are like that. Those other kids would rather help out our community than have litter everywhere an live in a garbage dump. I think it would be better if kids did help out an clean because it will give them an opportunity to give back to the community an do something right for a change. Kids who do get into trouble, this can help them to stay out of all that trouble. Cleaning up will also look good for the community, it will look more attracting and would make people want to go there. It would also help with the pollution.

Telling kids at a young age to pick up trash can help prevent this. Even though kids would rather not do community service, I think it would be good for them. Doing so, this would help the kids stay out of trouble and keep people knowing that they live in a clean community an we still have some kids helping out the community.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Summer is my favorite time of year. In the United States, schools have a little over two months break from school each year. During this period of time schools usually give students assignments to help them remember all that they have learned during the school year. It is very common for teachers and other staff to design these assignments for schools, including my own school. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because it would make it a more engaging and exciting experience for students, and it would help students be more productive over the summer.

Student-designed projects would make summer projects more engaging for students, while still expanding their knowledge. An experience I had with this was after I finished my freshman year in high school. Over the summer I had a ten page assignment for my math class that I had to finish before the first day of school started. This experience was very frustrating because all I could think about at that time was what I was missing out on with all my other summer activities. This assignment was very long and boring for me to do, when it could've been a lot more fun and exciting if students could've brought their own personal intrests and ideas into it. Another example was when my friend Generic_Name had to do an assignment for German class. The teacher asked each of the students to research one aspect of German culture and then make a power point with pictures with what they found. Although this wasn't a summer assignment it shows how assignments can be made more engaging if students can take charge in it. In this instance, Generic_Name was able to research a specific part of German culture she was interested in, and she actually enjoyed taking part in this project. Summer projects have the potential to be very engaging and could even bring in personal interest if they could be student lead.

If students were able to design their own summer assignments it would help them be more productive with their free time. In past years at my school, teachers have assigned specific assignments for the summer, but this last year they had a checklist of some educational activities one could take part in such as: watch a documentary, read a book of choice, go to a museum, and so on. I decided to go to a science museum with my family, where we learned about astronomy, oceanography, meteorology, and much more. This experience was very fun because I got to spend time with my family, but also it helped me learn even more about science, which I already love. It also helped me go outside the house and be productive with my time instead of sitting around and watching TV all day. Another time, some friends of mine told me that they don't even do the assignments until the last few days before school starts. These summer projects are not even helping the students learn if they're just rushing to finish. In this instance, the students were not even being productive with they're time because when they rushed to complete the assignment they could not comprehend what they're writing down. Summer is a time when people don't have too much going on, so it promotes laziness and procrastination, but with an interesting assignment it could bring students off the couch.

Some may disagree and say that teachers should design these summer assignments. Although it is understandable to think this way, this reasoning is flawed because teacher-designed projects don't always connect with the students. One example I have of this was with our summer reading book from last summer, 'Craig and Fred.' This novel was about a marine in Iran who found a dog and brought him back home even though it was against the military rules. I thought the book was very well written, and I appreciated this experience Craig shared with us, but I personally didn't connect with the story because I couldn't relate to the characters in the book and it wasn't a kind of book I usually read. When teachers give these kind of assignments it's hard to relate and have a good experience doing them. Bad feelings toward summer projects could be entirely avoided if students were able to choose their own book or even put in suggestions for them. I've had so many experiences in high school where I just didn't connect with or completely understand an assignment, and has resulted in it being very hard to complete. Some teachers can come up with fun activities for projects, but it would help students overall if they could have input in their projects.

It is important to remember that school is not made to stress students out with all the tests and assignments teachers give them, it is to help students learn all about the world and prepare us for real life. In the past teachers have planned out these projects for the summer, but I believe in the future that should change because it can help students see how things they've learned in school work in the outside world. So teachers, let students take charge for once!",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" stated that meeting the challenge of exploring Venus is valuable because it will provide more knowledge of the planet, but also because humans will be curious about many dangerous things in the future. The author stated many dangers and doubts of exploring the planet, but then described solutions that may or may not work. It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements. The author created confusion to what he actually believes.

The author of the article described Venus as Earth's ""twin."" That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's ""twin,"" doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth. The author needed to be clearer on which way he wanted people to view that statement.

The author also brought up the dangers of visiting Venus multiple times. Then, he would proceed to follow the statement with tested and untested solutions. It was hard to tell which way he sided. According to the author, ""Venusian geolegy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes..."" He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground. In order to get his point across to the audience, he should not have kept going agianst information.

The author went off topic throughout the article. The different information created slight confusion as to what the message he was trying to convey. The author stated that NASA is working on an approach to studying Venus that involves mechanical computers. He then said, ""The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers..."" It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support.

The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored. Also, it would have been easier to understand the point he was trying to put across if he would have stayed on topic throughout the article. The message of the article should be obviously supported by the author.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever gotten an opinion, but then went to ask someone else? It's logical to want a bigger sample size and have more people confirm your thoughts. It can even go too far as once you get enough of the same response, it becomes the only right idea in your mind. However there are many benefits of asking multiple people, the experience they bring could be invaluable, people with different relations to you can let you see in new ways, and beliefs are always good to consider with the facts.

First off, you have to consider their experience. Asking someone who read an article once three years ago likely won't have great ideas to share. If you ask someone with a P.H.D in the topic, you are probably going to get a better answer and gain more information overall. Be careful though, many people act like they know lots about something even when they have no clue about the topic.

Secondly, you must think about the relation they have to you. Asking your family will probably get you a more conservative opinion thinking about safety. Asking someone who you have been in conflict with many times will likely give an answer that is worse than your current idea. So try asking people you know well and trust enough to give more helpful input. This isn't to say you should never ask your family or someone you fight with, just make sure you are getting helpful responses.

Lastly whenever you take an opinion into account, think about who said it and their natural beliefs and bias. Taking any opinion at face value can be detrimental and maybe even dangerous. If you ask a religious person and an atheist, they might have different opinions. As will an American and a Italian or even the President and a teacher. Everyone has some bias and beliefs they hold close so make sure to think about what bias they might have and for why they gave that answer!

So overall, just think about their knowledge on the topic, what feelings they may have towards you, and their bias. Make sure they know what they are talking about and not just saying stuff they made up on the spot. Think about how your relation may impact how they answer. Most importantly, consider their bias and reason for telling you what they told you. We have to make sure people get second opinions but more importantly, think about the response and not just accept it!",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Many places around the world are limiting the usage of cars. If more places created regulations like these, it may drastically change the environment, for the better.

Vauban, a suburb in Germany, made conditions in the neighborhood almost impossible to own a car. While it may seem like an annoyance, many of the residents are happier this way. According to Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" While many people may see having to give up or not use their can an annoyance, if they get used to it they might find that not using their cars may be a good thing.

Instead of having to hear car engines and honking horns, they can take a relaxing walk or even a bike ride somewhere.

Limiting car usage would also be very helpful in cleaning up the environment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" the author states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States."" Limiting the amount people can drive their cars could reduce a hefty amount of pollution in our air. In France, they limitied the amount of people who were allowed to drive for two days. Paris has more pollution in their air then most European cities, but putting regulations on who could drive significantly reduced the amount of smog in just a few days, according to Robert Duffer.

Putting regulations on car usage can also make the area you live in a much nicer place. In Colombia, a few cities have an annual ""Day Without Cars"", where citizens are fined for using their cars. As a result, things like restaurants and malls have been being built. They are repairing more sidewalks and building new bicycle paths. Parks are being used more often. The communities would be much nicer places with out the frequent use of cars.

Limiting the use of cars is a very good thing. It helps the environment, and it helps make the world a nicer place.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" I say the author makes good points for both sides. I would say he is going with it would not be a very good idea to try an explore Venus.

He says "" A thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". This is one reason it would be very hard to explore Veuns. Also becuase on the surface of Venuse the temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit.""the pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet"". This is saying that this enviroment would crush a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans on earth. Also venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our sorlar system. With it being that hot it would liquify the metals we have on earth. This is why I think that the mission or challenges needed done to get to Venus are not worth the risks of loseing money or more importantly the lives of good people on this earth.

In conclusion the fight to see whats on Venus is not worth it. They have no way to even set foot on this planet. They would imeditaly be either crushed by the 90 time greater pressure than we exsperince. Or die to the 800 degrees fahrenheit that the planet has to offer.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"To many students, extracurricular activities are the highlight of their school day. It lets them connect with their friends and meet new people. However, some students prefer to abstain from these forms of activities, as it may not completely align with the interests that they perceive. It is not fair to mandate extracurricular activities to students, as it invalidates a student's ability to choose what they do in their day-to-day life, and that not all students enjoy extracurricular activities. Schools have no jurisdiction in forcing children to participate in after-school activities, as they don't correspond with the academic goals of all students.

A large amount of students tend to stray away from extracurricular activities for a variety of reasons. They may not be interested in the roster of groups to join. They may prefer to be alone and work better as such. Schools have no authority to impede on the overall goals of an individual. It is the student's (and their family's) choice in what they are truly mandated to do. It is inhumane to take away one's right to choose their path they will follow. It is simply disgusting to impede on a child's right to make their own friends, and follow their own passions; passions that may not be included in a roster for after school groups. It is not fair as not all students enjoy participating in extracurricular activities.

We cannot generalize how much students enjoy after school activities. People have different preferences, and should be respected as such. The Board of Education has no right to mandate extracurricular activities, as they are not directly part of any academic subject. While they are in schools, they are separate entities and made to be optional, hence the name, ""extracurricular"". Not all students enjoy participating in these clubs and could overall hurt them many social aspects (e. g. forcing them into uncomfortable environments). In truth, many students enjoy not participating in extracurricular activities. What a child is mandated to do, that is not part of any academic institution, is up to the parents/guardians of said student.

In conclusion, schools don't attain authority to force people into groups and clubs. Especially they make it a required for academic success. This stretch of power impedes on a student's right to choose who they want to be, and what they want to do with their childhood. It invalidates students who don't enjoy an excess of social interaction. In truth, it is not up to schools to choose the path a student takes, but the student themselves.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do not think that community service should be required in school. Even though it is a great way to meet new people and is a very honourable action, some students just do not have the time to do things like that.

We as students are given many projects and a plethora of homework, not to mention studying for tests, to add community service as a requirement would nearly be a crime. Personally I think that community service is a great thing to do, but as a hobby not a requirement. If you where to add community service as a requirement I assure you that a lot of grade A students will be retained for not participating. I alone sometimes feel overwhelmed by the various work assignments that I receive at school, and I usually get an A or a B, but if I had to work community service as well i would become too over worked and start on a steep downward slope in my grades.

If you made community service as a way to get high school credits however, I think that everyone will be very happy. You will get to brag to the school board that your students participate in community service, and the over worked students will be able to do community service when their schedule clears up.

You have now read my argument and resolution, so the final decision is up to you, and I hope that you take what I have written into consideration. Goodbye.

"Students in the modern day classroom have a lot of problems , whether that be Mental illness affecting them or just work that is just piling up from sick days. Some students just cant keep up and some have even dropped out because of it. Therefore I wanted to address something , should students be able to take video classes from home ? Yes and here are the reasons why .

Many students in the modern day classroom have many things that can make their school work quantity and quality decline. For instance many students are Anti Social , this means a couple things . It could just be they don like interactions with other people , or they could fear social interaction and it causes great stress upon them. I propose this , we should give students that have this another option. We could have them take online classes. I know this deviates from school norms , but please just ponder this for a moment , isnt school supposed to be about learning. Yes yes it is and so what if that means that some students learn better from home. Who are we to deny them the right to learn where they feel comfortable. It just makes sense , let them learn how they do best and offer them options. That way our scores can go up and students wouldnt have to be stressed all the time. We should see this as a win for the schools and a win for the students.

The next point I would like to make is , that online video classes could allow students who have to work to finish their education even if they might be forced out of the school to provide for a family or any other reason that requires a student to work. This can and will be a major advantage to these students and should be implemented soon and very soon , But of course this dose not only benefit the students it also benefits the schools. Ponder this if schools get funding based on how good the students test scores are , why wouldnt the school provide them a service that could help keep scores up . Then the schools would get more funding and many more students could graduate with a chance to earn higher incomes all because they got their high school diploma. I see this as not just a win for the schools or students but for everyone including the country's economy.

Furthermore students during a school year can suffer from a variety of illnesses ranging from the Flu to mental illnesses , and this may require them to take some time off. Sometimes the days off can range from 3-14 days off. This is a lot of school time that cannot really be caught up with in class. Sure you can learn the concepts from youre work , but what if the teacher taught some kind of method to help but dose'nt include them in the work. This is what online video classes would solve and eventually put an end to. Students from their own home could while they are in bed take notes from the class the day before or even that very days class. This is a huge help to every sick student and need I say it again should be implemented very very soon.

As we all know some students just dont work well in a modern classroom environment whether it be from the reasons above or not. Maybe they could have ADHD or ADD but that dosent matter. They should still receive an education like everyone else , and should they find that they dont really work well in a modern classroom then schools should offer them an out that will help them out , the same goes with people with ADD. People with anger issues could also reap he rewards from these classes too , maybe they get irritated easily and are prone to lashing out . In that case maybe they might learn better from home while they work with a professional to learn how to conquer their anger and maybe if they feel like they can handle it . They could resume in class school and just go about the rest of their time there and it could be like they never left.

Now before I end my discussion about this subject , I would like to introduce a counter argument that many may have on the issue of online classes. A lot of people seem to think that students are just lazy , and if offered online classes they will just skip them and not do them. I would like to dash this misconception right now. Most students are not lazy in fact most of the hardest working people I know are students and trust me they work hard. Most of us in fact are just stressed as I mentioned before. We may just seem slow and unmotivated but thats just the stress from school showing , but trust me all that slow movement and everything will change once we get around our friends or once we start doing the things we love. whether that be playing video games to writing or maybe even off road racing. But please remember not all of us are lazy , but im not saying some of us arent lazy we all have our moments , after all we are human beings.

In conclusion these classes would help everyone regardless of them being lazy and just wanting to stay home. We also have to remember that some students just cant bring themselves to get out of bed much less the house possibly to do with mental illness or sickness , but what ever the case the school should respect that and these online classes would still make sure they get the education they need to succeed in life. The workers could also focus more on making money and less on the struggles brought about by school as work is enough stress already. We cant forget about those students who dont work well in classrooms , it helps them just as much as the rest of us. As we can see from my arguments above the numerous advantages far outnumber the disadvantages of online video classes. I highly encourage schools to implement this alternative method of teaching to greatly improve the classroom environment. Also if the schools play their cards right they may even earn higher test scores and more and more funding to help rebuild anything the schools need repaired or maybe even provide more programs to help students. I now rest my case as to why I feel online video classes should be allowed good day.                     ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Principal,

Changing the new grade policy for sports and other school activities is not a good idea in my opinion. Right now many students have a grade C average. If you change the policy to a grade B average many student will be upset.

A lot of the student athletes work hard in school and sports. Some however may not be the best in school but they still can obtain a grade C average.

Many athletes will be very upset if they can not participate in their sports. If the policy is changed these student athletes will have a lot of stress trying to obtain a grade B average and wont be able to focus on their actual sport. Also many other students will be upset if they do other school activities and cant go to them without a grade B average. I and many other students can agree that changing the grade policy for sports and other activities is not a very wise idea.

Sincerely,

"You've probably heard the saying, ""Try new things."" You may be tired of hearing it, but it's actually a good thing to do. Being in extracurricular activities is a way to try new things that you might not have known you like. I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you can explore something you haven't before, you can make friends, and you might find that it's something you enjoy.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allows you to explore different options that you haven't before. Trying new things is a good way to see what you like and dislike. You could realize that you love to play sports through extracurricular activities. You could also gain experience. Having experience in different fields can be helpful for academic and life purposes. Participating in an extracurricular activity might be helpful for the future. It could help with getting a job and it could end up being your career path. Getting the opportunity to explore new things is a reason you should participate in extracurricular activities.

Making friends is also a bonus when you are in an activity. You can find people with similar interests as you. Starting conversations with others is easier if you're in the same activity as them. You could have fun while participating with others. Doing things with other people can make you enjoy the activity more. Participating is also an opportunity for you to meet new people you wouldn't have known if you weren't in an extracurricular activity. You could make long lasting friendships you wouldn't have made if you didn't participate. Being in an extracurricular activity is a fun way to make new friends.

The downside is that you would be forced to be in an activity. If you are forced to do something, it can make the activity less fun. However, you could find that the activity is something you really like to do. You can find out new things about yourself or find a new hobby. Extracurricular activities are outlets for you to find new things that you enjoy.

I think that students should participate in an extracurricular activity. You get to explore different things, you can make new friends, and you could find that the activity you're in is something you like to do. Even though you would be forced to participate, extracurricular activities are something everyone can enjoy.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In the current era, you never have to step foot in a public school ever again. Yes, you are still lawfully required to complete the majority of your secondary education, but the ever growing access to laptops and other electronic devices has introduced a new method for students to earn their highschool diplomas. Some school districts now permit their students to learn and participate in class via internet or video conference. While this innovation may seem like a peek into the future of American schools, it is not without its share of faults. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in typically absent-causing.

After every school year, students are expected to show mastery of the cirriculums in each of their core classes. What the final exams fail to measure, however, are the other critical life skills that students obtain in the classroom. For example, group projects do more for the individual than teach them a bunch of facts and figures. They also simulate the level of collaboration students will use regularly as future members of the workforce. Similarly, assigning nightly homework goes deeper than the teacher's desire to keep their pupils busy, as learning to balance piles of graded assignments is an effective way to teach lessons about time management. Taking online classes will enact these same skills to an extent, though the lack of classmates combined with a more flexible schedule puts students in a bit of a bubble. In other words, school becomes less about practical application and focuses significantly more on pure academic knowledge. While online classes accomplish the same goal in their cirriculums, they fall terribly short in teaching students other important life skills.

social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to ""quiet down"" and ""focus on their assignments"", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers. Online classes, with their isolated environment, cause students to lack the same interaction and attention they recieve at school everyday.

Of course, schools would not offer their students online classes if it came with zero benefits. There is a strong arguement to be made in favor of virtual schooling when students are abesent for an extended period of time. When faced with extreme situations, like severe illness or family emergencies, students must also stress over catching up on their work upon returning to school. Online classes would allow these students to complete assignments and learn course material outside of the classroom. Nonetheless, this peace of mind is only applicable if the student is mentally and/or physically capable to do schoolwork while enduring such a taxing hardship. Online classes may come in handy when students would usually miss school, even the pros are of this school system are laced with cons.

The debate of online classes in place of traditional schooling is a complicated one. Allowing students to complete their academic career without actually attending school may help keep them on track, as they could continue to learn in situations that would otherwise require an absence, but at what price? Online classes cause students to miss out on important life lessons and practical skills, such as collaboration and time management, due the the structure of the assignments. Additionally, students will have less opportunites to interact with their peers and create long-lasting memories at school-sponsered events. For now, it is in the best interest of the children and the future society to keep students in the classroom. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in absent-causing situations. ",0,persuade_corpus,2

"Phones & Driving

Bologna and cheese! Pepperoni and pizza! Peanut butter and jelly! These are all things that go together. What doesn't go together it's texting and driving. Cell phones have become so commonplace that people don't see how much of a danger they can be. Cell phone use should not be permitted while driving. Cell phones should be stored away/out of reach while driving a vehicle. Some of the reasons cell phones shouldn't be allowed while driving include distraction for the driver, leading to increased deaths or increase accidents.

Distracted driving accounts for approximately ""25%"" of all motor vehicle fatalities according to the website Teensafe. com. Teens make up the largest group of distracted drivers. Because of their inexperience accidents involving teen could most likely involve in death. Cell phones are a major cause of distracted driving resulting in more than 400,000 injuries and 4,000 deaths each year according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (www. geotab. com) Drivers can also get distracted by eating or drinking, worrying about the radio, reading directions, talking/texting( anything that has to deal with cell phone use.)

Road rage also accumulates with cell phone use because being on the phone while not paying 100% to the road could lead to accidents which could lead to a road rage between drivers. 50% becomes aggressors due to the driving habits of others. Unsafe lane changing because of drivers being on their cell phones. People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into accidents than those who drive while intoxicated. More than half of drivers will experience road rage in their life.

There are those who will argue that cell phones aren't any better than any other distractions such as playing with the radio or looking for something in the car while on the road. Both distracted drivers and road rage are common to each other. Road rage is apart of cell phone use just like distractions during driving in an vehicle. Use of cell phone can take an individuals eye's off the road for anywhere from 30 secs to 1 minute whic can result in road rage from cars close by the driver who is distracted. Cell phone use is a part of distractions for drivers which can cause road rage and an conflict between drivers.

Cell phone use while driving is a major distraction which can result in road rage and/or an accident. For many reasons cell phones and driving do not go together. Drivers need to be focused and alert while on the road. Drivers lose focus when they are worried about answering their phone while on the road. Phones while driving are hazardous for everyone.

"It is the most anticipated time of the year for any student. After a long and hard-earned year, summer break has finally arrived. Although summer break is a break from school, it is not a break from learning. To insure that learning continues, many schools require students to do a project over the break. This has sparked debate over whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it would cause students to become more enthusiastic about it, students would be more likely to complete them, and it would not take away as much from the students' summer as it would if it were teacher-designed.

One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because it would cause the students to become more enthusiastic about it. Most students would not be very pleased when finding out that they have been tasked with a project during the summer. This displeasure would grow even more if the project was teacher-designed and containing a topic of which they hold no interest in. This would result in the students doing the projects just to do them and obtaining little to no knowledge while doing so. However, if the project was student-designed, the students would be able to pick a topic they are interested in and passionate about. This would cause them to become more enthusiastic about it, and maybe might even make the students happy and excited about doing it. Because they would have enthusiasm while doing it, they would also retain a lot more knowledge and information from it making it much more beneficial and better achieving the assignment's purpose. In the end, summer projects should be student-designed, because it would cause students to become more enthusiastic about it.

Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students would be more likely to complete it. When assigned with unwanted work, many students divert to the option of just not doing it. Not only does this defeat the purpose of the assignment because the students will not learn anything, it also puts these students at a disadvantage to those who did, and gives them a bad grade to start off with before school even starts. However, if the students get to design the project and pick a subject or topic they would like to do, it would make them much more likely to complete it. For example, a lot of the reason why many of these students do not complete their work is because they have other interests that they prioritize over school. However, if they were able to design and conduct an experiment concerning one of these interests, they would be much more motivated to get it done. In the end, summer projects should be student-designed, because students would be more likely to do them.

The last reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because it would not take away as much from the students' summer as it would if it were teacher-designed. There is summer break for a reason, and that is it is much needed as a school year is long, draining, and full of ups and downs. Summer break should be a time of fun, relaxation, and vacations, and for many, may include other tasks such as sports and summer jobs. A summer project can take away from these things, especially if it is teacher-designed. Many students even feel burdened by the idea of knowing it has to be done, and therefore causes them to stress about it. If the project was student-designed, however, the taking away of summer time would be shrunken to a minimum. This is because the students can do a project that fits their location, amount of time, and interests. A student may not be able to fulfill a teacher-designed experiment, because they simply do not have time to do so. For example, a student who vacations a lot during the summer, may not be able to do a teacher-designed experiment which involves measuring plant growth over time, which requires a lot of time, and may only produce valid results if they were grown in one location. To do this, the student may have to cancel a trip, which should never have to happen. If the project were student-designed however, the student could do an experiment based off of their travels, perhaps collecting and comparing data from the places they travel. Not only would this be interesting and unique, it would also be very knowledgeable, and most importantly not impede in the way of the trips the student takes. In the end, summer projects should be student-designed, because it would not take away as much from the students' summer as it would if it were teacher-designed.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed, because it would cause the students to become more enthusiastic about it, students would be more likely to complete them, and it would not take away as much from the students' summer as it would if it were teacher-designed. Although student projects can be viewed as beneficial and necessary, it is ultimately up to the student to fulfill its purpose. Therefore, the best way to get students to achieve the goal of continuing to learn over their break, and at the same time to respect their break time, is to make the projects student-designed. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

I and the other students appreciate your reviewing of our school's cell phone polices, but I do not support allowing students to use cell phones during lunch and other free periods during the school day. Most students at our school do own a cell phone and carry it with them on an average school day. I do acknowledge that many students are in support of allowing cell phones to be permitted during certain times during school, but I strongly disagree.

There are several important reasons why cell phones are not allowed to be used during school. If the students are given the ability to use their phones at some parts of the day they will be tempted to use them all day.

If students know they will be allowed to use their phone during lunch and their free period, what stops them from using them in the classroom during crucial learning time for students? Suppose that during class students are texting and their cell phone's ring tone goes off while their teacher is teaching the class academic lesson.

Or Imagine students taking an important test in a classroom. A student can easily take their phone and send a text message of the answers to another student. It's that simple for students to do when a teacher steps away for a moment or turns around.

Put yourself in a gym locker room. When students are changing another student has the chance to take a photo of another student and post it somewhere on the internet.

I must stress that when the students attending school here know they will be allowed to have their phones turned on during parts of the day, there will be students who refuse to follow guidelines and rules for when the phones should be turned on and off. These problems created from allowing cell phones are an example of what could become a reality for our school.

I reassure you that prohibiting cell phones from being used in school is a rule that has been upheld with good reasoning and logic.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable to help students understand if they are confused or bored.

In paragraph six Dr. Huang states that the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This is would be a great thing to put on our classroom computers because for one the students would not have to sit there becoming confused, if the computer modifies the lesson for the student so they could best understand it, it would be so helpfull.

Also if we but this on the computers at school it would help the teachers so much they would not have to go from student to student, they could just let the computers help the students with the lesson wile the teach can grade assessments and other work. I know for one that when I need help can sometimes take my teacher quite awhile to get to me, if the schools had this technology in their classrooms it would be so much easier for everyone.

In paragraph 3 Dr. Paul Eckman classifies six emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. If the computers can read the emotions that a student is feeling it could help them. For example, students can have a bad day at school if the software can identify what they are feeling it could quite possibly help them with thier problems, then alot more students could be happy.

Another reason is students can be lazy if they do not know how to do something normaly they just do not do it. Going back to what Dr. Huang said in paragraph six he stated that the computer could motify the lesson if the student is bored or confused, if it can do that then it can help the student understand what to do then they won't just skip over it and not do it.

In my school there are dissabled students. If the computer program could help them understand the lesson it would be so helpfull to the teachers and to them.

So overall I think we should have this technology in schools it would be so helpfull to everyone in the school in their work and possibly in their life.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"IN the Article ""Making Mona LIsa Smile"", the auther describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables ccomputers to identify human emotions like the Mona Lisa Smile.

Well the whole process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of all faces; all 44 major musals in the model must move like human muscels. Movement of one or more muscels is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, Creator of FACS. Eckman has classifed six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles .Here is a example in the article 1. Raise your lips at the corner of your mouth.

2. Than Squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the corner of your eyes.

3 Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes.

According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emoton, moving your facial muscels not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

"Technology Getting Smarter

As humans, some of us may not realize how smart technology is really getting. The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify different types human emotions. Think about how this new kind of technology could change the world. This Facial Action Coding System could be incredibly valuable by reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

In the article D'Alto states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson.."" With this technology students may be able to understand lessons more quickly and easily. This coding system could also help more troubling students excel in the classroom while saving the teachers time. By modifying the lesson, the Facial Coding System would also keep the attention of learners. This could train students to become exception learners as they grow.

In paragraph eight of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how the muscles in the face change according to your mood. It also states ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major muscle..and the risorius."" This tells the reader that this facial coding system is accurate on its reading by reading every single muscle on the face and correlating it to different moods. Because this technology is accurate, there may be little to no mistakes in reading a student's face in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System could change how students would learn. This technology would help students excel and grow to become more intelligent individuals. This could help the following generations behind us smarter and more understanding. This facial coding system can help students achieve their learning goals in the classroom. This new technology would be valuable in the classroom for students.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Many people thought that the face on Mars was created by aliens. I do not agree with that statement because there is no evidence supporting that theory. However, there is evidence supporting that the face is merely a landform that was created naturally. Throughout the article, it shares ideas from NASA, which is the foundation that discovered the face on Mars in the first place.

The first statement that the article makes about the face being a natural landform is, ""New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" This one statement shows that NASA, one of the biggest names in space industry, believes the face is only a mesa. The people back in the Jet Propulsion Lab must have been surprised to see such a startling sight, but luckily NASA provides more information to show that the face is only a simple landform.

The text provides a caption from the message unveiled by NASA. The caption states, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This exact caption says the exact proof that the face is clearly just a rock formation. Every person should already know how shadows can, well, cast shadows that may give illusions of other objects.

Some people that believe in aliens may say that it would be crazy to think that a rock formation and shadows could form the illusion of a face, but I've seen shadows that are casted when the sun hits them just right. Isn't it completely logical that the sun could hit the shadows to fill the holes in the rocks? I sure believe so.

The last quote I would like to give as my evidence is, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you couold see what they were!"" This single statement shows that the cameras they were using to the maximum resolution, would in fact show if there was actually an alien artifact on the planet. But the strongest possible photo showed no ancient alien artifacts. It only showed a natural rock formation with shadows that formed what appeared to be a face.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Last summer, I attended an online class for Algebra II, and the experiences were somewhat horrible. I wasn't be able to focus in the class or communicate with my classmates. Sometimes, I planned to ask my teacher about a math problem, but I always missed the teacher's video call. Since I thought I had a lot of free time, I often woke up late to attend the class. Therefore, my grades were affected, and I learned less from the online class. Online school has a lot of downsides and negatives that would ruin a student's focus, self-discipline, and communication. Because of the negative impacts that could happen to students, I won't recommend attending classes from home.

Students who lose focus in class might result in failing a test or quiz. There are a lot of ways for a person to lose their attentions on online class. One of the examples is that their family members could distract them from studying. Students who have poor time management, such as those who wake up late for online schools, would miss their lessons. Furthermore, some of the devices that often grab their attention away are phones and games. Especially, when the teacher isn't monitoring the students; they would do anything they please. As the students lose their focus, they wouldn't remember the teacher's lessons. This negative result could affect the students' test and quiz scores and grades.

Most schools often teach students self-disciplines aside from their family. For instant, they taught students to be respectful with their classmates and teachers. Another important lesson is that students should maintain a good behavior around their peers. Students who attend classes from home would miss the opportunities to learn self-disciplines. The evidence to prove the message is clear, most teachers wouldn't invest their time and energy on students who they barely know or meet. Therefore, no one would teach the students, whom study at home, on basic manners and self-disciplines.

As a method of teaching in Vietnam used to say ""one should learn self-disciplines first before learning other things."" Self-discipline is a significant, critical characteristic that is needed in the real world. Without it, one wouldn't be able to get a job, an interview, or become successful.

Communication plays a major role in our daily lives; it is a major tool to express our feelings with people around us. Nevertheless, distance learning that some schools offer could ruin students' communication skill. Imagine a class where the only way students could have a conversation with their peers and teachers is through a screen. By doing so, some people who attend online classes would have a diffcult time communicating with others. They are used to speak through their computers instead of holding a real conversation, a face to face one. Their face expressions would also be affected by this situation. When typing through a screen, one wouldn't have to show much expressions, however, it would be different to a real conversation. Most students, who attend classes at home, could have less expressions and emotions on their faces due to this.

In brief, online classes have a lot of negative impacts to on the students' self-disciplines, focus, and communication skills. There are no good benefits in attending classes from home. Therefore, schools shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students.       ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The presidential election is an enourmous event that almost all Americans over the age of eighteen participate in.  But there is one problem, the system we use for it is outdated, unfair, and just terrible!  The electoral college needs to be removed because voters need more power, and there are tons of problems that come with the electoral college.

There are some pretty solid defenses for the United States to keep the electoral college.  For example, as stated in in the article by Posner, even though some candidates can dominate regions, ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""  But the thing is, even though it might not be enough to win the election, it extremely benefits the candidates race.  Another defense states in Posner's article is that the trust of the slate of electors that you are actually voting for is ""rarely betrayed.""  This is a flawed defense because it shouldn't be rarely betrayed, instead, it shouldn't be betrayed at all!

Since the trust of voters in the slate of electors can't be betrayed, why not put the power in the voters hands instead of people most of the voters have never even met?  The voters aren't even voting for the president in the electoral college system, they are voting for a slate of electors.  And in the text written by Plumer, that the voters can't even control who they're voting for!  Another claim in Plumer's article to back the last sentence up is:  ""The House's selection can hadly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""  That is just ludicrous!  Also, voters quite frequently ""get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates.""

That just goes to show one of the extreme amount of problems that the electoral college system has.  As stated in Plumer's passage, one of the biggest problems the electoral college system has is that ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct electioin to the kind we have now.""  But, no one can expect them to listen because, you can clearly tell from their system that they don't care about the common voters opinion, but the direct election system does.  In Plumer's article, he loosely states that another thing that can go wrong with the system we have now is the state can possibly cheat and send two slates of electors to Congress.  It has happened before so who says it can't happen again?  ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.""(John Plumer) Having a tie is just another terrible flaw in the awful electoral college system that the United States runs today.

Most voters can't even have a say in the election if we don't stop running the electoral college system.  But, if the U.S. finally smartens up and changes, the presidential election would have much fewer problems and it would put more power in the hands of the people like a democracy should be.     ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Studies have proven that 80% of students who have been involved in a technology-enhanced class from home, have been unsuccessful. With over a million kids in the U.S, an online class or video conference is a non-beneficial program that is being varied in present time.

The belief that students who partake in online classes from home is invalid, due to the fact that students can evolve to become unproductive and unhealthy.

An online class is not being explained or brought upon the way a professional would teach it. Attending an online class can be taken advantage of and your work ethic submerges. Which is why the productiveness of students attending an online class is unsatisfactory.

Sitting at home all day can become unhealthy, mentally and physically. Without any socialization with peers or teachers, students may start to feel lonely or stressed out. Having no physical contact, students have no trusted adult for communication, which affects their mental state. Being isolated, while taking an online course, can grow anxiety and depression. As much as student can be affected mentally, they are as well affected physically. A huge percentage of students attend school and return straight home once it ends. If those students were to began online classes, they would be sitting at home all day which becomes physically unhealthy to your body. Online courses promotes laziness for students who are not active or have non-related school interest and extracurricular activities.

Many students who are responsible enough are able to manage their time and succeed with online classes. The idea that students who benefit from online classes is successful due to their independence and time management.

As students grow they become more independent of their work and time management. Since they are able to have their own time at home, they can become more trustworthy of their needs. Students grow to become their own person by prospering from online classes.

Overall, the belief that students who partake in online classes from home is invalid, due to the fact that students can evolve to become unproductive and unhealthy. Taking online classes has many disadvantages. Students are not learning in a resourceful matter and do not have a way to portray what they have learned. While they are at home with no social interactions they began to feel alone and walk down the laziness path. Students need the correct fundamentals of the education they deserve and taking online classes where students are affected is not wholesome to students.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Editor

I believe that the policy our principal is trying to make is a good idea because, if you do not put in enough time to do your homework and study for a test then why should you be able to waist valuable study time on a sport and end up with a D or an F?

Students should maintain at least a C average to be able to play sports.

If there was a kid who got a scholarship to a college for sports, which is good, but only for sports and he failed most of his classes, where would he go in life?

School is supposed to prepare you for a good future and help you make good decisions.

Also, since only a fraction of all careers are sports related and only a fraction of people will make them, a kid should have a good education.

Also, if you were just as good as a kid at, lets say basketball, but he was failing and you had an A.

Would you enjoy it if that kid got to start and you didn't?

How about if you were a straight A student, and you made High Honor Role, then the school has an awards ceremony, and you didn't get an award, but the highest scorer on the basketball team did?

I think that the principal's decision would be a good one for all the students and their futures.

"Our system of driving has been implemented for a long time now.

Driverless cars would be a huge leap in technology.

There are so many cars on the road right now that require drivers and almost next to no selfdriving cars. Sel driving cars in theory sound like a good idea, but in all reality they aren't.

The first and biggest issue is cost, the self driving car will have nearly everything our current cars have, in addition to all the high tech sensors and a very exspensive Dubbed LIDAR that uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.

Also they're talking about putting in camera's on the rearview mirrors and a camera that watched the driver.

The cost of repairs will be a a necessity because your car will have to be in working order or else it will not drive itself and you will not travel, and in this day and age you have to be able to travel.

The second issue is implementation.

How will driverless cars implement their product into the general populus?

Will there be a mix of driverless cars and driver operated cars?

If so, that sounds dangerous.

Theere is no need for drivers to be on the road with experimentall technology that is new and has never been used.

The chances of a problem or accident are enormous.

The third issue is change, drivers who use this new car will most likely feel a sense that something is missing as in they aren't doing anything like steering or breaking.

They will not be used to this and feel the need to do something that will distrract them from being alert.

Selfdriving cars will be so new and so different that many Americans will shy away because the change is too significant.

In conclusion, there is already a working system in place and to try and change that system on that big of a scale will create numerous problems that may not be solved.

The three big issues are cost, implementation, and change.

The scale at which this change would happen is just too great.

In addition it is too risky to make a slow implementation because the mix of car types would create many problems as well.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Should Schools Allow Student-Assigned or Teacher-Assigned Summer Projects?

How many times have teachers assigned summer projects, yet you only get half of the students' projects? Aren't you tired of getting only half your students' projects and having to chase students down to complete their projects. When will you learn students aren't interested in teacher-assigned projects. Why not give something else a try, like student-assigned projects. Instead of teacher-assigned summer projects, why not try student-assigned summer projects. It allows to student to be creative, work independently on projects like they will in future, and get students interested in their projects. For schools to assure students continue learning effectively over the summer they should allow summer projects to be student-assigned.

Schools allowing student-assigned summer projects allows students to design and customize their own projects to their own interest. Being able to allow students to pick a topic you're passionate about gets students interested in their summer projects. Since students are allowed to pick their own topics, the project is on something that they're interested in. Students have a chance to choose a topic they have an interest for or are passionate about. Therefore, this sets students up to become immersed in their summer projects. Student-assigned summer projects allows students to explore new topics that can spike interest for students to pursue a possible, future career path.

Having projects be student assigned allows students to work independently on projects as practice and preparation for independent study projects for college. In college student-assigned projects or independent study projects are assigned often, especially in STEM fields. To help students prepare for college, student -assigned summer projects will give them a preview as to what it is like to do an independent project. Students all ready feel high schools don't prepare them for college, but student-assigned projects can get students that needed preparation for college. Schools allowing student-assigned projects are helping their students to receive necessary preparation for college.

Some educators and students believe that teacher-assigned projects are the better choice over student-assigned projects. They think it will give more structure to the project, projects will explicitly follow the curriculum, and students will know exactly what they have to complete for the project. However, all teacher-assigned projects do is stifle creativity, lose student interest, and cause students to become more dependent on teachers for ideas. For example, whenever I have teacher-assigned projects I get excited about the project, but I forget about the rubric. Once I remember there is a rubric to be followed, all of my creative ideas for the project dissipate because they don't follow the rubric guidelines. Student-assigned projects allow for more creativity, students aren't bound by a rubric.

Schools should allow student-assigned summer projects, since it allows students to open up their minds and become creative thinkers. Teacher-assigned projects stifle the creative young minds of students. Assigning independent student projects allows students to independently explore their interest, prepare them for college, and lets students use their creative brains to learn. Student-assigned summer projects help students learn effectively over the summer break.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There is no 'community service'

without 'community.' Think about that. Sure there's more to the community than just our school, but doesn't every little bit count?

There really are more important things to do than just sit around watching TV all day. What about all those children? Not the ones with all the new clothes, or the ones with the huge allowance. I mean the ones with nothing. The ones in which the only meal they eat is at school because a classmate offers them a little something. Those are the ones that need OUR help. They're not just in Haiti or Africa. They're right here in this very town, some even in this school.

Community service is simple. It can just be organizing a canned food drive and having each kid bring a little something in. We don't need to go all out. They say a little goes a long way. We all put in a little bit and before you know, we'll have enough to feed a nation. Or maybe just the kids in our town, but still, you get my point.

Community service should be necessary. There's nothing wrong with it.

You give a little time, get a little joy. It's a win win situation for everyone. Let's go out there and do something.

Lending a hand is all it takes. Just help the other students to understand that. We don't have to go and build a whole school in Africa, we just need to do SOMETHING. That something could simply be picking up litter or maybe helping a neighbor with some yard work. We just need to get involved.

All I ask that you think this over with an open mind. Sure kids have homework that they say they need to get done, but they don't do it either way. Let's get them off their couches and into the community. Maybe a field trip to see first hand what goes on? That could give the kids a wake up call. Just put yourself in the shoes of the needy. How would you feel? Alone? Helpless? Maybe like no one cares? Well I know I care. Let's get everyone else on our page.

Sincerely,

"''Hey, should I wear this or this tomorrow?'' I'm sure we've all had a friend ask us our opinion's on something, like what to wear on the first day of school, but ever wonder why they go and ask others on their perspective as well? The majority of people tend to ask more than one person about their thoughts on something because They want to know what the most common response is and they want to see other people's perspectives besides their own while keeping an opened mind.

First, the reasons why a person wishes to seek the most common response. Someone such as a friend will usually ask more than one of his/her piers on their thoughts or opinions on something and will go on asking more people the same question. After, he/she will take all the responses they have received and will most likely go with what the majority of what their piers said. People tend to do this because they want to have an open mind about what a group of people think rather than just one person. Next, why seeking multiple opinions can lead to a better choice. By asking multiple friends, piers, and even family members their thoughts on something that may or may not be important, it could help save someone from making a bad choice in the future. To conclude everything that was previously stated, Asking for multiple opinions is a great way to double check if someone is making the right choice because they will have stopped them from making a choice that they could have regretted ten years from then.

Second, why its good to see other people's perspective besides your own.

I know when I need someone's opinion I dont just ask one person I ask all my friends and even some of my family member's before I make a decision, and I also ask why they went with that choice to have a better understanding as to what helped them conclude to their response. By looking through someone else's perspective it could lead to a more open mind and can give a person more room to understand what other people think and why they think it . Next, why its special having an open mind. Having an open mind is when someone is able to take other people's opinions and instead of judging it they try to understand it. I believe people who ask for multiple opinions are very open minded and are willing to listen to other people's perspective besides their own. In conclusion, it is always important to keep an open mind when asking other people for their opinions or advice.

To conclude this entire essay, When someone is asking for advice or opinions about something they are just trying to keep an open mind are trying to make the right decision that they wont regret later in their life. So next time someone asks for an opinion don't get jealous when they walk away to ask another person the same question, remember that they are just trying to keep an open mind and they want to hear what others have to say too. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Phones and Driving.

Majority of people have phones and have a vehicle that they use dailey. Should people use their phones while operating a vehicle? The answer is no people should not be able to use phones during operating a vehicle. Using phones while operating a vehicle is dangerous. The phone distracts people from doing what they need to do.

Phones are technology that people use for everything. Phones can engage a person on a high level scale to where people a lot of times don't even know what they are doing. Phones carry a lot of things for people to use like apps, social media, and face timing. All of these things on the phone distract the person using it and they are just stuck in the virtual world and they barley enjoy the real world because they are in their phones too much. These points are valid because people will use their phones while operating a vehicle.

Using phones while operating a vehicle is very dangerous for the persons safety and others. Using a phone while operating a vehicle is already illegal so that's also a main reason not to use the phone while driving a vehicle. People can not use phones during operating a vehicle because they will be too distracted and they will not pay attention to the road or area they are going to. People should not be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle it puts other people in danger and you do not want to be hit or do the hitting.

People will suffer if they use their phones while operating. Say for an example you are on your phone while driving and u hit a person with your car the first thing the cops are going to ask you, is what where you doing. And you would say i was on my phone and you would go to jail and for a long time because it's illegal to use your phone while driving. While all that is happening your going to be thinking and regretting that you pulled out your phone while driving and if you killed the person then you would probably be in jail for life and no one wants that. So people should not be able to use their phones while driving.

No one should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle. It's illegal already you don't need any more trouble because bad consequences will happen. It's dangerous for the driver and the people around.

The phone distracts very hard to the point where the person using it doesn't pay attention in the real world. People should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle.       ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"My argument about Lukes point of view is that in paragraph four it show that Luke had made nine trips, so Luke tavels to a lot of different places. Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowboys program to teach what Luke does when he is a seagoing cowboy.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when he is a seagoing cowboy he ahd to take care of animals when he was a seagoing cowboy, such as a horse and a cow. Luke and his friend Don signed up to probably or most likely show that Luke was a good seagoing cowboy. Luke had crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times that had affected by World War two.

Details from the article that supports Lukes claims is Luke always helped other animals that had was showed in the passage. I think others would join Lukes program because he is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

I think that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy because in the passage it shows that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy. Luke showed that he wanted to help others and animals as he would want to start a program. Luke had toured an excavated castle in crete and maeveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I think he liked China as the best tour that he probably been on before, because he talked a lot about China in the passage about where different parts in China that he had been to that had been stated in the passage. The conclusion is that Luke is a good seagoing cowboy that was showed in the passage. And he loves that he is doing in the passage i think, he likes caring for other animals that were in the passage that it was stated in the passage.      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Technology is being used in a variety of different ways. It can find anything asked to find, do anything asked to do, it make you happy, sad, feel any emotion known to man. Technology that can recognize when the owner is upset then turn the emotions around to being happy is on it's way. The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enabling computers to identfy students emotions in the classroom is a great idea to have. It can make school and simply just school a better experience for the students and for the teachers.

If a student gets bored while working on a assignment on the computer then the new FACS technology could change that. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused ot bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" That means whenever the student is getting bored of the lesson and wants to stop working then the technology would see that the student is getting sidetracted and change the lesson up a little bit so the student would keep working and get involved again. The teacher would have to do less work because they wouldn't have to yell at the kids to get back to work, the computer could get them to work again. It benefits the both the student and the teacher by not letting the kid fall behind in school work and making the day easier on the teacher.

Humans don't communicate or talk about emotions anymore. Way back then when there wasn't any technology people would interact with each other and talk about enotions. Now that there's technology everywhere you look people have their faces stuck into it and don't socialize. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" What Dr. Huang is saying is completely true, people don't talk and socialize anymore, so if everyone has technology and is always using it then the new technology FACS is a great thing for technology to have. When someone is upset and sad and just on a phone or computer it will recognize that and make things on the screen pop up that made you happy and smile before. It would be a great addition to technology at school, if a student is having a bad day and gets on the computer the computer will see the emotion and make things pop up or try something different to make the student happy and stop being upset.

Anatomy is about people, the body, and how muscles and everything works to move and show emotion. In paragrapgh five it stats ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" That shows that Dr. Huangs technology knows exactly how people show emotion and move and everything. The technology would be spot on and be able to tell that the student is drifting away from the lesson and getting distracted, then the technology can make it more interesting. Then the student would start to work again and be able to work while having fun and being happy at the same time.

Dr. Huangs technology system known as Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would be a great thinig to have at schools everywhere. The technology would be ableto know when the student was getting confused and bored and modify the lesson or activity to make it easier and more fun for the student. It would make students grades go up as the technology makes the lesson easier for the student to understand and do. The technologhy knows exactly when to change the lesson up and when to try to make the sudent smile and happy again. The new technology FACS by Dr. Huang would be a great addition to computers and technology at school.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Although, Venus is seen as unlivable and dangerous to human life, NASA has thought of an idea to defeat the odds. Venus is our neighboring planet, and once long ago, may have been the most Earth-like. To this day, there are still some anologous features. Will this be enough to convince the Nation that we should send NASA astronuats to Venus?

Venus is protected by a thick atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide. The clouds on Venus are highly corrosive. Temperatures average 800 degrees F, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more than what we experience here on Earth. If our neighboring planet is so inhospitable, why do scientists want to visit it?

NASA has a possible solution to all of these conditions that a human cannt withstand. The article states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" NASA's plan is to have a spacecraft floating above Venus' toxic atmosphere. Temperatures would still be toasty, at around 170 degree Fahrenheit. But the air pressure would be close to Earths at sea level. There would be enough solar power, and the radiation levels would not exceed Earth's. These are not easy living conditions, but they are just enough for survival. This brilliant idea does come with soem downfalls. The astronauts would not be able to collect samples of rock, gas, or anything from this distance. Standard forms of photography or videography would render useless.

I think NASA should not send researches to Venus without having enough background information. They should continue conducting research. If researchers would to Venus, they would have to risk their health and maybe even lives, to collect some samples. I think NASA should work on different mechanical and technological approaches.

Exploring Venus could give NASA insight information of its past, present and future features. Although NASA has come up with a seemingly brilliant plan, there is some downsides to it. Overall, safety becomes the first priority, there is still some work that needs to be done.            ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because some computers can give you wrong information. you cant always rely on a software. In Paragraph 7 , it says "" your PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. but we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions, i really think technology is doing the work for us.

We need to take time and do it ourselves and expressing our own feelings because sometimes when you actually happy you got a natural mean mug. The software is going to get the wrong information when it tries to figure out our feelings. moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. making faces cant reveal so much about the science of emotions. You gonna spend your money on something that might get your feelings wrong . That will be the waste of your money.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I think that students will benefit from being able to attend classes online.

The reason i support this question is because some student are not able, to attend school during the day or night time for example; in others country or this can happen in any country, Some students have to work all day for pay bills or help there family buy food, clothes, etc. or they live alone with brothers and sisters and is difficult for them to have a education because they have to work for take care of there family.

Sometimes student have to go out of town or flight to others country and they have to get out of school for days or months and that is the bad thing about that because, if you mess a lot of day you can fail you classes or don't graduate on time. The good thing about online classes is that after work or when you have free time you can go online and do your work or video conference with the person you taking you classes.

Things about the online classes is that, if you can't go to school you can take it at home or any place you want, they only thing you have to got is a computer or phone internet or you can go to a public library and also if you are taking the video conference class you need a computer with camera that's all. For that i think that school that got online classes or video conference classes can help a lot of student to graduate and have a better future, or better life and they can work and help there family at the same time.

Also for adult if they don't finish school at time they can take oline classes, also if you graduated from school you can take a carrier online, and is not necesary to attend to college you can work in whatever you working and study online the classes, online is the best way for people that can not attend to school or people that work all day or travel always to study and got a GED",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Limited car usage has plenty of advantages. A few examples of advantages that come from limited car usage are lessining the amount of gases polluting the air, also it would create a friendly and neighborly enviorment, and a large amount of money would be saved.

To limit car usage has huge benefits; we can lessen the gasses that are polluted, lessening smog. It may not sound like something that effects your everyday life, but it does. Smog and air pollution are a problem, and a threat to our safety and well being. As of right now it is'nt a life or death situation, but if car usage continues to be a huge part of the world, all the air pollution from all the years of driving are going to get so bad people, and the earths atmosphere will be extremly affected by it. Think about your kids future, would you really want them to live in a world consumed by air pollution, and emission gasses, and smog.. To give an example, ""passneger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states"" (rosenthal). That just showing how much car usage affects air pollution and the air we breath everyday. Just decreasing the amount of car usage can reduce the smog, and air pollution in cities and towns.

Additionally, the less cars are used the more people and neighbors would intteract. If a majority of a town just lessened the amount they go out using a car, they would walk, or ride bikes, or take busses, etc.. imagine your town, and families and their kids taking a walk somewhere, or people riding their bicycles to their destination, everyone could meet their neighbors and talk. Overall, cities and towns and suburben areas would generally become just a friendly enviorment. Most people want to live in a place in which they feel safe and neighborly. Teenagers and families would get more excersise then the normal. Due to having to walk, and ride bikes or other things they would be getting out of the house more instead of sitting in a car then going and sitting some place then going back home and sitting around again, they would get the needed physical activity to stay some what healthy. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day""(selsky). That is amazing, and it is so good for people to get out and do things like that. Lessening car usage could completly change neighborhoods and towns and citiies.

Finally, Cars in the united states are highly expensive, and not everyone has thousands of dollars around to get the car they want/need. ""Cash strapped americans could not afford new cars""(Rosenthal). Just an example that cars are not cheap and a lot of people spend money they do not have on cars. In addition to buying the car, gas must be provided, depending on the car and the amount of gas it uses up, that can be pretty expensive. Insurance is another cost, everyone has to have insurance to be able to drive and own a car, thats a monthly fee coming out of our pockets. Limiting car usage could save a lot of money, it would leave extra money every day, week or month to go out and eat once in a while, or to buy other necisities. Just about everyone wants to have a little extra money, but with a car thats frequently used can use up almost 200 to 400 dollars each month. Riding a bike, or skateboarding or just simply walking is completly free.

Advantages in limited car usage are, The decrease in gas pollution and smog, it could create friendlier neighborhoods and towns, and lastly thousands of people would save a lot of money.                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Most people would think of an electoral collage as a place rather than a system. The Electoral collage was a process that was create to help make voting easier when in fact it complicated things. I agree with with source 2 paragraph 14. paragraph 14 clear states ""It's official: The electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" i am completely convinced that the electoral collage is no longer necessary. There is a lot wrong with it, such as having to trust people to be honest and vote the right way, or simply just discrediting a state because of it population.

With the electoral collage, you are to have state representatives. Your state is to take a majority vote and relay that information to the state representatives. Then the state representatives will then vote according to how the majority persuaded them to vote. However many things can go wrong with this they can simply vote their way or like paragraph 10 states, they can get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.

Due to the fact states have electoral votes based on size and population that one vote could cost the election. on the other hand, the electoral vote are very unfair. i believe everybody should have their own individual say so in elections.

Some of you may believe that this saves time, but in reality everybody has to vote anyway. in fact it takes more time by deciding state representatives and so on and so forth. i really couldn't think of any other reasons you would want such a corrupt system like thus one. this system is obscured.

I guess its all in what you believe. i personally believe this system is outdated. i doubt this system even worked well in the old days. Now-a-days there is some crazy people in this world. it is hard to trust anybody, even family. Also America always preaches against discrimination however they still portray it. the have discrimination against some states because they lack people. however some states choose to lack people so the don't have to become an industrial state. they may want to maintain that farm state feeling. farmers tend to take up a lot of land pushing people away. frankly we still need farmers. just like we need a new system.     ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In my opinion students should come to school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students,which allows the students to be irresponsibles and not to show their work to the teacher. As we can see taking classes online is not a good option to us, for instance if we dont make the time to attend the classes online, or by the time we are taking the online classes we received a text for friend we stop doing what we are doing and got distracted by the electronic devices and, others words if we come to school received classes we are going to be able to get the knowledge that we need to be great in our academic life.

I consider myself that taking online classes is not a good option for students. Some students that take online classes are procrastinators,they dont care about their homework, or they wait until the last minute to do it. The truth is, if we dont take our online classes seriously how we are going to learn. For example,

My friend Generic_Name is taking online classes and she said that taking online classes allow her to be irresponsible by not doing her homework.

Some students dont make the time to take the online classes and we just forget to take it. I wonder how we are going to learn if we dont make the time to do it. Sometimes we got distracted for something that have nothing to with the class that we are taking. However, if we have a job and we got home late, and in our mind is to get home and take the online classes, but when we get home we are so tired and we just want to go to bed, and forget about what we have to do.

The last and more important reason what we should take classes in school is, if we attend to school,we can ask questions to the teacher and he can provides us with a powerful answers and specific examples, if we attend to school that will helps us to get a responsibility to be every day at school and not to miss any important class, and also that would gives the knowledge that we would need to be great in life.

In final consideration I think students should come to school and take our classes, that way we would learn more better than taking it in online, and also that we will makes us more responsible. As we take the classes in school we will get the knowledge that we would need to success in our academic life in general we would be great in our professional life.  ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Should or Shouldn't people use their phones while driving?

What my opinion on this topic is no and the reason why I say this because people (mostly teenagers) can't focus when they have a phone in the car, they will keep using it which causes them to get distracted like for example in a BBC article they estimated that all 6% of car accidents happen because people were on their mobile phones this also means that 12,000 serious injuries and 2,600 deaths each year in the U.S. And on the news on April 8, 2019, a teen who was speeding at 106 mph while on the social media app Snapchat got in a car accident with her friend but because she was paying attention got her friend killed and now that teen will be faced with 15 years in prison and many more like this happened to teens, adults, elders, etc.

Because of them using their mobile phones while driving and not paying attention to the road.

The first photo was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Spacecraft. The craft was circleing Mars trying to find a spot for its sister ship to land. The Viking 2 Spacecraft. The first reason to why people think it is alien. Is the quality of the pictures that were taken. The first picture was taken in 1976 so the resolution of the picture wasnt very good. Which caused it to look like there was a nose, eyes and a mouth. But pictures that were taken years after show that it could have been the quality.

There is another reasonable explanation. During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow. But many still believe that it is alien. Even though this some of the best evidence to peove the face on mars isnt alien but a mistake.

But the most compelling reason is. It is simialr to some of the rock formations that we have on Earth. Scientist have found that in the western United States there are rock formations that are very similar. They are simailasr to the snake river palin in Idaho.

After a lengthy expalnation. I hoope i have provided enough facts to prove to you that. The face on Mars was not created by aliens. but created by an optical illusion. That are found on Earth as well as On Mars. And i hope This has been very informative for you.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The Seagoing Cowboys were great heroes to other country's because they transported food and horses for people who didn't have food or any transportation. Just think how good you would feel if you knew that you saved people lives just by giving them food. Well i'm going to tell you what it would feel like and why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Just think of becoming a true life hero, you could become a soldier,nurse,doctor, or a Seagoing Cowboy! Seagoing Cowboys were people (men) who transported Cows, Mules, and Horses. They transported them from America to Europe,Greece,and China. Europe was left in ruins after World War || was over, so people signed up to become a Seagoing Cowboy. They would get on ships with 300+ horses, cows, and mues and enough hay and oats to feed them. A Seagoing Cowboy would check up on them every hour to make sure the animals were alright. Wow what a job.

This story is mainly about how great Seagoing Cowboys are and what they bring to other countries. They transported animals to other countries who didn't have food or transportation. Seagoing Cowboys were true heroes, they cared for animals and people. They had kind hearts for both of them.      ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I think that students should be able to have cell phones during school but should be turned off during classes. The only times the students will be allowed to have there cell phones out is during the morning, lunch, and during any breaks that they have.

Having cell phones out during classes is a distraction towards the student because if the teacher is giving a lesson that is really important and they students are not listening, then the student is out of luck if the notes that they were supposed to take were on a test. If the students have there phones out during math class, they could be cheating on a test or an assignment that the teacher has given them.

Students should only be able to use there cell phones if they don't feel good or if they are in trouble. They should only be able to call there parents for those reasons only or if they forgot something at there house. But if they are using that cell phone to text there friends because they are bored, then that cell phone should be taken away by a teacher or the principal.

The students are not getting the education they need if they are on there cell phone throughout all of there classes or for the entire school year. If the students are not paying attention to there teacher and there teacher says to put the cell phone away and they don't listen, them that's when the teacher should taken there cell phone away from them. There is no need for them to be on that cell phone when they are in class. Some students are failing classes because they are not paying attention to the lesson the teacher is trying to tell the students.

The students are not going to pay attention if the teacher does not do anything about the cell phone problems. The students will just keep ignoring them and ignoring them. That is no way for a teacher to be treated by a student. So, they can have there cell phones nut not during classes. If students don't follow the rule then just take away there phone and have there parents come in and get it so parents know why they got there phone taken away at school.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"While for many years the traditional way of a class comprised of students physically being in the class to learn, now in the age of the internet students can participate in the classroom at home. People believe that students should still go to school but students gain many benefits when they attend school at home because they have more personal time, have better attendance, and make schools less crowded.

Students have been balancing school and after curricular activities for a long time now, but students would have more available time if they took online classes. Students can choose classes based on their own personal schedule. This would make it easier to balance their day because they can do there classes before or after their activities. Also the classes would be flexible unlike normal school where there is a fixed time one must be at school to learn, now it can change based on a student's daily tasks. If a student is late or sick one day instead of missing precious class time and material they now can catch up on later in the day with out any backlash. Online classes would help give students more free time because the class depends on how fast a kid can learn and complete the material. If a student is really gifted they can learn and finish new material very quickly, which gives them more time to focus on their own lives and not about school. Traditionally in the classroom the teachers job is to make sure that all the students learn, therefore many times a handful of students would be ready to move on and learn but the teacher cannot because there are other students who are behind. Online classes solve this by making it possible for a student to move on individually at what ever pace they need it to be. The introduction of online classes can gift a student with more time and freedom.

When a student misses school they lose a lot of valuable learning but with online classes they will achieve a better attendance record. Online school makes it possible so the classroom is where ever a student has a smart device with an internet connection. That means that whether a student is on vacation or is in a blizzard they can learn. The student will never have to miss another class because they are sick because they can even learn in their bed, this will severely cut down the attendance gap that many students have. Online schooling will decrease the rates that students skip. When a students skips school they would usually be able to make up the work the next day but with online classes they would stay at home and would have to complete their work or their grades would suffer, so this cuts down the days a student would be able to skip and not do any work. Online schooling helps coax kids into not skipping and pushes learning on the go, this drastically helps with missed time in the class room

Many schools around the country are over crowded but with online schooling taking kids out of the school majorly helps with overcrowding. When online schooling takes away kids from a school that is overcrowded it takes off the stress put on the education system there. This makes class rooms smaller and teachers more available to a smaller class but for more time. This also helps the students by making there school day more efficient. When a school gets smaller they can spread their resources more efficiently. Now not only do students at home who take online classes get benefits but also kids in schools. The school now has more money, time and availability to each individual student, which enriches their own learning. Online classes helps take away students from schools and helps with overcrowding and in the process improve the learning of others.

With the introduction of online learning, students in school or at home both receive great benefits that improve their educational experience. This happens through the process of giving students more time, keeping them in school, and relieving other schools of overcrowding. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I think that the idea of driverless cars are a good idea, but I don't think they are necessary at all. They are pointless and cars should be driven manually. The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen.

A good opposition to the idea of driverless cars is the psychological aspect. In the passage, it says, ""psychological aspects are really a challenge,"" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. The driverless cars are still going to require gasoline as fuel.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not worth the investment. They will still need human assistance and drivers will be bored waiting for their turn to drive. The amount of gas needed will still be the same to power all the cars. This is why driverless cars are pointless.                         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In my opinion, driverless cars are going to be a positive thing for people. The driverless cars have been improving throughout the years,they will be more safe, and they will make us more alert when driving.

Driverles cars have been on the road to progress for a number of years. They have been upgraded to figure out what does and doesn't work. For example, in the text it says, "" For example, in the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car."" It also says, "" These smart- road systems worked surprisingly weel, but they required massive upgrades to exisiting roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This evidence shows that the driverless cars have been tested and improved throughout the years.

Another reason why I think driverless cars are a good thing is because of safety. These driverless cars have sensors that help the car and the human be in control of it. In the text it says, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" This evidence shows that these sensors can help the human driver drive more safe. Another piece of evidence is that in the text it says, "" The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under the consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" This evidence shows that the more they are working on driverless cars, the more ways they are finding ways to make them more safe.

My last reason to why driverless cars are better than others are because they make the drivers more alert when driving. In the text it talks about how the driverless cars will not be completely driverless because there is still human control needed. In the text it says, "" but the special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps a hold of the wheel."" Also it says, "" They can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situations requires."" This evidence shows that the driver must be alert and focused, not slacking off and not paying attention.

In conclusion I think driverless cars are going to be a positive thing for people because they have been improving them over the years, they will be more safe, and they will help us become more alert when driving. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Many people have experiences that they remember in life. That could be from the first date to a trip to the Bahamas. But little do they cherish their time in school. Schools have gone from being a class taught by a teacher to being at the fingertips on a digital device, but do these devices benefit or hurt the growing generation. Schools have been successful at giving opportunities for all students like collaborative work, hands-on experiences, and the ability to have one-on-one communication between a teacher and the student.

One reason why classroom setting education is beneficial is because of the collaboration among friends. Students tend to enjoy their education much better when they have friends to share it with. The classroom is an environment where students can work on activities together and share their knowledge. It is also good for students to take breaks every once in a while and to communicate with their friends so that they can refresh and get back to learning. Collaboration is something that is generally not found in online classes and causes the student to lose interest in the class. When students have the opportunity of working with peers, it increases their interest and productivity as a result of having a classroom education.

Another benefit to the classrooms is the hands-on experience it includes. Students show more interest in classes that provide selections of activities that go with the topic that is being taught. Schools provide enjoyable experiences that lead to better student development. Students do not enjoy the aspect of repetitive and tiring labor while studying for online courses. Hands-on and entertaining activities add to the excitement of learning in classes.

The final reason that working in classrooms is beneficial is that students can work with their teachers. With online classes, there is a lack in there being people that can help educate an individual person. Classes allow teachers to learn about their students, figure out their weaknesses, and help each one individually. With online courses, students do not often have answers to their questions that they need; sure, maybe they can search the Web, but they do not have somebody that can interpret information so that it can be remembered. In order for students to have improved success, students need one-on-one help from their teachers.

Even though it may be true that online classes can provide more time to study and to learn, classrooms in schools provide a better learning environment over the alternative online classes. Opportunities from schools like collaborative work, classroom activities, and help from teachers provide a better learning environment that bring better success out of students. Online classes may not be providing the correct balance of interest and help that drive success in students. Keeping classrooms like they have been will progress the growing generations to be as successful as past generations because of the great public education that is has been in place. Before applying for online courses, is this the experience you want? ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"If we limit car usage there would be less pollution, we would save thousands of dollars, and it would inprove our safety. So if you really think about it, less usage of cars would be a great impact for us in a good sense.

For starters, experts say we have to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the U.S. Our planet is already polluted enough..why add more to it. For example; diesel trucks make up 67% of vechicles in France..which then adds more smog. In addition, Paris has more smog than othe European capitals. Once Paris had 147 microgrmas of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. In the city of Bagota, Colombia their goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, violaters faced a $25 fine.

Futhermore, not only would there be less pollution..but we would save thousands of dollars..on gas and insurance. Gas is one of the most important things for a car, it makes it function. But also we would be fine if we didnt have it, mainly because we would save hundreds of dollars a month. The average cost for a gallon of gas is $3.70. Not only gas but insurance and repair jobs. Insurance is as expensive as it is when you wreck your car, if you're lucky enough your insurance could possibly pay for it depending whos fault it was who caused the accident.

In conclusion, at the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, excutive chairman of the Ford motor Company..laid out a bussiness plan, he proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in pedestrian, bicycles, public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmisions and impove safety. So therefore safety is the #1 for most companies.

To sum things up we would have less pollution, save money, and our safety would be guarented. Those are the great advanatges of having our usage of cars be limited.                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Do you think it is a good idea to succeed? I believe it is good to succeed in life, that is why seeking opinions from multiple people helps you succeed. I believe seeking help from multiple people can help you make better decisions. A couple reasons why I think that is, It helps you succeed in life, It helps when making a decision, and an example is that I made a great decision In my life.

First, seeking multiple opinions helps people succeed in life. One way is when going to college. College is very important to people's life and people giving opinions to them is encouraging them that is will be fun. Another way is when a person is mad at somebody. People encouraging them to stop can help them stop being mad. The last reason is when somebody is taking a test they can get help. When they are stuck then can ask a question to the teacher and can get a opinion on the question and then that can help them get the question right. Get multiple opinions it will help you succeed in life.

Second, getting multiple opinions helps when making a decision. It helps when picking out what shirt or shorts or any type of clothing they want. When they dont know what type of clothing they want to buy multiple opinions can help a lot when not knowing what to get. It also helps when picking which shoe they want and which one is the best for them. Opinions from parents and the workers that are helping the person will help them see if the shoes fits and if it is the right type for them. It also helps when the person doesnt know which place they want to go to. Getting opinions and ideas from friends will help when picking which place you want to go. Multiple opinions helps a person when making a decision.

The last one is that I made a good decision. One day I was playing basketball and this guy got mad because i blocked his shot. After I blocked his shot he wanted to fight me. So he came after me, he laid a punch on my chest. It hurt pretty bad. I wanted to fight him and punch him back so badly because I wanted to stick up for myself. Then, my friends who we were playing with said,""Don't punch back it is not the right thing to do,"" so i didint punch back and I walked away and went home. I was OK, but I had a big bruise on my chest. That is an example of how multiple opinions from others can help you make better decisions. If I would have not walked away, we would have got into a big fight. So, I am glad that I walked away. My parents were very happy as well. Always make the right decision and the good choice not the bad choice.

I believe seeking a lot of opinions will help you make better decisions in life. Seeking multiple decisions can help you succeed in life, It can also help when making a decision and, lastly I made a very good decision in my life. Always seek a lot of opinions before doing things that they are not sure about.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. A summer project is used to keep a students skills sharp while they are away from school. A summer project can be things like reading a certain amount of books for English, or, making a model of some sort for Engineering. The opposition wrongly believes that summer projects should be teacher designed because the teacher knows a students strengths' and weaknesses. Although some may believe that summer projects are a teachers job to design, it should be known that the student should be able to design their own summer project.

There are many immediate benefits of a students planning their own project. An example of an immediate benefit is a person strengthening their skills. Strengthening a persons skills is when they work on skills that are not as strong as their other ones. For example, one way to sharpen a persons math skills would be to make a project focused solely on math, or, a person can make a project where they type a book to strengthen their writing skills. Sharpening a persons skills can help them because, when they go back to school their skills would have improved. Another immediate of a student planning their own project is learning some pizzazz. Pizzazz is a persons little twist on something. For example, a student can add a little dance or rap to a presentation that they have to make their project fun so that it wont be so boring. Learning pizzazz can benefit a student by teaching them to have fun while learning. The last immediate benefit of a student designing their own project is they learn responsibility. Responsibility is a sign of maturity in young adults. For example, a students teacher is expecting them to get a project done over the summer, so, the student gets it done with no hesitation. Responsibility helps a student by teaching them to be responsible which makes them more mature when they get back from summer break and be ready to learn.

There are many benefits that a student can use in the long run from designing their own projects. One benefit they learn is work ethic. Work ethic is a persons perseverance to get the job done in enough time and it be done correctly. For example, if a teacher assigns a summer project that the student must design, having work ethic pushes you to get it done. Having work ethic makes a students work much easier and relieves teachers of stress. Another benefit a student can learn is planning skills. Planning skills are skills that help a student plan activities or events. For example, a student needs to plan a project but lacks planning skills they would not know what to do. Planning skills help a student by teaching them to plan so that when the time comes to plan something they are ready. The final benefit a student learns from designing their own summer projects is creativity. Creativity is a persons sense of imagination and a way for people to express themselves. For example, being creative on a project can show people a persons character and a persons mindset. Creativity can help a person in the long run by teaching a person how to stand out in a group of people.

Although some may think summer projects are a teachers job to design, it should be known that the design of a summer project is students job. The opposition wrongly believes that summer projects should be a teachers job due to the fact that they know what to give us in order to strenghten our weaknesess. However suummer projects should be student designed because of the immediate benefits such as strengthening a students skills, it teaches responsibility, and pizzazz, also there are benefits in the long run such as a better work ethic, planning skills, and creativity. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Is something wrong with cell phones being allowed in school? There is no such accunization. Cell phones are used for important purposes and should be allowed in school and usable except in class. That's why i chose to go along with policy one.

Policy one states that cell phones will be allowed in school and that students could use them during lunch and other free periods. However in class, they are to be silenced and put away! There are many reasons for this policy. It also helps the kids not get in trouble as much. Students mostly get in trouble for texting in class.

This policy is trying to prevent students from sharing test answers in class. If they text in class they could be texting their friends telling them the answers and that is called cheating. Cheating is really a wrong thing to do, it shows what you know not your friend. Major consequences are handed out to cheaters that can cause them to fail or suffer in their career choices. Therefore cheating is prohibited.

Another thing that is being prevented is the lack of knowledge. Students think they can text and listen simultaneously. But truth is all the information is going in one ear and out the other. It is important because it can help you in life. Grades reach higher levels than texting in my opinion.

The students shouldn't have a problem because, it gives them the opportunity to use it during the daytime. It's not like a prison where they have no cell phone. Students should be very grateful and lucky. They have many breaks to use them just not when it is time to be focused. Hopefully, this will help kids in the future.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principal ...

wrote this letter to tell you that it is completely unfair that you would change the school policy to it being that you have to have a grade B average to be in sports or other activities like that. First of all most of the kid in the school don't even have a grade B- average to start with so that means that there will be lesser kids in the different clubs or activities so they will have to shut it down and the kids will start leaving the school because there are no good clubs in the school, and then school will sooner or later shut down.

I guess i could see the reason why you would change the policy you might think kid will try harder to get a B average and maybe some kid might but those are only the kids whose parents will not let them change schools but over all that might be at least 26 percent of the kids who have lower than a B average and is definitely not going to be enough to keep the clubs or the school open. i really how you put to mind what i have to say.

"I think electoral college is a terrible idea. I will be giving some of the reasons why i think this ""process"" is a horrible thing to do. By the end of my essay i hope you will agree with me that electoral college is a waste of time.

Electoral college is a ""non-domocratic"" way for electing a new president. I personally think that we should count peoples votes and not decide by the majority of the state. I say this because its unfair to the people who voted for the President that didnt get elected because the majority of the state voted for the other president.

Although if most of the state voted for a President that President is guaranteed that he got most of the peoples votes. Another thing that's unfair is that California has more electoral votes than Texas however, there is a chance that Texas is more populated than California. So if the votes were counted by person instead of state there would be a better chance of the President you voted for win the election.

So these are just a few of the reasons why I think electoral college is basically just a huge waste of time and why its unfair to the states with a lower number of electoral votes. Hopefully they will start to count votes in a regular way instead of giving each state a certain number of electoral votes.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Some schools require the students to do a project during the summer to assure that the students are still learning during the break. I think that is dumb because the kids are supposed to have a break from school during the summer but i am going to side with the student designed projects. The reason i am siding with student designed is because i am a student myself and I know that students are able to make projects that are fun and still show that They are continuing to learn while they are not at school. One big example of students working on a project they designed is a science project they are not told what to do in it or how to do it by a teacher all they know is decide what to do, then get the materials, then execute the project and then bring it back to school so that goes to show that students can decide what to do for their project. Some people may say that, teachers need to design the students projects so they need to know what to do so they don't get off track but however they are wrong because there are a lot of bright students that don't need a teacher's help with a lot of things and im pretty sure that they don't need help on deciding on something as simple as a project that can be anything that they want.

Schools that don't let the students decide on anything are holding them back on what could be their next future job or career, so schools that let students decide on things are trying to help them reach that potiental so they could decide for themselves on a lot of thing and don't have to have someone tell them they have to do this a certain type of way so at the same time its not just letting them decide on what they want to do for a project they are giving them the freedom to decide what they want to do so when they leave school there is no one that have to tell them what to do every step of the way. But for the schools that have to decide for the students everyday without letting them choose for themselves that is not really helping the students really because when they have to do something by themselves they are going to need someone to coach them through life and show them simple things that could be easily understood but the can't do that be cause in school they had someone to do all deciding for them.

In conclusion, let the students decide their projects so they can do something for themselves and not have the assignment handed to them. The IB personal project can be used for another example of a student designed project. With the IB personal project it takes months because it requires a lot of steps for each individuals project, first you have to plan and decide what you are going to do for that project, second you have to execute the plan and keep up with it so you can write about it, third you have to write a 3000 word paper about the project explaining what you did and how you did it, fourth you have to print out everything you did and put it on a poster board, and finally you have to wait until march 17 for the IB person project fair where you have to present your project to all the family members and friends that will be attending. Some people may say that just because you let students decide what they are goign to do with a project doesn't mean that they wont be depending on someone to help them in life but however they are wrong because that little piece of freedom to decide what they are going to do on a project is getting one step closer to be a self depending person.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principle,

I have heard that there are disagreements over whether to perform community service or not. I will present the advantages to both sides of this matter, and suggest one of my own opinion. However, the decision shall remain yours. While community service is very helpful, some people may disagree. This is because it uses their own time. These are the two dominant sides to this matter.

Community service is something that benefits everyone, including the ones performing it. It allows you to contribute to society and help others. Public services are greatly affected by small services from people like you and me. Things such as malls, churches, schools, hospitals, and even highways are good places to start. They allow you to help out in small ways, and are simple and easy places to help, such as by picking up trash, repainting parking lots, emptying trash cans, and many other things like these.

However, some people do not like that this spends their personal time. I can understand this, and hopefully you can too. Some people need time alone or with family, and most would definitely prefer that over community service. Many people, however, are constantly preoccupied, so they are unable to help. They have things to do such as meeting friends, attending parties, visiting relatives, and such things as these.

I am between both sides, for I believe in public services, and personal time. My plan is that we should perform these services, but in the times we choose. This should satisfy both sides, for it will not take up any important times, and it will benefit the community overall. Though it may be more towards the side of community service, I hope you will take my plan into consideration while making this decision. I hope that you will choose wisely, and that my fellow students will be satisfied with whatever choice you do select.

Sincerely,

"In today's schools, it is often difficult for students to succeed in a classroom environment. In fact, it is common to hear students express their frustrations of being in a classroom with the phrase, ""I would rather be at home"". Although it is traditional and ideal for students to get their education from within a school, it is not always best. Due to today's modern technical advancements, a student could benefit more in school, if learning new subjects were offered on a computer screen, in the comfort of their own home. Schools should offer distance learning to students because of the comfortable working space, the limited amount of distractions, and the work will get done more efficiently.

At Generic_School, a sol was canceled due to the A.C. systems not working. It was extremely hot inside the school as well as outdoors, making it unbearable for any student to take the test. It is important for students to have comfortable working space so they are able to perform at their best. If a student works from the comfort of their own home, they are able to get more work done without having to worry about facing unexpected difficulties. Students are also able to work in their pajamas allowing them to be relaxed and at ease while doing work or actively learning a subject. A serene environment allows for students to see learning as enjoyable rather than terrifying or boring. Schools should offer distance learning because it allows students to be in a comfortable working space.

In school environments, students deal with daily distractions such as: class clowns, school fights, and gossip. However, distance learning would minimize those distractions. While working at home, students would not be exposed to distractions caused by the misbehavior other children. For example, at Generic_School, multiple students would pull the fire alarm in order to get out of the first 15-20 minutes of class. This caused learning periods to become shorter and kept teachers from following their lesson plans. The behavior of a few misguided classmates caused the entire school to lose focus on their classwork. Alas the home environment would significantly decrease the distractions that would be caused by the disorderly conduct of others. With limited distractions, students are able to get more work completed. Therefore, schools should offer distance learning in order to limit distractions from one's learning environment.

When students are offered distanced learning, it gives them a chance to learn the subject at a more personal level. Most teachers have to teach over 100 students a day, they give the same lectures and worksheets without getting a chance to personal interact with every student. Distance learning allows for students to get the attention they need to fully understand the concept of what they are learning. The more the student understands the lesson that is taught, the better they will understand the work given to them. At home, the student would not have to depend on other classmates for answers on the homework or a test. This will decrease the chances of cheating on assignments. The home environment forces students to pay attention in order to complete such assignments. Schools should offer distance learning because it causes students to work more efficiently.

Overall in today's schools, it is difficult for students to succeed in a classroom environment. Although it is traditional and ideal for students to get their education from within a school, it is not always the best way. Due to today's modern technology advancements, a student could benefit more in school, if learning new subjects was offered on a computer screen in the comfort of their own home. Schools should offer distance learning to students because of the comfortable working space, the limited amount of distractions, and the work will get done more efficiently. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I think is good idea to continue learning during their break because if we take this project we are ready to the next year to do anything example if you don't take this project you never be ready to the next year and you get F on you all class first , I think this can help me to better my self and better make the work in the school second , I think that everyone need take this project because this can help you to go better the next year to the high school in third reason i ask about the people don't like this project because they want to pass summer with his family but another people they wanned working all summer to get money and, I think is good idea, but when you working to much you don't wanned continue the high school and you leave the school because i have friend they started working and when we start again the high school they leave because they prefer the money and they don't continue studying.

I think this can help me to better my self and this can help you to go better the next year to the high school but there are people don't like this project because they want to pass summer with his family but another people they wanned working all summer to get money and we needed the high school because if we garduate we can go at the college or take a good work after high school.

"Don't ask one time. Ask many people as you can. Advice is another way saying "" I need your opinions about this "" why do people ask for advice, it they know going more one giving then opinions.

why a person ask multiple opinions because, the person giving advice had experiment before. you wanted know what is going to happen. The human mind is always full wounded. It might affect your future in life. You dont want to messed it up cause you might regent it later in life. You wanted know something before it happens or you will be scared. You want to know what is going happen next cause you're wondering. this one of my reasons why a person seeking multiple opinions can help someone form a better choices.

why a person ask multiple opinions because, they trust that person. You want someone that you trust with your life. if you dont trust that person and tell whole school your personal business. you want tell someone that is not going to embarrassed you . you might regent saying that to someone because it was embarrassing. if you dont trust why would tell them your problem. Tell that person might can get bullied for what you said. This is my second reason why an person multiple opinions can help someone make an better choice.

why an person ask multiple opinions because, they want more than one opinions. when you ask someone for their opinions, they might not agree with it. it's always better to ask more than person. The person might not understand about anything you talking about. Some people will give an fake answer. Lastly you need more opinions to fix your own problem. These days people dont know what they are talking about. In conclusion may ask yourself ""why do people seeking multiple opinions that can help someone make an better choice. they help in life and listen to their own opinions and trust.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"i think it's a good idea because if a student has a low grade in one of his/her' s subjects, it would lower his/her' s grade even more. so basically, it's a distraction to student with low grades that wants to participate in sports or other activities. i do not participate in school activities because i am not perfect on my grades to be honest. it will distract me and it may be the only thing i will think about other than my grades and focusing on my education which can really hurt my chances to be in a very good college. i am not the ""sporty"" type of person but i have friends that could not make it in their sports activities because of their grades. i would be disappointed for them but yet they have time to bring their grades up to make it up. i also have friends that have an A+ on their grades and are enjoying their sports activities such as basketball, soccer, volleyball, and also softball. i would be glad if you changed the school policy.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"""Oh come on!"" groans one of the students. All of the students have just been told that joining an extracurricular is now required. They are all upset now, but little do they know that they will be eternally grateful for it in the future. Making extracurricular activities required was a great decision. Students will have a beneficial learning experience, a better school experience, and gain guidance that can help them in the future.

Joining an extracurricular gives you a great learning experience. One of the benefits is new knowledge. Extracurricular activities teach you things that you would not learn in class, and that can be useful later. Some people argue that students will not have time for an extracurricular activity to be added to their schedule. However, classes can be adjusted so students have time for the activity if that is really the case. In most cases, students need better time management. They can learn this as they will need to be able to balance their schoolwork, their extracurricular, and anything else they may need to do regularly. Students will learn to manage their time wisely as a result of the added extracurricular, which is another benefit they will receive. Being apart of an extracurricular can also improve students' social skills. It gives you the opportunity to learn how to work responsibly and productively with others. Extracurricular activities give you new knowledge, time management skills, and social skills, which makes being apart of one a great learning experience.

Extracurricular activities can give you a better school experience. Extracurricular activities can make students happier and give them a good memory of school. Being apart of club they enjoy gives them something to look forward to. They can also help students step out of their comfort zone. Being required to take an extracurricular encourages them to try something they might not have tried otherwise. Joining an extracurricular can also help students meet new people as well. They can become friends with peers who share the same interests as them. Extracurricular activities can make school a place that students look forward to going to.

Extracurricular activities benefit students in ways that will help them in the future greatly. These activities can help students find out their interests. When they join different types of extracurricular activities, they can figure out what they enjoy doing, and what they are not interested in. This can lead to them finding their career path. By trying new things, they can find out what they are passionate about. Having tried different things and learned about them can also make a student stand out. If students continue to be apart of extracurricular activities in high school, it will help them get noticed by colleges. Extracurricular activities impact its students' futures for the better.

Making extracurricular activities required will positively influence students in many ways. They will help teach students skills that can help them for a lifetime. They will also give the students a more positive experience at school, and a better view of it. Lastly, extracurricular activities give them even more benefits that can help them in their near future. If students do not participate in extracurricular activities, so much talent and opportunities they could have had will go to complete waste.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear, Principal

I strongly believe that more of my peers and your students should help out with our community. By doing that it help our community prosper. Help raise students grades go up. Also, it will help our community help each other through hard ships.

By making the all of the students help with community services. It will help our community be converted into a prosperous community. Where every one has a job and to get them through this sturdy economy. All of the teens will have responsibilities and a job so they will have experience to get a job and keep that job.

It will also help my peers and your students get their grades up. This volunteering or job may count as credits or make your resume look sophisticated . So I acknowledge you to make them be part of the community so they will grow up to be successful.

This out of the ordinary idea will our community come closer through thick or thin. If one family loses a job the community will help or make a fundraiser dedicated to them. Instead of leaving them to suffer. By making this idea work all of the people in the community will feel comfortable around each other and help each other.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am going to tell you why you should make it your duty to have the children at our school do community services. I think we should perform at least a required fifteen hours of community service minimum for each quarter. If we each do a part in making our community better for only fifteen hours four times a year I believe it to be a possibility for our streets to become cleaner and less gang affiliated. I not only mean us student but the employees of SCHOOL_NAME too. The more the better and if not how about just extra credit or something. I'm sure that many people here wouldn't mind helping the homeless or cleaning up the sides of the Highway and the Boulevard. There are many people that would back me up so for our great town of California have your decision not be held on not to do it because it would take to much time or be to hard to see the students time cards or whatever they need to be signed. Decide yes because it is the right thing to do.

"I, think for one of my that we should keep, the old methods are founding fathers have created. The Electoral college has work for hundreds of years. Sure it has some flukes in the system but many can be buffered. Some problems can be fix, but we deffinitaly don't need to switch it up. for the Electoral College each party is eqaul in the race for president. Each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen from by the candidates political party, the states vary on how they are to be selected. You help choose your stat's elector when you vote for president,  really because you vote for your candidate you really are actually voting for your candidate selected electors. After these few steps in the Electorical College once all the voting is settled a Certifcate of Ascertainment also declares the winning predsidential candidate in your state at a meeting in December of election year. The certificate is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of offical records to the presidential election, then you wait.

Now, some people disagree with me on not keeping the old method. Some people thing now is a good time to start a new way, or tradition. many people of the US also thing that there are many flukes in the Electorial College. quoted "" At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters "". I strongly disagree with that quote because the voter no matter what is voting for there side. Weather they are voting for democrate, or republican the vote goes to an elector and then brought to state, which goes in as a vote for presidence. another quote released "" It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". Now how is that qouted true when for years the Electorial College has worked everytime.

Finally, the reasons on why we should keep the same method. The reasons on why we should keep these methods in general. These reasons are Certainty of Outcome, Swinging States, Big States, and the Avoidence  of Run-Off elections. All these reasons are valid reasons on why we should keep the sam method. Certainty of outcome we always have and outcome and rarly a problem. We have swinging states which gives each candidate a equal fight. Also big states in which can cause can great break through for a candidate if they win the state over. These are all valid reasons on for why we should keep the electorial college going.

"Hellow, my name is Luke Bomberger and I would like too share with you the experience I had as being a Seagoing Cowboy. Do you like helping people,visiting sites,and caring for animals? Then this might be that right job for you. When a first heard about it I was interested in becoming one of many Seagoing cowboys. As a Seagoing Cowboy you have a lot of responsibilates. One responsibilate is you will be a member of the UNRRA. You will also get to visit a lot of contries on you way there and you will get to see there land marks. Then as a Seagoing Cowboy you will also have to take care of the animal that you wil be shipping overseas to there destination.

At first it sound wierd to be called a Seagoing Cowboy but if you like site seeing and going to places you have never been before then this job is just right for you. When I went I sall the Acropolis in Greece and I also rode on a Gondola in Venice,Italy throgh the street water. If these place sound good imagen all the places you could visit if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

In addition to going to places you have never been before you also get the chance of helping people that's homes are in ruins due to World War 2. There is and organization called the United Nation Relief and Rehabilitation Administration which is also known as (UNRRA). This organization helps contries recover animals,food suplies and more. 44 nation join together to help these contries in need. So if you want to help these contries than becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is the right jod for you.

Also if you like animal this is the right place for you to be. Me and my friend help animal by getting young cows or mules shipped overseas. One day we had to boared 355 horses and enough food to feed then all to get there. We helped by returning them to a place that they can live in that is not in ruins. In addition to visiting place you will also be able to take care of animal as you ship them overseas.

I also hope that if you do become a Seaging Cowboy that you injoy your experience, I now that I sure did.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Exploring Venus is a worthy puruit despite the danger it presents because

""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""

This quote is important because there most likely would have been ways Venus could sustain some sort of life. If Venus really had oceans and ways of supporting life we can study Venus and maybe find out what happened to it to prevent it from happening to Earth. If we find a way to get to another planet and study it why wouldn't we?

In the third paragraph of the article it explains the harsh environment of Venus which should all be taken into consideration when thinking about Exploring Venus, and in five and seven it explains possible ways to safely explore and study Venus. Paragraph six explains how we cannot simply just orbit around Venus to study it because the gas and chaotic nature of the planet it too thick for cameras and any video to be taken so we would have to go to the surface and to do so we can use mechanical computers which can survive the harsh environment since it doesn't rely on electronics.

In conclusion Venus is the only planet in our solar system that is almost identical to us it could have had the ability to sustain life many years ago but now it's environment is extremely dangerous and any kind of research would be hard to do. There is a new idea to get to the surface of venus for more than a few hours and that is mechanical technology because of it's mechanical nature it can last longer than electronics on the surface which would give researchers a chance to study venus. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because before it was a chaotic planet with a dangerous environment it could have been just like Earth. Venus might have had oceans and because of the craters we have seen it could have also had mountains and different types of scenery.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I think I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I do not think it is a good idea to use this on humans without their consent. Technology is important but I still do not think this is a good idea.

Using this on humans isn't a good thing. If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it. How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy. What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.

Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor but how far would it modify it. Also if this became a thing would it take the place of teachers. If so than that would be a bad thing. So many people would lose their jobs. It says that it would be able to tell if I am confused which is a good thing. That way I wouldn't have to ask the teacher to come help me. They would just know and come help me, but I still think it is a bad idea.

I'm just not sure that it is a good idea to have something that reads emotion. I feel like some things that are better off covered up will be uncovered. Technology will consume our world if we are not careful.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"There are many things that people think the Face on mars is. You however, think that the face was created by aliens. We have gathered a lot of evidence on this and here is why you are wrong.

In paragraph 12 it says, ""What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" So if it really was an ancient alien artifact then that mean that aliens have been here as well. Along with all of the pictures we have aquired if there was a civilization we would have been able to see at least some of the remains in the pictures. But we have not.

Paragraph eight however, says, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Though this could be true, we have better quality pictures now than we did then and there are no alien markings shown. With the quality of the pictures we have now we can zoom in and it still looks fairly close to how it looks at normal size, and there are no markings.

In paragraph seven it tells us once more that, yet again, it is a natural landform. But people are not satisfied with that answer. In paragraph five conspiracy theorists say that it's bona fide, or evidence of life on Mars. They say that NASA would rather hide this information but people who work for NASA wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Would they seriously hide this kind of information from the public? No, because it would get them money and this would possibly be a world changing discovery.

So, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landmark. It has been proven that it is a landmark and nothing more several times. If you don't believe me then fine. But I really think you should just hang this one up for now.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Do you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing on an assignment or don't know where to start and you have nobody to help you?

Teachers should not allow students to design their own projects over the summer because if a student designs the project they would not know what to do and be unorganized, it's more efficient for the teacher to assign and grade, and finally teachers can assign you topics you have already went over in class. However, some may not agree on this position. Some points to take in consideration are that not all students will like the topic and may not know a lot on that specific that's assigned.

Firstly, when starting a new project students may not know what to do. For example, in my Vietnamese class I was assigned a project that was on Vietnam's geography. I was very confused on it because we had to do it on our own without any help or an outline. I didn't know where to start, where to find the information, or how choose a suitable location.

In addition, it is more efficient for the teacher to assign and grade. For instance, if your teacher gave you the opportunity to do your own project it would be very difficult to organize. The teach would have to create individual rubrics because every student will most likely have a different type of project. It would also be hard for the teacher because the teacher has to deal with a variety of different topics.

Consider this as an example, teachers can assign you with topics they went over in class. An example of this would be if a teacher assigned you a project based on a topic that you've already went over it would be a lot easier for you to accomplish and understand.

In conclusion, it is better for teachers to design projects for students because if a student designs a project they would not know what to do, it is more efficient for teachers to assign and grade, and finally teachers can assign project that you've already went over in class. Students should prefer teacher-designed based projects because it's less work for them and the teacher.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"We know it wasn't created by aliens! If it was then we could have seen it in every picture we took. Instead we could only see in in the picture in 1976. Also if we would have thought that it actually was a atrifact from aliens then we wouldnt have made it public right away we would have went to go get more information, but the public wasnt satisfied so we went back and got them the information they wanted. Last but not least when we went back in April 8, 2001 (on a cloudless day) and took a picture it clearly showed that it was not built by alien lifeforms.

When the pictures were took they were all taked in different time periods. In each picture they were different. In the first picture the face is clearly shown but we didnt get a clear enough picture, so we went back a second time to see take another one. In the second picture it is slightly hard to determened if the face is there or not. So of course we still werent satisfied, and yet again on April 8, 2001 we sent ANOTHER ship so take ANOTHER picture, i need to remind you this is on a cloudless day, and when the (multiple) pictures were taken, it was just some old hill with nothing special to it.

A few days after recieving the picture NASA made it public! If we had truly thought that this was a ""Acient Artifact"" we would have kept it secret and not relised it publicly until after we (knew) that it was created by aliens. Which shows that we always knew it wasnt a alien artifact after all.

I can see why most people had thought it was a acient alien artifact though. I mean most people dedicate their life finding out if there is more lifeforms out there. So most people had to have hope. For the sake of what they chose to do with there life.

In April 8, 2001 NASA went back to snap ANOTHER photo. This day (to remind you) was a cloudless day. So we knew it would be the perfect day to snap the finishing photo. The photo that would settle everything. Not long after the photo was snapped NASA recieved it, and for some it was satisfying to find out that it wasn't a acient alien artifact. Others (on th other hand) were devistated (for the same reason in paragraph 3). The debate was over it, was and is official that it wasn't a acient alien artifact.

Now do you understand? Have i finaly conviced you that it isnt and never was a alien life form. The facts i found in the article are pretty spot on to what happened so i hope i have finaly conviced you that its nothing special just a natural landform.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students which is a good thing because students can benefit from learning at home. If they are getting bullied in school they can stay at home and learn, if they have something wrong with their body they can still learn from home, and you can make your own food and eat the food you have available to you at home instead of school lunch. These are only some out of the many benefits for students that go to school and want to have an education but struggle to do so because of school.

First, some students in school get picked on and bullied for no reason, which can lead to very bad health problems. So, instead of the student moving schools or having their parents pay for them to go to a private school. The student can do distance learning, which allows them to still get an education from their own room. With being able to distance learning they can avoid all of the people that bullied the student and make them feel better about themselves.

Secondly, there are always students that get into a bad accident which causes them to have a bad injury. For example, a student breaks their leg and struggles to use the crutches and doesn't want to go to school. The student can simply stay at home instead of stressing their leg out and just take online classes. Therefore, they won't have to be in as much pain from their body while trying to learn in school. If they can't do online classes and decide to stay home they will miss out on the lessons being taught in school by teachers. Distance learning should be available to any student because it can be very beneficial to the student.

Third of all, some students do not enjoy school food and will go the whole day without eating because they think it is nasty, which leaves them to stay hungry for 7 hours of the day until they get home. When taking distance learning, your parents can go grocery shopping for the student and get them the food they desire. The student will then be able to make their own food and enjoy it instead of waiting all day to get home just to eat. Eating good can make a student be more productive throughout the day and strive to do more work for school. Also, while they are learning or doing work the student can grab themselves a snack while they learn and won't have to worry about disrupting anyone since they will be at home learning on their own.

Finally, Schools offering distance learning would be very beneficial to students if they are having a hard time in school. Distance learning would let the students be able to avoid bullying, be able to do school work at home if they are having issues with their body, and they can make their own food at home which would be more enjoyable for them than what the school serves for lunch. There are many other ways that distance learning can benefit a students life and make them feel much better than going to school everyday. Every school should offer something like distance learning to help out the students that they have enrolled to their school because you may never know what is going on in their personal life.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In the years of 1976, a spacecraft snapped photographs for possible sites for the Viking 2 to land. In the photo that was taken, a fairly large head-looking object that was nearly 2 miles long was on the Red Planet. This caused many people to believe; What if there's life on Mars? It seems like a head but i strongly believe it is just a natural landform.

Scientists have proved that the theories of the object being a sign of life was highly unlikely. However when it comes to consipiracy theories, people are very stubborn to believe them without any proof. The scientists figured that it was simply a mesa which is pretty common around there except according to the text, ""-this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Later, the image was unveiled and it certainly caught a lot of attention!

Since it caught a lot of people's attention, it soon starred in a Hollywood film, was in books, magzines, and radio talk shows according to the text. This would obviously cause more people to believe it is a sign of life on Mars, since it went so viral. But the thing is is that it is not evidence of life, yet so many say it is. It has not been scientifically proven. NASA themsleves have said that it is just a natural landform. Also, movies, magazines, and books overexaggerate things so they really aren't evidence.

I believe it is a landform just like any other. Here on Earth, we have plenty of landforms. According to the text, scientists have said that landforms are very common around there, specifically Martian mesas. Coincidentally, this landform just so happened to be shaped like a head. There are plenty of landforms and other objects that look like other objects. Here on earth we could have a rock shaped like a heart or a pond shaped like a nose.

I also believe that it is just the people's imagination that leads them to believe this. Sometimes our imaginations and theories can't always be correct. There are plenty of conspiracy theories out there. I believe that if you do not have solid evidence for such theories, don't believe them.

On April 5, 1998, the object was proven to be a natural landform which proved some scientists wrong about their theories about it being an alien monument. It was proven by the Mars Global Surveyor which flew over Cydonia to check on the unusual object. This proves that there is no life on Mars and that the ""face"" is just a natural landform.

According to the text, it really is the Martian equivalent of a mesa or a butte which are common around the American West. So this concludes my argumentative essay on why I believe the Face is just a natural landform.                   ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Have you ever had an opportunity to go to europe and help people in need?

First,some reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program are, getting discoverd. For example,if your 18 like I was you could be drafted for military service which means you would be able to help the world and have a great job. Another reason, you should join is because,you can discover some amazing things. For example, you could see places like europe,china,italy and greece. Also you will be helping a lot of people and animals because,you will be doing things for the benefit of there need. All of these examples show reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.

Next,but for me being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure.''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Just like it made me look at the world diffrent it might be the same to you or even an acheivment you have accomplished. Their are some reasons you might be scared to go. For example you might be scared of failing or being flown over board. But as long as you stay together with the person your with and do what your supposed to you wont fail.

Another good reason of going to the seagoing cowboys program is helping people. World war 2 was over in europe and many countries were left in ruins and if you want to help all the people in ruins you could join the seagoing cowboys program. UNRRA hired the ''seagoing cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. So from what the UNRRA said that means you probly would be getting paid. Even if you dont get paid its still a good thing to do to help people that need help. All of these reasons state why this is a good reason to join the program.

In conclusion,all these reasons I have stated will really help people. Helping is what the seagoing cowboys program is about and it will make you more aware of things like other countries in need. If your not 18 yet and you want to be drafted for military service join more than once because, the more you join the more your helping the people,animals,and enviorment. I hope from all the reasons I have given you,you'll join the seagoing cowboys program.        ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"There are endless opportunities and unique activities for teens to engage in at school. You can find art clubs, music, English, sports, and more amazing activities. These lists are endless to one persons desire. Activities are supposed to be fun entertaining, enjoyable, and relaxing. Anybody can find a club that fits their personality, and at the end of the day makes them a better person. These activities might even lead you to new friends, and a new passion that you would possible want to pursue latter in your life. That is why I agree with the principal, students should participate in an extracurricular.

If you are in middle school and love sports, but can't play yet, you can manage the sport of your choice. Managing is a great way for middle school athletes to get involved. You can meet the coaches, hangout with the team, help set up different drills, and participate in the sport you love. You also get to interact with many people who share the same interest as you. On game days you can ride the bus with the team and even help with games! Managing is a way for you to get to know the coaches,and the game to a better understanding while having fun, and once you are in high school you will know some of your teammates already. Other sport activities are optional to, like training . You can work with some of the high school coaches and get designed training for that specific sport. These are only a few of many great activities for teens to do.

Theater is a huge way to interact with your school. If you decide to so theater you can make skits, and even big plays. theater is an amazing way to interact with people. you can be whoever you want to be, and as loud as you can be. Middle school theaters put on plays like Harry Potter, Cinderella, Cat in the Hat, and some original plays. If you want to be in a play you have to audition . When rehearsals begin you stay after school every day with the cast. Being in theater is awesome, you get to hang out with your friends and make an awesome play for the school to see. Theater is a great way to work with your community. You do projects with your friends on making signs to put around the area so people know what play is going to be preformed. The cast is not the only people working on the play. If you dont enjoy being on stage you can be on the stage crew. stage crew is very crucial to theaters. If you like to work with tech you can work with the lights and sound. If you like art you can paint the set, and if you dont like any of those you can be somebody who folds brochures and makes fliers, or a bouncer,somebody who opens doors and make sure the play runs smoothly.

I have just listed some activities that are really popular. Any activities are good activities though. Instead of going home you could enjoy the thrill of sports, or the relaxation of painting. It is good to get one activity in per year. The extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and relaxing to students. All activities are given to us so we get a break and get to have fun with whatever we are doing. Not all of them are classes, in fact most of them are different categories of activities so everyone finds on that fits their personality. The principal has a good reason to make students do these activities. Although you might not be thrilled about staying after school, at the end of whatever you are doing you will be happy you did.

Although you might think extracurricular activities are boring. You will most likely find on you enjoy. These activities are important to get involved in. There are hundreds of activities you can get involved in. One activity is all it takes to find your passion,weather it is sports, art, or theater. Participating in one extracurricular is a great thing for all students to do. Instead of sitting down and doing nothing or going home and doing homework for hours you can take a break from all the stress and relax with your friends. Not all schools have the money or opportunities to make any of these extracurricular's happen, so why not at least do one.   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Should we keep our method of choosing the president? If so there's 3 reasons for why we should: we would have certainty of an outcome, states will have equal voting rights, and we would avoid run-off elections. Those are just a few good reasons for why we should keep our method for choosing a president the same.

The certainty of an outcome will always be there in the Electoral College. Even when a canidate receives more votes than other candidates while not receiving a clear majority of votes.  There could always be a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote but that wouldn't mean that there couldn't be an outcome. Even though there's a very rare chance of there being a tie in the outcome since theres 538 votes there would still be an outcome.

Even though the bigger states should have more voting rights than the smaller states it's equal for a couple reasons. They all get Electoral votes, but the large states get more attention then the smaler states because they have more electoral votes then the smaler states do. It also restores the political balance upon states.

We could also avoid run-off elections by keeping the same method. If you win the majority in Electoral votes then there's pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That's why we have our nation to vote for the president, because they effect the matter alot just by putting in one vote.

Those are just a few reasons for why we should keep the same method for choosing the president it's by the outcome and the votes. The reason for why we let our nation choose is because we like for them to be involved with who controls them in every wich way. That's just a few reasons for why we choose the president the method for the method that we use.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody. We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime

Many student don't like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I don't think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they don't pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life.

Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you.

For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe

This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience.

In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more. Study is more important, the place is not important beacuse when the person want to be someone like a professional in the future they need study much.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"We live in a world where transportation is a must and most of the people around the world rely on themselves to get from A to B. Don't get me wrong there are some that choose public transportation opposed to privet/self transportation. They both have something in common, both are adding more pollution to the air, car accidents have the number one death rate, and they both add to taxes. Many countries are comeing up with a solution to all of these problems. Most countries are wanting to cut down the amount of automobiles their citizens are using on a day to day basis. Here are some reasons this could be benificial to you! Cutting down the amount of automobiles being used on a daily basis would take less money out of yor pocket and would be better for the enviroment, and it would be healthier and safer.

More and more countries are taking action to stop the large amout of cars being used daily. One way they are doing this is by having car-resticted areas, like in Vauban, Germany, ""Vauban streets are completely car-free..."", (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal). By doing so, you wouldnt use your car very often or at all. This will reduced the amout of money you will have to spend on gas, car repair, or it could cut out the cost of buying a car entirely. More and more people will not have a need to buy/use a car and that will be extremely benificial to the Earth. This is because their will be less pollution and smog being produced by the running cars. Pairs, France is a big contributer to smog and they are now reducing the amount of allowed cars on their roads, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party..."",(Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog,Robert Duffer). Paris has now lowered the amount of smog in their cities signifigantly.

With less pollution and smog life for the people will be a lot healthier. Just think about how much cleaner the air will be. Also, by not using a car you could walk or bike to your destinations and that will also be very benificial to your health. By not using cars, public thransportation, or just staying off the road in general you are cutting out the risk of being in a deathly car accident. By doing so life will be much safer. You will also cut out the stress and worry of driving. ""...When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,..."", (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal).

In the end, cutting down the amount of car and public transportation being used will be very benificial to everyone of all ages because it will take less of your money to get to your destinations and will cause less pollution which is better for the Earth, and it is much safer to be off the road ,as well as, healthier to walk or bike to your destinations.

"I agree. Because students have too much spare time. During the spare time that they have they could be participating in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. In the spare time they have they could be doing something negative and could get in a lot of trouble. The principle is trying to give them something positive to do in their spare time. They don't have to actually have to participate in sports or work on the yearbook, they can have extra work to do or they can study but that's not enough time to keep the busy during the whole day after school. If they participate in sports they'll have practice after school, then after practice they will most likely have homework. If they were to participate in the school council they may have to stay after school for meetings. The principal is trying to have the students busy at all times.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Making choices in life can be very difficult. People often ask for advice when they can not decide on one thing. It's always good to ask others for their advice when making a choice. When you have multiple opinions you have the ability to make the best choice for yourself. Seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice because it can decrease stress levels, a great chance to learn something new, can be very helpful and beneficial.

To begin with, Seeking information from more than one person can decrease stress levels. When making a decision there is a chance that you can become very stressed and overwhelmed. Being stressed can cause a person to give up on what they are doing. Having multiple opinions from people can make choosing an option less difficult and more easier. The information that you receive from others may have a special meaning in the future. Other peoples opinion can make a person feel confident in making the right choice.

When you ask other people for their opinion you can also learn many new things. Everyone is different and may have more experience than you. Seeking other peoples opinion can cause you to gain a new skill or lesson. For example, someones advice could teach you how to do something the correct way. Many people are very different and have experience different things in life. Seeking advice from others can teach you a lot. We all learn from our mistakes in life, by sharing your past experiences you may prevent someone else from making the same mistake.

Seeking others opinion can be very helpful and beneficial. Taking other peoples advice and doing what they say may lead to a great outcome. When you receive other opinions whether they are good or bad you will be able to look at them from a different point of view. For example, When a group of people give you advice on yourself, you then know how they look at you as a person. Everyone looks at certain things from a different prospective. How someone else looks at it may be how its supposed to be viewed in life.

In conclusion, You can learn from others experiences by seeking the advice that someone give you. Making decisions can cause stress on a person. Relating to someones advice may higher your self-esteem because you no longer feel left out. Ask others for advice when making a difficult decision. When you seek others opinion more opportunities are available fro yourself. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I agree that students should take their cell phones to school and be able to use them during lunch periods and other free times. The cell phones will have to be off during class but in our free times we could use them. I think they should let us because i think its a great way to refresh your mind a little and then go back to work.

I would say also that bringing a cell phone to school is okay because we wont be using them during class only on free times. It would be better if they would let us bring cell phones to school because when a student is bored they can always refresh their mind by using their cell phones on their lunch period or their free times. That way if we bring cell phones and they don't let us students might be using their cell phones during class and their not going to be paying attention to the teacher. And if we knew that we could bring cell phones we wouldn't be using our cell phones behind the desk so that the teacher doesn't catch us. If we do that because we know we cant bring any cell phones to school we are going to be on our cell phone and we are not going to be paying attention to the teacher about what she's teaching us. If we knew that we could bring cell phones we would just wait for our lunch period to use them or on our free times. That way we could be paying attention to the teacher and not using our cell phones because we know that we could use them on our lunch period or free times.

Another reason i think we should be able to bring cell phones to school is that if we bring cell phones to school and we cant bring them we are going to get in trouble for using our cell phones and not paying attention to the teacher. Also if we don't pay attention to the teacher we wont be able to understand the work or the homework she gives us and we wont do it because we don't understand it. If we don't do our work or our homework we are going to get bad grades and our grades are going to go down. That's my other reason why i think we should be able to bring cell phones instead of bringing them when we cant and be using them in school. Most of the students that have cell phones would like to bring them to school and some do so they can be using them when the teacher is not looking at them. Another reason that they should let us bring cell phones to school is so that we wont have to be scared that the teacher might catch us and get in trouble for it. When we know we could bring cell phones to school we could just bring them off and during our lunch period or free time we can turn them on and use them without fearing that the teacher is going to catch you using it when your not supposed to. More reasons are that if you have your cell phone on during class and you forgot to put it on silent if it rings or something the teacher can catch you right away and might take your cell phone then she would tell your parents you have it and they need to go get it.

These are my reasons to say that they should let us bring cell phones to",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a recent advancement in technology that can read emotions from facial expressions. Many people speculate where it could be used, from marketing to video games. Some might wonder whether it could be used in classrooms, which is a definitive ""No."" FACS is not valuable to read student's emotional expressions because the classroom shouldn't include emotion, it has better uses elsewhere, and is invasive of privacy.

Emotion shouldn't dictate the lesson in schools. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto quotes, "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" (6). Everyone has walked into class one day, seen the lesson and then silently grumbled to themselves. This type of emotion shouldn't change what the lesson is or how it is taught. The goal of teaching techniques is to effectively teach the broadest audience. This type of system would switch up the lesson for the few people who get confused easily, but then it hurts the majority's learning experience. This is why the classroom shouldn't include emotion.

Systems such as FACS have better economical value elsewhere. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto says, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" (6). This is one example of other industries that could utilize this type of technology. In the classroom, there is no economical value of being able to read the students emotions. Mr. D'Alto goes on to say, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery."" These are other industries that would love FACS-like technology. It's a better investment to use FACS elsewhere other than the classroom.

Privacy is held dear by many. FACS can be invasive of this. Some students may wish to save their grief for a counselor, therapy, or simply a designated time to cry. FACS completely disrespects this fact and exposes an individual to everyone else. In the passage, D'Alto quotes, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, uncluding emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too.' "" (6). This quote implies that computers are not yet able to comprehend whether or not the individual wishes to be ""scanned"", for a lack of a better term. This can be invasive. Until technology reaches a point until this changes, FACS should stay out of the classroom where students may not wish to have their emotions expressed involuntarily.

In conclusion, FACS is not only worthless, but harmful to the learning quality of students. This is because it has better uses elsewhere, is a breach of privacy and includes emotion into the classroom. FACS is, and may never be suitable for a classroom environment.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear principle,

The cell phone use policy's have come to my attention.

Your students use their phones almost every period.

Your cell phone rule in place right now is not working. The kids get away with texting in class and it is distracting to their work which lowers their grades.

The policy in place right now is that your students can bring their phone to school, but they have to have it turned off.

The kids use their phones anyway.

When you tell them not to use their phones, they are going to use them anyway.

If you tell them they could use their phones at lunch and during their free time they will not use them as much, during class.

Your students grades are dropping and it is because of the cell phone use during class.

Policy number two will be the best policy for your students.

It show them you trust them a lot more and if they need to call their parents that is the time to do it instead of going to the bathroom to call them.

Trust me, I'm a student.

Sincerely,

Your

"when getting advice i believe you should ask more then one person. Asking more then one person can really help you get a better opinion on what your asking or need advice on. A good reason to ask more then one person their opinion when asking for advice is maybe they know more then you, they could have a different opinion on your topic, and they could have more reasons then you on why you should do something one way or they other or agree or disagree with your topic.

Sometimes when taking advice you should ask someone older then you. Because they are older then you they could probably give you better reasons to make a better choice. Asking your parents for advice would be great because theyÃÂ´ve been your age before so they know how to act in the situation. Also asking your teachers would be a good group of people to ask for advice from because they are very smart and more educated then then you are

Asking more then one person on their opinion could be very helpful if you are doing research. Because if they have a different opinion it could possibly be better then your opinion and make more since. Or in some cases if you ask different people you could change their opinion to agree with you. Sometimes you can have the same opinion as someone but have different reasons to agree with the topic, so you could give them more reasons to make a better choice and they could give you better reasons to make a better choice.

With some cases people could agree with you but have better reasons then you on a topic. sharing your opinions with different people could make them agree more with your topic then they already do. If you are arguing one side of a opinion but donÃÂ´t have many reasons talking to more people could give you more and even better reasons to agree with one side of an argument or topic. But if you have the same reasons as them you could probably come up with better reasons to agree with one side of the topic that will encourage others to agree with your side.

I believe getting out in the world and putting your opinion out to others about a topic would help people agree with what you wanting advice on or agree with the topic you are agreeing with. Also asking for advice from people can help you get better reasons for people to agree with you. Plus if you ask for advice it can help you do thing the right way instead of the wrong way. For example if you are working on a car or building a house or even a school project advice can go a long way to help you because advice can teach you to do it the correct way or help you with something you messed up on. ThatÃÂ´s why advice is important to me and i believe it is a good thing. Do you think advice is good or bad?",0,persuade_corpus,1
"One topic that is frequently debated is whether or not students should attend to classes from home by way of online. Some people think that students would not learn as good as they want them to learn by taking classes at home online. They feel that the teachers have to be teaching, explaining, and responding questions person-to-person to understand even faster. I believe that students would actually focus even more by taking classes at home because most of the them have jobs, expensives, and family to support.

One reason why attending classes from home online is it important is because students have another life besides school. Students would barely spend time at home. Students have to make their own choices, their own things, and their own path in order to have a successfully future. The majority of the students work a bunch of hours and get off from work very late. They would not like to wake up early to go to school the next day.

Another reason why is because students need to pay their expensives. They have the necessity to buy things as well, to pay their bills, food, and rent. Students would neither be able to achieve their goals, nor have a pacefull life without any struggle if they don't pay their expensives. In order to have a life out of debts, they must work for their necessities.

The final reason why is because some students have their families back in their countries. They support them and they also give them an economic aid. The more money they make, the better it is because not only their parents help them, but them. We are a diversity of students and each one of us have different reasons, purposes, and persuits.

As you read, everyone think differently and have different reasons. Only when we know our responsabilities, our effort, and our situation; we will realize that some of us need an opportunity to succeed on our own way. Our families will be proud of us. On that day our society will become good and the world will be a better place to live.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"When Nasa discovered this ""face"", at first they didn't know what to say. So they just passed it as another ""Martian Mesa"". ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Eighteen years later after the Viking space trip, they decided to take more photos of it. The technology improved so it was giving them a clearer image. They got the pictures, and soon put them out for the public to see. ""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars"". Thousands of people that were waiting for this image soon saw it was just a landform, ""JPL website, revealing...a natural landform, There was no alien monument after all"". Then later they figured out that the picture was acually a butte or mesa. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West"".

"Students should be able to choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not for many reasons. Most students are busy and don't want added pressure on top of school work. While kids may want to do extraculliculars they may do out of school activities that can take up their time, or they might have a family to take care of. Many students also a lot of time for homework, which they won't get the time for in an extracurricular.

A reason students student's may not want to do an extracurricular is because they might have out of school obligations. If a student was babysitting or tutoring someone, they wouldn't have time to do extraculliculars because they'd be busy doing another job. It would be unfair to force someone who has another job to do more work, which is why they should have the choice to do an extracurricular activity.

Furthermore, some students could have a family to take care of when they get home. For example, if a student has a younger sibling that needs to be picked up from the bus stop, the student would have to help with that. If they were forced to do an extracurricular, they wouldn't have time to take care of their sibling.

In addition, quite a few students would need more time to do homework, which an extracurricular would prevent them from doing. While some students can finish their homework quickly and have enough time for another activity, a student who takes a long time shouldn't be rushed into doing something else. If they need more time to do their homework, they shouldn't be dragged into doing an activity.

In conclusion, students have out of school activities, family to take care of, and a lot of homework which can make it hard for them to focus on extracurricular activities on top of it. All in all, there are many reasons a student might not want to do an extracurricular. Because of this, a student should be able to have a choice to do another activity or not.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Once there was a period in my life when I was to scared to ask anyone for advice,

I was stuburn and only wanted to do things my way.

But through my expireances I now know that it is best to get advice from multiple people because well some people are older and wiser, also someone you trust would give great advice, and finally its just good to have more than one opinion to choose from.

As you get older and go through life you get more wise and knowlageable.

When ever I need advice I tend to also ask my parents, grandparents and even friends parents.

Because I know that they have been through more than I have and are likely to have good advice on what I am looking for.

Older siblings could be a great option too because they went through school and have been stressed about school work and they know how to deal with that stuff.

For example last year I was reall stressed about my math sol so I asked my sister for advice and she told me don't worry about if you pass or not just know that you did your best and thats all that matters.

Most people when they need advice they don't go to a random stranger for advice because you don't know or trust them so how do you expect to believe what they tell you.

People you trust are more than likely to trust you too and want the best for you and your life so they will give you the best advice they can provide.

You can also build bonds with people and keep going back to them for advice. My sister and I have build a really strong bond and we trust each other with anything from advice on school work to even advice on drama and stuff like that.

If you don't trust the person giving you advice then you don't know if they are giving you the best advice.

If you don't get more than one opinion you just have one to choose from and you may not think its the best for you.

But if you get multiple then you can choose the best one for you.

Also some people don't give the best advice for what you are looking for.

Some people are better at giving advice than others and once you find the best option for you, you can go with that.

For instance a few years back I asked someone for advice and they didn't know what was best for me but something that they said has stuck with me since don't be scared to go out of you confort zone and ask a school conceler or someone that you are close with.

When some people ask for advice they sometimes go to more than 1 person.

Askng multiple people could help in many ways to seek the best choice for you.

If you go to people that are wiser and elder have more expieriance, people you know and trust and finally its good to have more than one opinion to choose from. When I was younger I was pretty dumb for not seeking advice but now that Im older and more mature I know its best to seek multiple people for advice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear, Senator

Keeping the Electoral college is a bad idea to do. We should not have leave up to the electors to make the final vote. The Electoral College system has the votors vote but not for the president, but for the slate of electors, that then turns and elect the president off of there own votes.

As a soon to be voter it will be better to let the voters make the desion on who our president should be. All Americans should have the choice of saying who going to be president over us for the 2 or 4 years. I dont feel Electoral College is needed in this case. votes need to be taking with the population of votes that are sumitted by us the voters.

The Electoral College was a good idea that we had been using. It consists of 538 electors but 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Less electors need to needed and more of the population vote needs to be added in to the final election.

After learning all the things i didnt know it was very interesting. I really think that by using our population vote will be a better thing to do. The Electoral College seems like a very dificult process. Hopefully one day you will change this process of how the president gets elected.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Would you like to have help at school with out even having to ask for it. A resorce that could read emotions would and is voluable in school today so kids can get the best out of learning. Technology is getting so good that it can now read emotions. In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile.'' Nick D'Alto talks about how computer solfware can help people with problems just by sencing there face emotions. Technology that is able to, identify mixed emotions, scietificly proven and tested to work, and helps in school, Should be put in all schools.

First off, technology that can identify mixed emotions is a great tool in school and every ware. For exampel it could help stop peolpe in court rooms or when you are talking to a offeser. It can tell what persont of feelings you have. It said that the Mona Lisa ""... 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" (Pg.1)

This would help with identifying mixed emotions.

Secondly, It has been scientificly proven to work because Thomas Huang,and Nicu Sebe both from high colloges working on ways that humans and computers can communicate. They stared of with a ""cumputer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""(Pg 3) They created ""FACS"" this classifies six basic emotions. ""...happiness, surprise, anger disgust, fear, and sadness..."" (Pg. 3) These are all emotions that students have and that could us help from a computer that cares.

Lastly, it would help with school. Kids could see a problem on the computer and give a confused look at it and it could pop up a screan with a help page or it could inform the teacher that you are haveing truble. Nick D'Alto stated "" for example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This would help at school so there could be less bad ad to pop up. This will help kids stay safe. If you have a problem and the computer could read your face it could modify that problem.

This would be a fantastic improvment in schools. It would help kid learn better and it could give teachers a break. It could even help istep graders. Computers in schools and all over the world should have face software because it knows unknow emotions, sceintest Thomas Huang and Nicu are proving it works, and it will help make kids life easyer in school.

"Some schools require students to complete projects over summer vacation. The reason that many schools do this is to ensure that the student is somewhat engaged academically so they can return to school with a drive to learn. However, many students cannot bear the task of a project during the summer, as many want to be as far from teachers or school authority as possible over the 2-and-a-half month break. This pattern of avoiding summer projects could be fixed as quickly as a blink of the eye. These summer projects should be student-designed. These student-designed projects would be much more beneficial because students would be self-motivated to complete the project, and the student would have much more fun completing the project due to the fact that it is designed by the student.

When being told by someone else to do something, more times than not can decrease a person's will to actually complete the task asked of them. This is why many students sometimes fall behind on classwork or struggle in school in general, because they lose the motivation to complete the task due to someone else giving them a designated time to complete work. When people set their own goals, they tend to work harder and want to get the best score possible. This is called self-motivation, and you need to be self-motivated in life to complete tasks. However, people are normally more self-motivated when they set goals for themselves. If students were able to design their own summer-projects, they would actually be self-motivated to complete the task at hand. Also, it would give the student a higher sense of achievement knowing that they picked their own project and worked hard to complete it.

Everyone knows that self-motivation is the key aspect to complete tasks, however it is very hard to be self-motivated to complete a task you are not interested in. This is the biggest reason of why children and teenagers struggle in school. Many teenagers are just not interested in the topics that they learn about in school, thus decreasing their drive to work hard in school. Summer projects are no different, and are almost identical to the other examples given, except it is given in the summer. If a student wouldn't be interested in conquering the project in school, there is absolutely zero chance that the student would put their full effort into the project. That would be disastrous, the student would receive a bad grade and would hurt his/her chances of getting a good grade for the quarter, and would not properly prepare the student for the upcoming school year. If the student was passionate about the project, he/she would spend time completing the project, and would put 100% effort into what they were doing.

An assignment given by a teacher compared to a student-designed project has many different outcomes. A teacher-designed project would most likely not be beneficial due to the lack of effort given. A student-designed project would show the student's potential and would actually most likely be enjoyed by the student. These student-designed projects would be much more beneficial because students would be self-motivated to complete the project, and the student would have much more fun completing the project due to the fact that the topic is chosen by the student.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I agree with this decision. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe this because, students can have more fun, students can help the school, and students can have a better idea about what job they might want in the future.

Students are always in their classrooms learning and working. With an extracurricular activity apart of their schedule, students can have more fun at school! Students can enjoy themselves by participating in an extracurricular activity. It would be like having a break from their usual schedule.

Depending on what kind of extracurricular activity the student is involved in, students can help out with school fundraisers, donations, or the weekly school news. They can start fundraisers for the school by setting up advertisements. Students can do this by making posters or setting up fund raising websites. Students can also create short videos or newspapers to inform other students about certain events that will take place during the school weeks. Students can join school clubs to help with donations as well.

By participating in an extracurricular activity, a student can really start thinking about what kind of career they might want in the future. For example, if a student decides to play for the Prince George baseball team as an extracurricular activity, then he or she may want to become a professional baseball player. Students may also enjoy working on the school yearbook. By working on the school yearbook, they may consider becoming a photographer for their career. Therefore, having an extracurricular activity can make it easier for students to decide on a job they might want for their future.

In conclusion, students can have lots of fun when having an extracurricular activity to participate in. They can also help out the school with fundraisers, donations, or even school news. Extracurricular activities can really help students think of a future career. That is why I believe students must participate in an at least one extracurricular activity.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"What is the best method for a students education? Students will befit by being able to attend classes from home because students will have more options of class times, students will be less stressed, and students will have more personal time.

First, speaking from the point of view as a high school student or a college student, trying to find time for classes along with other activities can be difficult. Going to at least five or six classes a day, getting homework, then going to jobs or sports can be hard to manage, especially as a teenager. As a student if you are able to work from home and pick the time of your classes it may be more suiting to your schedule. As this type of activity is not made for everyone, it may find a way to be useful to every student such as the student can have classes when the teacher video calls the student or when the teacher has a planned class, while others may want to chose when this class happens and if it is by themselves or live with others. While any of these options are available students may even earn a better education at their own pace and their own time without the rush and stress of the surrounding world.

Next, a students stress level can go down by taking online classes. As today's modern society rises students have more mental issues than a mental patient in the 1920's. This is a very large issue that counties to grow, along with many other stressful events and even technology. Stress can cause many things like depression and anxiety, but how can schools help with this? While most high schools students worry about the future we want to find a way to help them stress less about these things. By giving the option to students of online classes, students are able to do what they want, when they want, and how they do it. This may allow students to become more open and not feel like they need to fight against others or themselves to be their best self. Students will be able to complete classes on their own time and learning does not have to be as difficult as it appears. By limiting big classes students may not be surrounded by others with a higher level than them and stress about how they are not good enough or need to be better in anyway.

Last, students would have access to more personal time. As mentioned before students will most likely have the option of when their classes are and when they do them, this can give the student more access to their own time and any activities. Students can focus on important things like sleep, health, jobs, and other activities then return to their school work at anytime and being able to feel comfortable with their choices without being told how and when to do them. Students having more time to relax or enjoy themselves without feeling the stress of school and homework on their chest gives the students the ability learn new things and test their minds on what they can really do.

By doing online class and giving students more choices and free time the student can learn time management skills and understand what needs to be done, when to get it, and how to complete these task daily.

In conclusion, students will befit by attending classes from home because students will have more options of class times and how they wish to mange their time and usage of the day. Students may become less stressed due to when given more options in schooling and learning on your own time at your own pace. Students will have access to more personal time and be able to learn new skills and enjoy themselves without the stress of the modern world.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"How having multiple opinions help people make better choices?

In my opinion I do think that having the right ideas others have displayed for you can result in you making very good decisions. While getting opinions from others it is very important to be able to have a strong mindset and make the right choice then have a mindset that isn't as strong and choosing some thing that could cause yourself harm and or failure. Only you can make the good decision that will come upon from the thoughts that you decided to choose to listen to. Then when you have made a choice on what you want to do will your actions speak along with your decision.

Once you obtain more than one person's perspective it is good to make a habit of hearing all the different point of views accessible to your needs. All the different views can lead you to new options and ideas. If you are open and willing to acknowledge more information as well as reasons from others on the prior situation it will help you out a lot. When you are given different aspects you are more liable to make a worthy response. With opinions you can achieve more than what you wanted by being open.

Although there are some really good ides that people will give you there are also bad ones that people will give, it is your right to be able to choose what you want and not have to worry about what other think or say, but choosing the option somebody wants you to choose and it is dangerous or wrong you shouldn't choose the idea. Why because having chosen that idea you are bringing harm along side yourself and others too. After you have made up your mind on what opinion you want to follow whether it's right or wrong you are responsible. If you choose the right opinion it will justify you more good then picking one that is not. You have a choice on the idea you will choose but the will lead to whether your decision is good or not.

In the process of making a decision or choice you want to be able to make the most reasonable one possible.

The path you choose can be hard to make but by making a list of the advantages and disadvantages will help to make sure your liability in the situation will right for you. Since seeking out opinions can be a help to you making sure that the process to your final answer is what you want is hard too, but making sure you have more pros than you do cons and you can agree that you like what is presented making a list can help make your last thought easier and safer too. The pros in the exhibited ideas can give more thoughts and so can the cons but only if you take responsibility and proceed to to use them for the right reasons.

In conclusion listening to other people's thoughts can help you make the right decision. Only if you choose the right opinions presented and don't get yourself in trouble or hurt. You are the only person who can make the right decision not anyone else hearing out other people's ideas doesn't mean that they are allowed to make your choices. The person who makes the design has the chance to take advice from others and use it hoe you want. But everybody has a entitlement to what they think and do with the options displayed to them but only they can make the right decision themselves. Therefore maybe considering my advice can help you make smarter decisions when it come to making your's.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Today the majority of people use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of us just can't put them down, not even when it can cause other people to be unsafe. We use them from when we wake up to when we finally go to sleep. But is there a time that we shouldn't be on our cell phones? When we're driving it is never a good idea to be on your phone.

The reason that its a bad idea to be on your phone during driving is that it takes away your attention from the road. Driving is already a multitasking operation. We have to balance our speed, gas level, directions, music, air conditioning, and other drivers. The last thing we need is another thing to focus on, especially an entertainment device that we already struggle to put down. All cell phones do for drivers is add another thing to focus on, and the list of things for drivers to focus on is already too long.

Another reason not to allow phones in the hands of drivers is that, although distraction is a large issue, even if you argue that you can pay attention and multitask well enough, your reaction time is still slowed. It has been proven that multitasking lowers a person's ability to act efficiently. This also applies to driving. Not only do you run the risk of missing a turn or passing that restaurant that you were looking for, you run a very large risk of not reacting soon enough to a distracted driver, running off of the road, and rear ending a stopping car. Your slowed reaction time is a very large issue when using cell phones while driving.

The reasons for not using cell phones while driving are very compelling and should not be taken lightly. Many people lose their lives every year due to distracted driving. It is important to stay very focused and aware while driving. Do not risk your safety or someone else's due to cell phone usage while driving.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"dear principal, 2-7-11

The b average requirement should not be revised. These extracurricular activities should only be allowed for the students who try the hardest in their classes. Those students have earned themselves this and shouldn't share them with people that have anything less than a b average. This is coming from a middle school student who takes algebra 1 in 8th grade and is recommended for English honors for high school next fall. That isn't pleased with a single b in any class that gets straight a' s.

A c average is required at my school for dances and other privileged things, I don't really care that a person that gets c' s or b' s has the rights that I'm entitled to because i know that i am very highly over them in academics and especially all sports.

"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should not require all students to perform some act of community service. I believe it is a choice rather to perform some act of community service or not. Someone should not be made to do what they wish to not. If students would like to have community service they than they can do that on their own time.

For example I do community service with my church. I had a friend along with me who had never been to church. I asked her if she would like to help me in the soup kitchen that Sunday afternoon. She just said that she was not in to community service and would rather go home, but said that she thought it was great that I was helping in the soup kitchen.

Another example was when my brother had some friends over from school. One of them had to leave so he could go help his mom clean up some elderly peoples homes. He asked my brother and the other friends if they would like to come. My brother replied and said ""sure that'd be fun"" but the other friends didn't want to so they just stayed at home until my brother was back.

With those people asking if others would like to help with community service it gave the others a chance to decide for themselves. I believe that people should not be forced to do something they wish not to do.

Therefore I hope that you do not require all students to perform some act of community service. For the students that would like to perform some act of community service there could be a group set up or every Wednesday they could go pick trash up off the highway, so that it is a way for people to make their own decisions on rather or not they would like to perform community service.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think the idea of having a principal making everyone in the school have to do community service is good, but I could be troubling for some people. There has to be a lot of thought put into making this decision, from the person making the decision and their point of view on it to the people that are going to be affected once the decision is made. All this will have to be thought out taking into consideration the type of community service that is going to be required to do .

Different types of community service require certain skills, transportation, and even tools. Helping out at a retirement home is a good way of showing your community support and that you care about all the people in your community but having the transportation to get to where you need to go in order to be able to help out can be a problem. Many of the kids in the school that will be participating in this event cannot drive on their own, they are brought to and from places by their parents. As willingly as this students maybe about helping out, their parents/guardian may not have the time to take them where they need to go. Parents are very busy, not only with their kids, but with work, and adding another thing for them to worry about might not be good. This could also get in the way of their schedule, but this isn't something that has to be done everyday, once a week, is better than nothing.

Community service is good in many ways. If students at a young age grow up with the act of helping others around them they will keep that with them for the rest of their life. Growing up helping people with small acts of kindness as simple as getting an elder person a glass of water, helping someone put in groceries, helping out serve food at a homeless shelter will make you a better person inside and out. By helping out others around you with small things can bring big rewards later on.

Other acts that can be done that are simpler, things such as picking up a piece of trash that you see on the floor on your way home. Helping out your little cousin, or neighbor with his/her homework. This acts as little as they may seem will make a difference in the end.

I think that the idea of having everyone participate in community service is great. Some kids might have difficulties with transportation but minor problems like that can be solved as simply as car pooling with a neighbor or friend, riding a bike which is even better because it helps out the environment, or even walking. And, all these small things that you might have to sacrifice for it, like watching a movie with your friends will be worth it in the end.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever thought about limiting the usage of your car ? If not you should start thinking of ways you can transport yourself without having to use your car each and everyday to do certain things and go certain places. limiting your car usages can be very helpful to not only you but the people thats around you. here's some reasons why ...

Sometimes limiting your car usage can be a great choice for you to make. without the usage of your car you can get wonderful excrise without even knowing. example, when your driving your car there's no energy running through your body. your body needs movement. A way you can transport and exricse is a bike. A bike can help you run energy through your body without you knowing unlike like a car. Not only your limiting your car usage but your getting fit and transportation as well.

Cars can be very harmful to your communitiy. The gas from your vehicle explores the air and that can cause a very filthy thing called polution in your communitiy. Some citizens don't think of it that way. people say that Cars are easier and faster  ways to get around but also hurtful during the process. this is one of the reasons people are getting sick. cars should be limited of their usage.

"The ""Face on Mars"" is really not a a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. There is no alien remains or anything like that. It sure does look like a face, but that was merely a coinsidence.

There are many ways to prove this statement. Today, I will only cover a few, though. They are very good points. By the end of this, I think you'll be agreeing with me also.

First of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body. If this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. Absolutely no body found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.

The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now. This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.

The third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest). ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" Garvin says.

In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Should the Facial Action Coding System be used in a classroom environment? Would being able to tell a students emotions help with giving them the lesson? I think it would for a few different reasons.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should be used inside and outside the classroom. It would help the teachers know what is going on inside the students heads. In which then they could give the lesson in a way that the students could feel better about their work. This also would help the teachers know what may be happening in he students lives. The Facial Action Coding System could also be used to look at pictures of people and see what their emotions were when that picture was taken. The Facial Action Coding System could and should also be used at everyday jobs. It would let the employees boss/bosses know what emotions they are feeling while working. Which would then let their boss/bosses know whether to fire them or change their work environment. Which in the long run would lead to happy, not as upset, or any other positive emotions the employees could have.

"If you was a student at Generic_School what would you say teacher or student designed ? There are those who argue that teachers should design the projects over the summer but this is not true. There is an ongoing debate about weather or not teachers should design summer projects during the break. Although some may disagree, I believe that students should design the projects over the summer. Because, we can make up are own projects, its a good way to keep us remembering things over the summer, and if we could make are own projects up the easier the better.

First, we can make are own projects up without someone telling us that we are doing something incorrect. Or they dont like the way that we are doing the project . An they want us to do it how they want it and they want it how they prefer it to look . Its better for me to think of something that wont give me a hard time to do. I wont be stressed out about it because my teacher didn't explain to me what to do specifically. These are some reason why students should design there own summer project.

secondly, If we make are own project up its easier and its better because its me making up my own project. Teachers might try to give us an project on a subject that i might be struggling in or having a hard time with. But its also, good practice for sols and other things like tests an it will also guide you through the summer. It wont be as challenging as it would have been if the teachers would have designed projects for the summer. An if we dont complete this over the summer it would reflect on us. Because we where told we could come up with are own type of project long it was a school related and a subject.

Although some may disagree, I believe that students should be allowed to design there own projects during the summer. An i have many reasons and examples to support why students should be allowed to design there own projects. I also have my reasons why teacher should not be allowed to design are projects for us in during the break. There are some that argue that students should be allowed to design there project this is true.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"There is a wide variety of reasons to why students take there classes at home; for example, medical issues, behavioral issues and environmental issues that are not safe for students; however, students that take there classes at there school districts have a higher chance of grasping information much more faster and in a timely efficient period, and the reason to that is because school students experience real time activities that help them understand what they are learning from their daily experiences at school.

However the students that take classes online do not have the hands on experience;such as, school projects, peer projects and educational field trips. Some people may say that home schooling is better due to the large cases of bullying, but that problem can always be solved, by reporting to your office or to your teacher.

To furthermore student that take their courses on the internet or by video conferencing do not benefit as much as how a real time student that go to school in there day to day basis; neither less, the students that take classes online tend to have problems in focusing, they can do whatever they want to do whenever they want, from my experience, on online classes, the only reason I took online classes is to experience it, and

I learned that most of the information that was provided to me was not live or even video provided, so i would always questions running in the back of my mind wondering when will it ever be answered.

I always had mental breakdowns due to the stress i was getting, and that is where the idea of online classes shinned in my thoughts; however, I tried taking online classes but in less a month I started experiencing depression because there was nobody to talk to, I was easily distracted by everything surrounding me, specially my phone. Some schools dont allow phones at school, for example in my freshmen I went to an international school, and the number rule was no gadgets on school grounds, at first

I thought it was funny but when i opened my phone at school they immediately confiscated my phone, and I had to call my parents so they can pick my phone up from the school principal, and i had to undergo a lesson to why phones are not allowed on school grounds?; such as; to what phone could cause to students at school?

I thought they made a big deal about it but actually they were right, it makes student lazy, self-centered, and mainly it stops you from doing your work most of the time if addicted. its the same thing when using online courses, for teen students specifically, statistics show that teenagers easily loose their patience and jump to using their cell-phones;however,all student should be supervised, so they could show better scores on there work and get help whenever they needed .

Schools provide the atmosphere for student to learn and understand topics that inflict our lives in different ways, ranging in hundred and maybe to thousands of specialties in learning new information everyday, schools provide materials that help student experience what there learning in their topics and make it more interesting. All children should always go to schools before requesting for homeschooling so they can experience hands on work, create new friendships that also can affect there choices on homeschooling and for counselors to understand why student want to be home schooled.                       ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I think that students should be allowed to use there cell phones during lunch. Because it is there free time and there not in class. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed on in the classrooms, but lunch time. So I would have to agree with policy 1. You should allow students to bring there cell phones to school as long as there off in the classrooms.

Just in case there is an emergency after school while walking home or waiting for your parents to get them. Students should also be allowed to have them on after school even though it still on school grounds. You the principal or vice principal should allow cell phones on during lunch time, because the students are not bothering anybody it is there free time. So why take them away while there out at lunch?

We just maybe want to listen to music, play games, text, or call people on our cell phones. I honestly believe that it is really not fair that the teachers take away our cell phones while there out during free time or some other activity. Even if your at volleyball tryout's they should be allowed because you're not inside the classrooms disturbing other students your enjoying your own time. Others just want time of there own as they can during school hours, just get a break from all the homework or class work they have to do.

Just for 40 minutes (lunch) of our day we want to use our cellular device. Everyone should have a chance at least every other Friday to have there cell phones on during lunch time. If you the principal or vice principal agreed on this also probably more students would get better grades in English, Math, History, or Science if you allowed this opportunity to have cell phones out during lunch periods.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"My name is John Doe and I am for the development these cars. I believe that the development of the cars will help out later in time. Wether that be saving peoples lives or saving gas money and helping out the economy in the long road developemnet of these cars is a neccessity. Also it will lower the amount of labor for using oil and help out with saving the worlds minerals.

Some of the reason why we should develop these cars in such way is to limit crashes in the united states and other countries and also it contributes to everyday people getting to work and home quicker and safer. Another reason we should develop cars are also to keep poeple safe and out of harms way even if they are a defensive driver, they still can't help if a drunk driver crashes into their car and kills them or someone else in the car with you. To add on the cars also make it to were every one is safe when in the future we will have so much technology humans will be safe from crashes. Even in todays world we cannot stop and say time out right before a crash is about to occur. WIth all the technology now it only helps prevent you the driver from stopping with warnings but what about the other driver or what if you ignore the warning and think it's something else.

There are a bunch of what if's in the technology field right now that only time will tell if some of these new car manufactures new equipment will work out in the cars. Such as vibrating seats used by GMC and aslo a vibrating wheel that is then nottifacted when a driver is falling asleep. Also other manufactures have been adding front and rear cameras for drivers to look at when backing out, also motion sensors that make sounds when an object is closing in on your car.

Too conclude my essay I would like to say that in the future I would like to see less oil used and futuristic cars made for safer transportation, and I would love to see fewer deaths than 100 in a year of car transportation deaths. That there would make news that the new future cars have really saved lives wether that be safer protection or transportation. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Although Venus has many dangers to it there are some parts of this planet that are very similar to Earth.

By having so many similarities to earth we could later bring life to Venus.

As well as Venus is right next to Earth so there wouldn't be many difficulties.

There are dangers to Venus but there are also some good qualities to it that could help us in the near future.

Venus is similar to Earth, only in some ways but there are many dangers of going there.

As said in paragraph 3 ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Looking back at this, it is telling us all about the dangerd of even going to Venus. NASA has had previous missions but have failed because the spacecraft couldn't last a few hours after landing.

Now obviously there has to be something on Venus or we wouldn't be going through all this trouble to get there. What is so good about Venus?

Yes, Venus does seem like a scary place if you read about it, but the only reason scientists want to look into it more is because of the similarities it has to our Earth.

As mentioned in paragraph 4 ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Scientists want to look more into Venus because of what we could do with it.

There are many ways that Venus can help our next generations.

All in all, NASA has been working on a new spacecraft that will go to Venus.

This way we can find out what Venus can truly do for us.

Although there are some threatning things among Venus, good comes from it too.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Operating a motor vehicle while on your cell phone

Being on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life. Many people around the world are injured by this situation every day. It could lead to accidents and altercations. In addition it would even cost you your licences. The most detrimental outcome is death. There are far more outcomes to operating a motor vehicle while being on a cell phone. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

One leading cause to motor vehicle accidents is being on your cell phone. It could lead to accidents and altercations. Yourself and the passengers are more at risk to bodily injuries and harm. These bodily injuries and harm can range anywhere from mild to critical condition. In an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved. There is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone. In an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such. An direct result of an event in place; a fee or very large payment would need to be made. Secondly another consequence could be having your license taken.

When you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence. Rather it being jail time, injuries, or more. Your license will be subjected to suspension. A suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated. The process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time. The average time for a suspended license is sixty days.

For some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good. Furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phone.

After all the consequences the most detrimental is death. Many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident. Not all people pass away at the crash site, some has a condition mild to critical that causes them to die. Around 1.6 million people a year die in motor vehicle accidents. Out of the 1.6 million, 1 out of 4 pass away because drivers are on their cell phone. That includes the driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car, around, or in another car. Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations, suspension of license, and even death. Prevention is simply not being able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle. Take a moment to focus on the road.

You are able to check your phone when you reach a red light or a complete stop. This is one step closer to its prevention. It will save many lives even your own.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"When the first photograph of the ""Face on Mars"" appeared in 1976, researchers and the general public lost their minds. The 'face' was a blurry and shadowy photo from the Viking 1 mission. The photo resembled a human face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Dispite all of the scientific and theorietical chaos it created, researchers at the National Areonautics and Space Administration (NASA) discovered that the 'face' was just a matian mesa.

Many people, even today, believe that this natural landform is actually an alien monument. This fallacy lead to many studies, researches, and experiments to find out what the face was. One explaination should cool the heated debated is that NASA is a professional institution built to study this very topic. It is also comprised of educated experts that work to learn and discover more for the rest of the population to learn correctly. However, this is not enough for many people to prove only the plausible.

In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the first portion of the article shows 3 compared photographs. These photographs are all of the 'face,' just in 3 different years. The first photo was taken in 1976, the next was in 1998, and the last one was taken in 2001. Each photo perfectly shows a new piece of the 'face' that was not well understood. The first photo shows what does clearly look like a face in the shadows, but as the photos become more recent, the face receads and becomes what looks like a river, or lava system flowig down the sides. These photographs were taken by separate space missions by none other than NASA. These photos are what fueled the conspiracy theorists theories but only because of the lack of information that they had at the time.

In the article, in paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had taken the sharpest photo of the time. This photo stood to prove what the NASA researchers were trying to say. The photograph itself proved that there were not alien markings on the 'face' and that it was only a natural landmark. This photo showed that the elements that made up the 'face,' were just ""the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mesa."" (12) It showed small elevated spots on the surface that, from afar and in the shadows, a human-like face appeared around all of it.

However, for some headstrong citizens, this still was not enough to prove what the photo really showed. This lead to the 2001 MGS mission to capture yet another, improved photo of the surface of Mars. The team that which took the photo prided themselves on taking the ""extraordinary photo with the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" (10) In paragraph 10 of the article, it explains that in 2001, the resolution of the photo (1.56 meters per pixel) was beyond fantastic compared to the resolution of the 1976 photo (43 meters per pixel). This comparison is enough to show that in 2001, the landmark could be seen very clearly with the human eye and could be clearly made out as just a landform. The photo was clearly just a bit o' rock jutting out of the surface of Mars.

The 1976 controversy over the ""Face on Mars"" was truely a very heated debate. Starting in 1976 when a blurry image of a face on Mars made it's way through the minds of the Americans, the ""Face on Mars"" was concieved to be an alien relic of some sort. Years later, a new photograph produced by NASA in 1998 began to settle long held debates over the face. It proved to many researchers that this startling human like face was only a natural landmark with a coincedental shape and shadow. This did not, however, settle all of the disputes amongst the ammeture conspiracy theorists. To further prove the point, NASA pushed it's limits in 2001 and took an amazingly sharp photo of the land mark. The photo was pure proof to the nation that the fantisized face was only a small mesa on the surface of Mars. Even today some theorists still try to hold their ground in their thoughts, but it will always be known to science as just a martian mesa that caused some commotion.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Phones and Driving

Over time we've seen the consequences of phones and driving manifest itself in the form of negative impacts upon the world. Phones have negatively affected our people in ways that we have experienced so much pain through the increase in casualty rate. Although phones have had its positive advantages, phone have also had it's disadvantage. Over time the increase in technological devices has caused many distraction in more ways than science can explain. Moreso we see this change and distraction throughout out cars and times of travel. Because of the way we are so emotionally attached to our phones, we forget the importance of many different situations at hand. However, drivers should not be able to operate their technological devices while in a vehicle.

When the discussion is brought upon among the awareness of phones and driving, people get mad. They get frustrated in a manner that they feel the authority, police, and the people are in fact "" doing too much"". The vision that the people don't see is the value of their lives and the correlation between that idea and cellphones in use while operating a vehicle. Studies and different statistics have shown the causes of death from the use of cell phones while driving. Within this modern society, different policies and ordinances have been put into place to show the importance of abstaining from the use of cellphones in the vehicles. Not only does using your cellphones in the car out your life in danger, but also the people surrounding you.

The authority and the government needs to make this social issue more aware to the public. The use of cellphones in our vehicles should be prohibited. Too much death and pain has been caused by devices like our cell phones. It is imperative that we make the people more aware on this issue. If we don't take this matter seriously, we will continue to see the negative impact confide within our communitie, nation, and world as a whole. There should be no more talking about the issue and whether or not it should be prohibited. The answer is at hand. Drivers should not be on their devices while operating a vehicle.

"Did you know that having an extracurricular activity can help you with high school and college? Have you ever had a passion for some kind of activity or sport, but couldn't do it because you never had the time? Well, now is your chance to achieve your goal of getting on varsity football, or working in student council. I agree with the principal that every student should have at least one extracurricular activity because it can help build new friends, build your self-esteem and confidence , and lastly it might just help you get a scholarship in college if you do a sport.

You know it's a struggle to make friends these days. People working together and helping each other out could possibly help them become friends. That is just one of the many perks of being on a team or group that supports you. The feeling of love, support, and praise can boost our confidence. This is one of the reasons why everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity.

Building your self esteem and confidence is one of the many things that we can achieve on our own. All you have to do is believe in your self and trust your friends. Supporting your friends and yourself can help everyone on a team come together as one. That is just one way of boosting yourself and your friends/teammates. Although, it is very important to encourage each other you must remember that doing it in a negative way could only effect your relationship with that person. That was my second reason for why I agree with the principal.

We all know that many people don't go to college due to the fact that they can't afford it. Well, maybe if you take a sport as your, extracurricular activity and you're good at it, they might consider giving you a full scholarship. Just keep in mind that you have to go to the same college and you can't quit the sport. As long as you enjoy it you will be fine. That is my last reason for supporting the principals decision.

Now knowing that picking an extracurricular activity can help you throughout your life. Consider that it can boost our confidence, help you gain friends, and many more. Hoping that you read this and agree with the principals decision. I also hope that you apply it to your life and become as successful as you can.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal,

Dear principal I believe that students should bring cell phones to school. Why? simply because they are a important part to our daily life. Cell phones do not hurt anyone's education as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. If cell phones are turned off then students wont be focusing on their cell phones. It would be nice to let students use their cell phones during lunch or during their free time. If students use their cell phones during their lunch then the students wont want to use them during class time because they already used their cell phones during lunch.

Students bring cell phones too school all the time! Telling students not to bring cell phones isn't going to stop them. So why not just let them bring their cell phones to school with the condition making them turn their cell phones off during class time but letting students use their cell phones during lunch periods or even their free time. If the principal lets students use their cell phones during their free time maybe students will get rid of the egger to use their cell phones during class.

If cell phones are off during class then students wont have the erg to use their cell phones. This simply means that studets wont focuse on there cell phone but their educational time. Students should also follow the rules of having their cell phones turned of",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Well i think that we should use phones but if anyone sees tell people to put there phone away.

They can use them when need to or on break to get a drink . They should not be able to have phones with them because they might use it in class or might take it out at class.

If i were to see the phones i would say put it back in your book bag and do not take it out. If i saw someone with a phone out i would get mad and might give the people a talking to also i might even say i need your phone fro the rest of the day. Tell them i will not give your phone back the next time and i will call home if i have to. Now i would make it a law not to have phones with students and also band the phones. One thing i do not get is why high school has to have boo bags with them .They should have the phones in the book bags . They should just leave the phones in there locker or book bag .I am going to high school next year so maybe they school make a new rule about phones. Now if it was something really bad then i can see having your phones with us and or next to us .My friend gets to have her phone with her at all times because she is able to have her phone with her but she goes to a different school and it is far away . when i get older i might want to help people with the same problem so i might protest and see what every school will say. I thin k they will think it is all right to have a phone in book bags just not with you at all times. I might tell people people that it is all right to be different and to not worry if you have to have a phone with you at all time and if not to aversive that we do not all need phones and to just be ok without phones.

"Summer assignments are important to help students continue learning over the summer. This is why these assignments should be designed by teachers, rather than students. This is due to the fact that teachers are going to assign challenging projects, which most students would not; additionally, teachers may use this assignment as a way to prepare the students for the following year.

Everyone wants to enjoy their summer break, go on vacations, and chill at the beach. Summer assignments are a great way to put a pause on the fun. Knowing this, students are not going to purposefully give themselves a challenging project that could benefit them in the long run. They would create assignments requiring the least amount of effort and time in order to get back to playing videogames or tanning on the beach. This defeats the purpose of the summer assignment because an easy project that does not challenge you will not continue your learning throughout the summer.

Additionally, this may be a great opportunity for teachers to help prepare students for the type of assignments they will be recieving the following school year. Students are unaware of what to expect, so they cannot prepare themselves adequately. Teachers have also been with these same students all year and know what they are good at, and what they need to work on. Assigning them a summer project may help these students work on their weak points, and gives them plenty of time to improve before the next school year.

Some may argue that if students are not actively trying to challenge themselves, then they are only hurting themselves. However, many students likely are not sure what type of project would benefit them best, or are unaware of what they need to work on to improve. They also likely assume that they do not need to be challenged or believe that they are already prepared for the next school year.

Overall, students would benefit more from teacher-designed summer assignments. Teachers know what students need to be prepared for and where their weak spots are. Often times students are unaware of how to help themselves improve. This last assignment can lead students in the right direction and assure that they are fully prepared for the following school year.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"This artical is telling us how Venus get called "" Evening Star."" Venus is a planet in our solar system not everyone knows that because some people don't care.

But what people didn't know about Venus is that humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to Venus. The thing about Venus is that everytime we send a spacecraft is only lasts for a few hours. They're going to try sending more spacecrafts because ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limitdating endeavors""

When they called Venus ""Evening Star"" beacause during the evening you could see Venus so clear. The reason why you could seen Venus not just because how bright Venus was but also because Venus is closer to us then you think. BUt the point of the nickname is because Venus is a misleading panet in our solar system.

We say that Earth and Venus are twins because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. People might think that when we say twins they might think that everything is the say on Venus but nobody know how Venus looks like because everytime we send the spacecraft in only last for a few hours. Never enough hours or days to see everything we want to see and view. The speed of Venus ""means orbit the sun at different speeds."" This probably mean why not spaceship don't last for very long in Venus.

""The atmosphere on Earth 97 percent dioxide blankets Venus."" Which makes that it's going to be more hard than we thought. Even though it might be more complicated we're still going to find a way. We want to know everything on Venus

In this parts of the article the author has the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers and he explains his reasoning with the context that is left behind this article. The passage tells us about why its worthy to pursuit it, in passage 8 it says, ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The meaning of this part of the passage is telling us how people just think about how or what it is like to explore Venus. NASA has been trying to make inventions to help them go to Venus an have a closer look."" NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.""

Althouth people want to go and explore Venus, there are some challenges that Venus provides for people. The dangers in this article tells us in passage 1 "" While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" its hard for us to explore something from far away but during the attemptes we still can get close to Venus. In the passage it says, ""A lot of spacecraft haven't survived the landing in a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" These are some reason why we can not reach Venus as worthly it is, it is challenging to explore.

NASA has been also trying to help make machines and new inventions that are safe for people to go up and for themselves.

"Cell phones were first presented in the US in the time of 1980 and their utilization right away developed during the following two decades. One of the essential explanations behind the enormous development of phones is that they encourage correspondence offering an increasing amount of adaptability contacting wanted individuals inside seconds. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. Different drivers out and about consider drivers on their mobile phones whether they need to or not in light of the dangers they make. Mobile phones allow users to reach others during crisis notwithstanding during driving, in spite of a viable method for correspondence, utilizing cell phones during driving outcomes in diverting consideration of driver increasing road safety concerns.

To begin with, we have turned out to be so centered around the amount we can do at one time that we are eager to chance our own security just as the wellbeing of others since we can't put down our cell phones. Studies found that a cell phone put drivers at a four times more serious danger of an accident. When driving, once in a while it is hard to concentrate out and about which makes it simple to overlook that the streets are shared by everybody and not for your use. A young lady slaughtered a walker on a bike while she was messaging on her telephone. She might not have proposed to take such an individual's life, however she settled on the poor choice to drive and text which she needs to live with for the rest of her life. Any of us could have been that poor individual on that portentous day. Regardless of the dangers, individuals still use cell phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says ""He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of "" ... the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians.

On the other hand, those whose work relies upon a mobile phone like legal advisors or agents state that they generally must be accessible to pick up the telephone to keep their business running. Be that as it may, due to their propensities, they can make risky and unsafe circumstances like an impact or a mishap. Business issues can be upsetting and perilous while driving since it can cause enthusiastic responses that can prompt disaster. As a result of the discussion they may get furious and this can bring down their driving capacity that can prompt lose power over the vehicle. If Individuals don't settle on a choice to secure their mobile phones their routine can hurt honest individuals. Rivals state that without hands set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. Nonetheless, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing a mishap and even may it intensify by recommending that the conduct is sheltered. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing headset can be as risky as holding a telephone on the grounds that the discussions diverts drivers from concentrating out and about. Researchers had demonstrated that individuals talking via telephone picture individual who they conversing with and that doesn't meddle with driving. The issue is the point at which a vehicle swerves startlingly or person on foot venture into traffic, and the mind comes up short on the handling capacity to respond in time. So the issue isn't in holding the haggle telephone in the meantime what may cause a mishap in view of need man oeuvre, it is a result of discussion and absence of response at the especially time.

In conclusion , if individuals don't surrender their cell phones, the quantity of fatalities on the streets will even now increment. It is individuals duty to not bring about their very own and others individuals lives. these days mobile phones are pointless gadgets since they are untrustworthy in crisis circumstances while On Star is dependably plan to help you in a mishap. Reckless driving is something that we as a whole get very worked up about, particularly on the off chance that it makes us late or is generally an immediate burden to us.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Schools should offer online classes or video conferences because students could do their work when they're not at school, and it would save the school money; however, there would be a higher chance of them cheating.

First, if the student is not able to get to school, they could do there work at home. Sometimes, students also have family vacations during school; therefore, the students could work on vacation. My friend Generic_Name misses school all the time because of family events. Generic_Name's school offers online classes, which means Generic_Name can turn in his work even though he is not at school. Students would have more time to complete their work since they can do it after school. Students would be more likely to turn in their work with the extra time they have to finish it; the students would then have better grades and actually be able to keep their grades high.

Secondly, online classes would save the school money. Schools that have some classes that only online could save money because they would not need to hire more teacher. That means the school would have ore money to improve the school itself and make the online classes more effective. Schools could even charge a small fee for online classes, so that way the school would be making a small profit. Generic_Name's school has managed to buy all kinds of new equipment for charging for online classes, for example: laptops, desk, gym equipment, snack vending machines, desk, and chairs. Generic_Name's school still has extra money to spend on the classes.

However, it would be easier for students to cheat on assignments. Students have access to more website at home than when they are at school. They could also get someone else to do their work for them. Most of the time schools probably won't realize the student has cheated. If the schools buy the students laptops; they could block access to some websites, therefore, making it harder to cheat and easier to see what websites the students are viewing.

In conclusion, schools should have online classes because students could do their work at home, and it would save the school money; however it's easier for students to cheat. Having online classes would be very helpful to school. It would bring in a small income and allow more kids to learn. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think policy one is the best policy because kids are allowed to bring other stuff to school. kids walk home and parents usually want kids to have there cell phones just in case of an emergency. I think if you chooses the second policy there would be a big problem with parents and kids. If a teacher see' s or hear' s a cell phone during class then take it away and give it to the office just like normal.

I think most people would choose policy one because it seems like a better policy to have. If you choose policy two there would be a problem with kids bringing phones to school anyway. I don't think anybody would pay attention to your rules and policy's, kids would still bring cell phones to school. I don't think very many kids text in class, and if they do i still think they are getting their work done. To me cell phones aren't a big deal in schools. so i think we should just keep it how it is, and not have to worry about it anymore. Policy number one is a better policy then policy two.

Policy number one is a better policy because a lot of kids walk home after school and if something bad happens and they don't have their cell phone it would not be good so its better if we don't take that chance. Some kids go home with another friend after school, the parents usually want the kid to have there cell phone with them just in case there's a change in plan, or kid needs picked up. Its a good thing to keep your phone with you. Another reason why policy 1 is the better policy is because most kids have sports after school. After a sport they might need to call someone to come pick them up or call someone for any other reason. Its a dumb idea to have to keeps phones at home, when we need them with us. thank you.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME

Having cell phones at school would be a good idea.

They would be a good idea because if you don't allow to have phones at school then they might get hurt by someone.

If she or he was too be walking home or riding a bike home then how would they be able too call for help if they were attacked.

Plus it would make students happier.

If the students are happier then they would want to do there work more and more.

Then it would just be a cycle of events accruing in our school.

If you gave them the opportunity to have phones then they would respect you more as a person.

There wouldn't be any issues with phones being out at the wrong time if you just have an assembly and set the ground rules so they.

Next if you need your home work that you left at home then you can just text your mom in the morning.

This would prevent you from getting a bad grade.

Also if you forget your lunch then you don't have stave.

You can just call your dad or mom to come bring it to you.

And if you are hungry then your not going to be focused on what your doing in class.

Then the teacher will be mad at the student and then you would have to deal with them.

Over all that would just make your job harder.

Then if your job is harder you will start aging faster and faster until you just lose your mind.

Then you'll start to get a divorce and your life will start spiraling down and down until you hit rock bottom.

As i was saying i think having students to be able to have phones at school would be great and benefit all of us.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe requiring students to perform community service is a spectacular idea.

Helping out the community around us is so generous and all 600 students here at SCHOOL_NAME

could really make a huge impact.

It will teach many of us lessons that we will carry throughout life.

To begin with, generosity and benevolence are both great traits to possess.

Having the opportunity to help out the less fortunate around us will help us learn how to have these characteristics.

There are many families and people in our community that don't have heat in this cold winter, can't afford groceries and food to feed their family, have lost their jobs, or don't even have a home to live in.

I believe we often take for granted what all of our privileges.

For instance, many kids are upset or get annoyed with all of the work at school.

However, we should be grateful for being able to get an education and learn so much.

Overall, I believe doing hours of community service and helping people is priceless.

Next, participating in this experience is bound to teach every single student a lesson that they will be able to apply to many circumstances in their future.

For example, one child could learn that giving is better than receiving.

This lesson could be taught by going to soup kitchens and donating goods, or even serving food at a homeless shelter.

Last year, a friend and I decided to give back to the community around us.

We volunteered at a local homeless shelter and served dinner to all of the people there.

Every time one of them would say, ""Thank you"" I would feel so excited.

To know that they appreciate simple act, meant the world to me.

Another lesson they could learn would be that everyone could make a difference.

If all 600 students at this school contributed in community service, a huge result would be seen.

Furthermore, students contributing time to help the struggling people in their community is such a great idea.

I believe that if students think that it is getting in the way of activities that they would rather do, they will learn after the first few times how much more other people and families need it.

All in all, students contributing time to do community service is a marvelous idea.

"Just as crisp Autumn air rolling just around the corner and summer is coming to a bitter sweet ending. Then OH NO!

You completely forgot about that pesky summer assignment your teacher gave you. You were supposed to read one book every week and write an analysis. This is what its like for every student young or old when given a summer assignment. That is why summer projects and assignments should be student designed as it gives students the opportunity to create something they will enjoy and held accountable for as well as giving teachers a break.

The projects given to students over the summer are nine times out of ten busy work. A very large assignment most of the time having to do with reading and then writing about how you feel about that particular topic assigned. When a student is given busy work there is no real learning happening. If students create their own projects this very issue can be avoided as they can change and adapt their project so they are genuinely learning. Another reason student should be allowed to design their own summer assignments is because it will give them the opportunity to create something fun, quick and easy and that still assures students are learning during their break. Students don't regularly get a lot of liberties when it comes to their projects. Letting students creating their own assignments will help students feel in charge and create something they will enjoy doing. Furthermore It will also help students learn in their own way as not everyone is the same. Student designed summer projects will make students feel in control of their learning and create a project fit for them and their learning style whatever that may be.

When students are given the option to create their own summer project it makes it much easier for the student to be held accountable. Students know how much work they are able to do as well as the skill level required for their project. When students create their own projects its always going to be able something they enjoy, making it easier for them to do the project and be held accountable for it. Students are also able to create their own project knowing they are being graded not on the standard for everyone else but the standard for themselves. This takes a lot of pressure off of students as they feel like they will be graded fairly as long as long as they do as much as they are capable of doing and do it well. If the student does not complete the project for whatever reason it is much easier for them to be held accountable for it, as excuses like ""I didnt understand"" or ""It was to hard for me"" will become invalid because they are the ones who create the project. Thus making it clear that student designed projects will benefit everyone and insure work is being down.

Some people who believe that teachers should design summer project may argue that because they are the ones that create student assignments and projects for students on a day to day basis they would be able to create a project more efficiently in comparison to a student.

Although what people with these beliefs fail to realize is that teachers are humans too and they get tired. Teachers wait for the summer to come just as much as students and to have them create an entirely new project towards the end of the year can be very tiring after having a year full of creating assignments. When the students create their own summer project it allows for teachers to be able to relax and take some weight off their shoulders as the day until summer slowing come. Another argument that could be made as to why teachers should make summer projects is that teachers will create projects tailored for the student as they work with them the whole year but this is in fact wrong. Teachers are one person and are not able to create strong bonds with every students they come across. Typically the project given is one standard made to fit everyone but thats not possible as everyone is not the same. This is why students should be allowed to create their own summer projects.

All in all student should be given the opportunity to create their own summer projects. This because students will create something they enjoy and will do. It will also give teachers with one less project to make. After all why take the hard way when allowing the students to design the project themselves can be just efficient with less work for both students and teachers. That is exactly why students should be allowed to create their own summer projects. At the end of the day everyone just wants to enjoy their summer the best way possible. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In that work we gonna explain, give ideas and talk a little bit about the problems at the study of Venus because that planet is very dangers to survival

Though Venus is a ""sister"" of the Earth Planet is not the same, Venus is not safetly to people live in their because doesn't have the sufficient oxygen to survival. Thoughthe austronomers are fascined with Venus because is the most similar planet to the Earth. But this planet obviusly have a differents to Earth like, the surface on Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees that is crazy and impossible to survival and in venus are present Volcanos eruptions.

A idea for the NASA from me to send people to study the planet, is implement a new jetplane more security for thr austronomers for they can survival and can study the planet. And a new uniform most special for the can have the capacity to survival that dangers problems at Venus.

"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is an article written to try and pursuade people on why Earth needs to visit Venus. The author talks about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it presents many dangers to human life and machines. The author supports their idea of pursuing Venus despite the dange very well because he talks about human curiosity, the machines that have been and could be used to get to Venus, and why Venus has been considered to be explored.

First, the author talks about human curiosity about the planet Venus. The author finishes the article off by talking about human curiosity and how this helps shape the world today (paragraph 8). This shows that human curiosity is important in peoples lives because it has allowed mankind to create many different things to help people explore the unknown, like the moon, and can be used to explore many different planets humans have looked at for centuries. The article also talks about how researches want to talk ""samples of rock, gas, or anything else...""(paragraph 6). This demonstrates human curiosity because mankind wants to discover unknown secretes about plantets and wants to enrich our knowledge on the known universe and taking samples will help unlock these secretes.

Secondly, the article talks about what machine have been used and what machines could be used to help explore Venus. The article starts off by saying ""No space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours...[because] the plantets surface is 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" (paragraph 2-3). This gives an insite on how the planets surface is because it is so hot that all the space craft humans have sent to Venus have been destroyed because of the extreamly hot temperatures. However, later in the article the author talks about how NASA has thought about creating a blimp that could float over storms and ground of Venus (paragraph 5). This shows that a blimp could be used to find secretes and help humans discover the planet that people have been gazing up to for centuries.

Finally, the author discusses why Venus want to be explored. The author talks about how Venus resembles Earth very closely and refers to it as ""Earth's Twin""(paragraph 2). Venus has been called ""Earth's Twin"" which means it has some qualities similar to Earth. People now want to discover if other planets were ever like earth or if they could sustain human life. People want to explore Venus because they want to see if it could sustain life like Earth. Also the article talks about how Venus has ""familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"" (paragraph 4). Since Venus has familiar features it is a prime area to explore because human's maybe able to find a new planet that is habitial and create colonies.

In conclusion the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because he talks about human curiosity, the machines that could be used, and why people want to explore Venus. Human curiosity supports this because humans have wanted to unlock the secretes of the universe for generations and exploring Venus may help in this quest. The machines that could and have been used is a way human's could find these secretes. Why people want to explore Venus is not just for the secretes it could possess but also because it is similar to Earth in many ways and is even called its twin. Venus could help mankind find out what they have wanted to know since the beginnig of time and Venus should be explored despite the dangers to help solve these secretes.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Which shouldn't be allowed while driving because you could cause serious matters for you and everyone surrounding you. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. The feeling is that young drivers find it enough of a challenge to operate a car, and that any distractions are dangerous. The punishment you get for using a hand-held phone while driving is commensurate with how dangerous that behaviour. A part of the problem is people may answer an email or text they consider to be urgent while driving and because they don't have an accident, they think it's safe to do again. Ways to prevent this from happening; Put your phone away while driving. Putting your phone on mute or turning your phone off entirely is a sure-fire way you to avoid being distracted by it while you're driving. Have a conversation with people in your car or on the phone (even hands-free).To break these habits, people can either turn off their phone or put it on silent before driving. This will force them to concentrate on the road only. But if this method doesn't work on some people, you can use Siri to command your phone to read your messages or to reply back. Texting is a major factor when it comes to crashes and creating a hazardous situation, so preventing the usage of cell phones while driving would be a large step in limiting the number of crashes that happen in the United States. There are multiple associations that are already trying to prevent cell phone usage.      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear State Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME and I am in favor of changing to election by a popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that the people should have more of a say in who runs our nation and I also believe that we might be a better nation if we were the ones who decided who ran it.

The Electoral College does not let the people of the nation speak, 538 electors speak for the billions in the United States of America. Also, if the electors vote and the results come out to be a tie, the election now has to be put into the hands of the House of Representatives. Being as there is only one vote from each state allowed the results will probably not reflect the choices and wishes of the people.

The Electoral College is an old compromise the was made by the founding fathers, but some changes have to be made to fit the modern times and ways. With the way society is built now changes to some of the political aspects of the country have to be made.

Although the Electoral College has its pros, such as its setup for if a tie is made, there are more cons in the situation. So with that I am asking that you think about the people and try to change some of the ways of the United States political system.

"Dear Principle,

I think Policy 1 is the better choice because this allows the students to have their phones at school. Even if you went with Policy 2, the students would still bring their phones to school. They would ignore the ""No Phones At School"" rule.

So I think you should go with Policy 1 because it will allow the students some time to be on their phone. I think that if you went with Policy 1 you would have less problems with the students sneaking in their phones to school and into class.

If you went with Policy 1 the students would be able to make arrangements with friends and parents on their lunch break or free time.

If you went with Policy 2 and banned all cell phones from school, you would have to deal with students texting in class and bringing their phones to school anyway. I think you should go with Policy 1 instead of Policy 2 because at least Policy 1 allows the students to have some cell phone time, but if a students grades were dropping because of the cell phone rule than I think you should talk to the student and the students parents and discipline that student and not the whole school.

You also have to think about the students and their grades, for instance if a student has anything below a C(which is average) than I feel that they should not be able to go on their phones. If a student is passing all classes with at least a C, or if they have all A' s or B' s than they should be able to use their phones during their free time.

"Most students after coming from a stressful day in school often choose to lay in the couch, watch TV or play video games and stay up really late, they can even sometimes forget to eat or eat a bunch of snacks.

Having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity allows them to socialize with students, participate in activities they enjoy or even find something new to try. For some students it can be hard to manage their time at home or might not be able to fit a few hours to complete these activities in their schedule. If your having difficulties with time, its important to communicate with your parents, I am sure they can figure something out.

When students do outdoor activities or school activities it can help them keep things off their minds like, problems at home,in school or in certain places outside. Its important to try keeping stress and anxiety the farthest away from students to help them stay focused in school and become successful.

Your friends call you and ask you what happened. Did something go wrong? Did we miss any extra votes last night?  You go look at the votes, they are still the same.  Then you relize that the Electoral College did not care what the people of this country said.

It also states that the presidental candidates can also vote for the electors not just the people and the state.  But what is not fair, is that the voters can not always control who the electors vote for.  The citizens should be able to vote for the president they want.  The man or woman they want to run their country. The people of the United States vote to make this country a better place for everyone.  Because they believe their candidate that they vote for will make this country a better place.

Furthermore the Electoral College is the stupides thing I ever heard of and i think we should get rid of it.  I agree with the aritcal ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" because it says, ""that the electoral college says is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

"In my opinion and support from the passages reducing car use or stopping car usage all together is a great thing. It's safer, helps the environment, and saves money.

Reducing car usage to almost none makes it a lot safer for kids to run around the streets and play and for parents to not stress about their kids getting hit by a car. There's also a lot less accidents without cars on the road. Think about it, 2 cars hitting into each other both people could possibly die, but if 2 bikers hit eachother both are more than likely able to walk away from it with maybe a couple bruises and a broken bone.

What if you never had to pay for gas ever again? That'd be awesome right? All you have to do is not use your car anymore and just ride a bike, walk, skate or find other means of transportation. You'd save lots of money. In Vauban once car use was out of the picture everything was placed in walking distance and there wasn't even a need for cars any more unless you were traveling out of the country somewhere.

Also, reduciong car usage helps keep the Earth a lot cleaner and the air would have a lot less pollution in it which would also make it safer for us to breathe and healthier for us to breathe in.

"" ' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ' Dr. Huang predicts.' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor' ""

( paragraph 6, D'Alto). This states that if the student is getting confused or bored the computer can modify's the lesson and the lesson will be better.

Second, the computer will detect if you like or not like what you're watching. For example, if the video you're given isn't a good one and you really don't like it then the computer can change it and give you a better suggestion. Also, the computer will understand how some people only express with emotions. "" ' The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive - for video games or surgery. ' Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, ' notes Dr. Huang. ' So computers need to understand that, too "" (paragraph 6, D'Alto ). This explains how computer can undertand when you like something and also how they need to understand that most communication is used my emotios or expressions.

Third, it detects if you're happy or sad. If you're happy it will make sure to keep you like that but if you're sad it might play you something so you can cheer up and do your work. Its difficult to do your work when you're sad , when you're sad you don't even want to work. ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar add will follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different""(paragraph 6, D'Alto ). This supports my reason because it talks about how the computer knows when you're sad or happy.

In conlcusion, having a computer that can read your emotions wouldn't be bad to have in a classroom. I think they will make the classrooms a litltle bit better. First, because if the student is getting bored the computer can modify the lesson. Second, because it can detect what you do and don't like. Last, because it will detect when you're happy or sad.

"In the past, owning a car has been very beneficial and very efficient in order to go about our daily lives. In the past few years, however, people are buying less and less cars and taking the train or bike to get around. All this has been brought up by environmental conditions some countries have had to deal with recently. There are advantages to having a car, but there are more advantages without one.

Driving cars allow people to get from point A to point B in a matter of minutes, but this harms the environment drastically. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intesive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 5, Source 1). These emissions can cause major damage not just to one location but the whole planet overall.""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"" (Duffer, Paragraph 17, Source 2). Smog has caused a problem in Paris recently, having more smog than other major Western European cities. ""Diesels make up 67 percentof vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Europe, according to Reuters"" (Duffer, paragraph 16, Source 2). Paris and other cities like it are faced with a huge environmental problem. Later on , however, Paris put a plan in to stop all of these emissions. On one day, motorists with even-numbered license plates had to leave their car at home or face a 31$ fine. The next day would be the odd-numbered plates. Congestion went down 60 percent, allowing the French ruling party to cancel the ban of odd-numbered plates on the next day.

With this decreased use of cars, many cities are reforming the suburbs, such as Vauban, Germany. ""Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free'..."" (Rosenthal, paragraph 2, Source 1). In result to this change, less carbon is being emitted while providing a safe and secure environment for the families that live there. Another city who has made a similar change like Vauban is the city of Bogota in Colombia. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million"" (Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 21, Source 3). The goal of this event is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Here in the United States, car sales and the amount of people getting a driver's license has diminished. ""...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends... Likewise, the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including shared van services for getting to work"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 35, Source 4). So even though we may not realize it, technology has allowed us to stay connected without having to burn gas and harm the environment while trying to go to your friend's house. These efforts to decrease the use of cars have been a success in the amount of people participating and the beneficial effects to the environment, like Paris and the decreasing amount of smog.

As countries start to realize the amount of cars and emissions they produce, projects have gone in to make city streets more accessible for alternative vehicles. ""...stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6, source 1). This approach forces people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving a car into the city center. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks...rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" (Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 28, Source 3). In conclusion, there have been many efforts in order to promote alternative ways of transportation into cities .

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage include the decreased emissions of carbon into the atmosphere, the use of alternative transportation through exercise, and the reformation of cities to become safer with easier access to certain shops and venues. As time goes on, awareness of greenhouse gases and carbon emissions increases, and more and more things are done in order to stop the diminishing of our environment.            ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Students should not have to have a b average to play sports, because it is already c average which is c' s and b' s. What is that not good enough for you. We are already try our hardest to get good grades and play sports. All I'm trying to say is that students love sports and love to play it and watch it. and if we have to have a b average or higher to play sports than that team is not going to be good.

That team is not going to be good because there will be less practices, the team will be busy studying. They will be focusing a whole lot more on what was for homework and do we have a test tomorrow. Then your guys high school team will be at the bottom and i don't think we want that.

"Dear senator

I would like to ask you to please change voting regulations from the Electoral College to popular vote. The Popular vote would work much better because voters are not really voting for a presedent we are voing for a slate of electors.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. An example of this is in 2000, Gore and Bush were canidates, and when the votes were counted Gore have more popular votes but less electoral votes then Bush, this was the forst time that happend sence the election of 1888. Another example of the electoral college regulations being unfair is in 2012 when Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral vote as opose to only 51.3 percent cast for him and Romney. And a nationwide tie with electoral votes is possable because of the number of votes is 538, its an even number although it is highly unlikely.

The winner-take-all method of awarding all electoral votes to 1 specific canadate is unfair aswell because as we have seen in 2012 the canadates focus mainly on serton states because all states are worth a diffrent amount of electoral votes. Such as California being worth 55 votes and Washinton state being priced at 12 votes or New Mexico being at a total cost of 5 votes.

In the end the electoral vote is unfair. I just wish that you would change the voiting regulations from bring and electoral vote to being a popular vote.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"When Luke first started the program he thought it was a opportunity of a lifetime. He knew it would be a good thing for a small-town boy like him. He wanted to be able to help out others and that program was an awesome way to do so.

He got to spend time with animals, got to play games occasionally, got to be helpful, got to see amazing sights, and got to see his friends. The program was an awesome way to do a lot of things. One example is how Luke got to tour an excavated castle in Crete. He also got to see Europe and China. That is unbelievable opportunity for a boy like him. Luke got to have fun by playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be an awesome adventure. A quote straight from Luke was,""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Another quote from Luke was,""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" That proves that even if you had to work you were still having the best time ever. The job as a Seagoing Cowboy is more than just hard work, and being miserable. You actually get to enjoy your time.

If you want to have a great job I'm sure all the Seagoing Cowboys will agree that you should be one of them. Yes, you do have to work hard, but that isn't a reason you shouldn't join. How many other jobs do you get to see amazing sights, or play volleyball and other games. As a Seagoing Cowboy you even get to help people out with their country and their needs. This is why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy, and I'm sure Luke agrees ,too.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

Many students do not have a B average, instead many have a C average. They are trying very hard to reach that B, but sometimes it just doesn't work. Today I ask of you to at least let those with a high C average, 75+, allow to do these sports or other activities. If you do this, the liability that the students will try harder to at least reach that 75 will be higher.

They will try their best in every way, and you will have less people failing classes, maybe. Plus, there are classes that are difficult to do. Everyone has a strong point in a subject, and their weak point. For example, some one can be really good at math, but in science they are struggling, and already having a tutor trying to help them, but sometimes a tutor just can't help them. We try hard, we some times fail, but were at least trying.

You know how their is always that one child in every class that will always be the bad one. When I say bad, I mean the one kid that always goofing off, making funny jokes, and disturbing everyone. Wells their are several reasons for why that person does that. One reason, their just not good at that subject, and so they don't care what they get, and start to goof around.

Grades are the scariest thing to get. Especially when you have a specific grade to reach. Some parents will get mad, if their child has a C, and they would just push that child, telling him or her all these great things that could happen if they have an A or B, or they will tell their kid about how they were in the past. Then when a child gets an F, the parents become more pushy, they don't meant it, but they just want their kid to have a better future. Since this is happening children have only been struggling, because their constantly being pushed to do something better when they really don't want to. They are not relaxing enough. They are not having time to themselves to enjoy their own life, instead they are cramming their nose in a schools book reading. I'm not saying that shouldn't read, but it should really be just for a short time, like 10 minutes.

I ask of you to at least let those with a high C or above be able to participate in sports or other activities. Well at least try to do it this way, and if it doesn't help at the end of the year then you can go back to doing the B average. Just remember to consider how other students are. Watch them through the hall, listen to them, and see what they are doing. Adults can learn a lot from a kid if they actually payed attention and viewed everything the way the child is does.

Sincerely,

A fellow student",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. After personally reading this article, I believe a driverless car would be a positive impact on the road today. The article mentions many positive things including fuel efficency, crash proof, advanced safety sensors, and an understanding computer that knows when driving is too difficult for its self. I believe that driverless cars will become a positive impact due to extreme environmental safety, driver safety, and intelligent computer understanding.

In the first paragraph, the author states that, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."". In our environment, we have had many mishaps dealing with cars and the pollution they cause to our environment from the day they were made. When the author states that the driverless cars would use half the fuel as that of a taxi, it brings hope for the environment that so far no popular vehicle could provide. The cars will not only be protecting the environment, but also humans.

The author informs us that the driverless car has gone ""half a millon miles without a crash""(P2) which is a major factor when it comes to the health and well being of humans on and around the roadways. The author continues to talk about Google's modified car that, ""needed a whole lot of sensors""(P4) and ""had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids""(P5). To a beginning driver like myself, a car can be very overwhelming with everything and one you must beware of. The driverless cars are decked out with sensors and cameras to do exactly that. All of the sensors and montiors will help the driver and passagers continue driving without the worry of an accident unlike how driving is now. The driverless not only have smart sensors, they also have smart minds.

The driverless car comes with an extreme amount of sensors for protection but the car is also so smart, it understands when driving is beyond it's ability and that a human must drive in this area. The author tells us just how smart these cars are, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.""(P7). The driverless car is not exactly driverless yet, but it is due to the important promise that anyone in or around the driverless car will be safe.

In conclusion, the driverless car is more fuel efficent and environmentally safe compared to the vehicles we drive today. Not only is the driverless car safe to the environment though, it is also safe to all passengers and pedestrians. The driverless car has many sensors and cameras so that when it is driving, it is as if an aware human is driving instead. The driverless car does have its limits though but it is not afraid to admit it. When roadways become too difficult of the car to drive its self, the car informs the driver when his/her turn is to drive. The driverless is a fall proof, safe car to be driving on our roads today. I am personally excited and very supportive of the newest autopilot car to arrive this year in 2016, and so should you.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I do not agree with this, if students were required to take an extracurricular it may not work for everyone. Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.

Extracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to. The student may feel the need to attend every single meeting which may also cause stress or anxiety. There are two more reasons that an extracurricular activity should not be required.

Students may not like any extracurricular activity that was offered. There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list. If the student does not like any extracurricular activity they should not be forced into one. Forcing a student into an activity they do not want to do could be stressful on them or result in a violent reaction. There is a final reason why extracurricular activities should not be required.

Students may not have the time for an extracurricular activity if it is after school. Some students have things going on as soon as they get home, it could be another sport that is not in school or just going out after school. A lot of people usually don't have time for an activity that is after school if they are already in a sport that is not at the school. This could also result in not getting homework done or getting bad grades. The extracurricular activity could easily get in the way of these things a students has to do.

If a extracurricular activity was needed I do not think it should be mandatory. It could cause any of the listed things; stress and anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. I personally think these are valid reason not to require extracurricular activities.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"State senator i strongly suggest that you change the electroral speech to an election and these are some reason why you should do so. The elctoral speech has to many drematical erros that can occur and throw the whole election to a unpresidented one. Also the people that vote for a president won't be the one voting for him/her, but a slate of electros. Althought it does have an abundence of flase it does have a certainty of outcome. This could lead to a president that is wanted or was choosen by a tiny mistake that made a huge rupture in events.

With the implimation of the popular vote over the electoral college can allow citizens to express their thoughts on what new leader they would want to run their state. If they would vote on the electors it's not a one-hundred percent chance that they are willing to pick for your choice of president. '""Back in 1960, segregations in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually goneto Kennedy"". This can occur when the electors refuse to vote for their party's candidate and chooses to vote on another candidate.

Although the Electoral college has many flase that can effect the state drastically, it does have a certainty of outcome. With this it can lead to less dispute over the popular vote. ""Almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis"". Even if a state is low populated a state can cause a landslide in the Electoral-vote victory in that particular state. Also a greater factor that can occur is a tie which is possible because of the total number of votes which is an even number of 538. Even so they are two types of voting choices that people rather have, it can never be such a voting format that would be able to fit everyones style.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Even during the summer, learning new material is important for students so that they can maintain their knowledge. Therefore, requiring students to complete summer projects is a great way to allow them to keep learning even outside of school. However, these projects would be best if they were teacher-designed, rather than if they were student designed. This is because teachers would be able to provide the projects with more reliable information and content than students who most likely would not be very experienced in the content. Also, students may not put much effort into their projects if they designed it, in order to make it less difficult for themselves, whereas teachers would make sure to design the projects in a way that would allow the students to put in the effort to learn the content. Lastly, teachers would be able to make the projects both educating and entertaining in order to fit the students' desires.

Allowing teachers to design the summer projects for students would ensure that the students are provided with well-known and reliable content. For example, if the teacher were to design a math project with math problems or scenarios, it would most likely not have any mistakes and contain problems that the students would be able to solve. Whereas if the students were to design the projects that they didn't have much knowledge on, there would be a high chance that they may have made a mistake in the problems and as a result, affect their learning as well. Therefore, it would be less risky to allow these summer projects to be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are learning the right content that they need.

Many students would argue that summer break should not include any schoolwork, therefore, assigning them to create a summer project would only influence them to create a project that is not educational, which would not benefit them in learning the content. For instance, if the student were completely against doing any schoolwork over their summer break but were still assigned with designing a science project, they would most likely design the project to be effortless, so that they could get it done as fast as they could, and not teach them any content. In order to ensure that the student does put in the effort to actually learn the information, it would be more beneficial to give them teacher-designed projects, which would provide them with the right level of effort that they would need to put into their work.

In fact, a number of students do not even have much knowledge on how to create a well enough project that would best educate them. Therefore, teacher-designed projects would be able to suit the students' needs and provide them with information that would benefit them the most. In addition to this, teachers would be able to design the projects so that they could entertain the students as well as educate them. For example, the teacher could design a math game as a project, where the student could have fun playing the game as well as learn the math material. As a student just now learning the content, it would be best to have more experienced teachers create the projects in order to suit the students' level of knowledge on the specific content as well as their desire to be entertained.

As a result, summer projects should most definitely be teacher-designed, as it would be more reliable, educating and entertaining. In the long run, the students would be more likely to learn the content without any mistakes and have fun learning it as well. Even if there are still many students who absolutely object the idea of teacher-designed projects, it would be best for them to keep in mind that these projects would do more to help than hurt them in their later years of school. In addition, these projects would give those students a head start in their learning and be more beneficial to help them maintain their knowledge for the rest of their school years.         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The face on Mars is just a landform. In America we have land forms of all kinds. We have winter and so do they, so what makes it different except for the location?

It is just a rock formation without an alien monument. Landforms are not rare on other planets. Landforms come in all shapes and sizes so it just so happens to be a face.

When the scientist went back up to take picture and look at it more, they were able to take a clear picture of it. The scientist then blew it up to a bigger picture and saw that it was a natural landform. It states,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than a pixel size."" This comes to show that they will be able to see things closer and see if anything is around them. It also tell us that it actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa, which is landforms that are normal around the American West.

This tell us that it really is not something an alien could of done because it is a natural landform just like America has.

All of this evidence comes to show that it is just a landform that was created naturally. Mars landforms look like ours and is like ours. We have landforms that are different and so does Mars so it was just a coincedence that it just so happened to be a face.

"I am against the development of these cars in the article, ¨Driverless Cars Are Comming¨, because they could be dangerous. I say this because the driver has to stay alert and ready to take over the vehicle if a situation pops up. Yes, there are postive aspects to this article such as: the driver would not have to drive unless needed, it could drive the driver if they are tired (but they must stay awake), the car steers, accelerates, and brakes itself, and it displays heads-up warnings like the vibration of the seat when it is going to hit something. But hose positive things could turn ito disasters quickly. In these disasters i am about to explain the driver coould be hurt, killed, or have a lot of dept due to car dammage.

One of the many disasters that came to mind when i read this article were, the driver getting hurt or critically injured, have lots of dept due to car dammage, or even death. I say this because it is true; these things could happen. One of the examples i thought of is the situation a am about to explain. So here is the situation: The driver got tried, so they set the car to auto drive. The car taakes over and the driver is still awake. Doesn´t sound like a bad situation so far does it? The driver´s eyes start to droop, the driver tries hard not to fall asleep but fatigue wins the fight. The car does not relize this yet and it keeps driving. Then the car senses two crashes have occured just down their road. The car vibrates the seat but the driver is out light a light bulb. The car then goes for the next displaication of giving the driver a heads-up by turning the flashing lights on the windshield. Nothing. The driver is still fast asleep. The car tries all the displays to try to get the driver awake and alert again but to great avail, the driver does not wake up. The car cannot brake yet because it is not near the accidents yet; so it keeps driving.

The car then senses the accidents and breaks; but the car starts to spin out of control of black ice. It had been snowing for weeks there and it had rained the night before and it all froze. The car goes spinning out of control towards the river near the accidents. Then the worst thing happened. The car and the driver went diving into the ice cold river. The driver finally wakes up only to scream with terror right before they hit the water. The driver? head hit the stearing wheel with such an impact that it nocked them out cold. The car sunk deeper and deeper till it hit the river´s bottom. People are above them watching in terror with horrified expressions upon their faces. Some are calling for help, but the help that was there for the people in those accidents had already left. The others are just frozen with terror, unable to move.

The car begins to fill with water slowly, the water is trinkling into the car in every crack it can find. The driver still knocked out does not expect this to be thier last day to be alive, to see thier family and friends, or take a breath of air; but it is. The windows begin to crack from the pressure of the water. Up above them on the road help finally arrives, but it is only the fire rescue and the police. They do not have the right tools to go into frigid water and smash the window open or get the door to open, unbuckle the driver and break to the top of the river´s frigid waters.

The people then see small bubbles, then they become bigger and more faster to break the surface of the water. The car´s windows broke inward and the driver is dead within minutes. later the right toos were brought to the place of the new accident and they bring the car up with the dead driver inside. The driver was a huspand that had just came home from the military and was going to visit his wife and kids as a surprize. Now the family gets to see thier huspand and dad; but he is laying on a table. His skin ice cold to the touch. He is bloated some from the water, he is bruised, bones are broken, and he is dead.

I do not think that anyone who read a story like that in a newspaper or in a book would want a driverless car to be made. Anyone that has a heart would see the dangers in a driverless car coming into this world. This is why i am against the article, ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Have you ever been stuck in a position where you need advice? Then even when you may get advice from someone and it seems helpful, it ends up not getting you anywhere. Getting advice from a lot people rather than just one or two could really help your situation a lot. First of all it provides more healthy opinions to your decision on how you go about your problem. Second you are then able to compare and contrast the opinions you are given to find what works best. And finally you get a wider range of thoughts and points of view that will open up your mind to more ways of fixing this problem.

When you are provided with more than one or two opinions it leads you to being able to decifer the right from wrong and what your next move is. Sometimes you will receive an opinion that is totally different from the others. This is actually extremely helpful and would help you open up your mind and realize more ways to go about your issue. One other thing that may happen is someone may tell you something that is against what others have been telling you. For example if most people tell you to talk to a trusted adult, and then this one person says to only rely on your friends. Then you may realize that not everyone you talk to knows what they are saying. My final example is the chance that if people are talking to you as if what they say are facts, sometimes you may need to double check on that stuff. Receiving more than one opinion works somewhat like a fact checker and helps you realize if someone may be telling you false so called ""facts"". Being provided with multiple opinions not only allows you to open up your mind it will really show you the right advice from the wrong advice. With only one opinion you wouldn't be able to recognize these things as easily.

Having multiple advisors allows you to compare and contrast the advice you obtain. If it seems like there is repeats or everyone is saying the same thing, then go with that thing that is repeated. When the majority think that it is the best possible solution there's a good chance it actually is the best possible solution. Another thing that may happen is the advice may go back and forth and you are getting a lot of both sides or both opinions. Then in this case you can see which side has more experienced people giving you that opinion. For example lets say I am doing a school project and want to figure out how to organize it. Would I use my two younger siblings advice even though they have never done this type of school work, or would I take advice from my parents and older sibling who have experience. The answer is obvious, even though there are almost an even amount of people on both sides, you stick with who has experience. Finally my favorite way of using comparing and contrasting the advice. If you have a bunch of different opinions and none of them really match up or there are no patterns and repeats, you get to make it. In this case you can pick and pull parts from all the advice and build your own advice for yourself based off of other people's ideas. Being able to compare and contrast the advice you receive gives you a big advantage on how you want to deal with your issue.

You would receive more than one point of view by doing this and therefor a wider range of ideas. This completely opens up your mind to may ways to go about this. You are no longer stuck to just your own point of view. This can also get you to act on your problem in a more creative way. This happens because when you are opened up to so many points of view it lets you be basically unrestricted in problem solving ideas. One other thing that goes along with this advantage is that you could lead to an invention. Inventions are just ways to get around a problem in life. When we receive multiple points of view like this is opens up our creativity and problem solving to a wider array of options. One of those options could be something totally new, which would be an invention. Receiving multiple points of view and a wider range of ideas is in my opinion the best part of getting advice from more than one person. That is because it can lead to so many good ways of fixing your problem and opening up your mind to realize new ways of solving your issue.

Getting advice from multiple people rather than one person proves to have a massive advantage. It leads you to a larger supply of opinions which help you narrow down your options. It allows you to compare your pieces of advice which leads to the best most specific way of dissolving your crisis. And last it provides with you with an open eye or a larger point of view on how you would like you fix this.

"From reading the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", I have figured out that driveless cars have been a long time coming. People have been thinking and working on them for years now. There are pros and cons to driveless cars. For the most part driveless cars would not be a bad idea to throw into the world. If driveless cars passed the laws, you would not have to do much work going places, with time the cars are going to get better and more high tech, and they seem to be safe.

Someone gets into their car and does not have to worry about touching the steering wheel, they just have to turn the car on. That is what it would be like if driveless cars come in the future. The family or a person can just sit in their car without paying attention to the road. On the other hand, a person does have to pay some attention to the cars actions because the car might need their help. For the most part, driveless cars would make life more easy-going. Some people dread having to drive long distances to get to the location they are going to but with driveless cars, it would be no trouble to hop in the car and sit in there while the car does it all for you.

The best part about technology is it is always improving. People are always discovering better ways to do things and improvements in how to do those things. With driveless cars, they can be doing many tests on them and trying out different ways til they get the driveless car reliable for people to trust. Everything improves over the years and driveless cars are one of them. In the future, people are going to find more advanced ways to put in the driveless car to make it a better, more trusting car.

Only a hand full of states are allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Most states have concerns but some states are willing to work with the manufactorers. If more states allow their state to test computer-driven cars, it would make it easier to find ways to improve on the car. Driveless cars are a big deal and they need to be the safest they can be for the roads they will be on. So far the driveless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves and it is only 2016. The future holds so much more.

Although there are many things that need to be worked on before they let driveless cars on the road, it is a good idea to keep improving the vehicles. If people keep working hard at it, no telling what the driveless car will be like over the years. It is important to make the best car possible. There is already so many great things going for the driveless car. If they keep testing the cars and finding ways to make it better, it will eventually make a very safe driveless car.

"The author has sort of a dream of going to Venus. He claims that it is possible because they're both epual in size and similar in some areas.

Besides the point Venus can reach up to extreme levels of heat from how close it is to the sun and all the fumes or carbon dioxide. Speakin of carbon dioxide majority of Venus think atmosphere is almost 97percent carbon dioxide. Reaching over 800 degrees on average, and the atmaspheris pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on Earth, it can get pretty hot.

It makes since to try to go to Venus, because we want to know if there is anymore life out there besides Earth, it makes since, but Venus would almost be impossible for a while until we get more/better technology to travel to any other planets. We might try to go to other planets before that on because it would be impossibly to try to live or stay there. We are more likely to go to Mars before any other planet, because it is also similar to earth, but atleast it not super hot like either Venus, or Mercury.

We want to see if there are any other life out there so we want to try to go to other planets to try to see whatelse is out there, and as the author wants us to try to go to Venus, might not be possible for a while, but I think it will be possible soon. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Phone & Driving

Using cell phones while driving is a world wide hazard. Everyone knows that using a cell phone while driving is a terrible idea. People still think that drunk driving is more dangerous than being on your phone while driving. But you're more likely going to get into accidents if you're on your phone while driving than drunk driving. Most people use cell phones while driving because they self-esteem feeds off social media. They want to stay up to date and see if there's any negative or positive feedback on there photos. They post a picture 10 minutes before going into the car and while they are driving they get a notification so they pick up their phone, dying to see the comments on and they recent picture. The mostly happens around teen drivers, and it's more dangerous for them because they are inexperienced. They won't know what to-do if they ever get themself in a particular driving situation.

When a teen just get their licences they're most likely going to give their friends a ride home from school or wherever. The percentage of being in an accident increases because the odds of being distracted increases. Distracted driving is a huge problem these days, especially with the easy access to a cellular phone. Most of the time when driving, drivers have younger people and young children in the car with you. Being older than these people, you are, in many respects, a role model to them. Most of the time they can't do better because when they parents are driving with them, they're on their phones so they follow.

some times, it can be very easy to forget that the road is for everyone that can drive and not just for you. Sometimes driving pickup their phone for a minute and then they get too deep into the drama and forgets all about driving and the traffic. They also have slower reaction time to if they were to ever get into an accident. By time they should look up and have to step on the breaks, the car had already hit another car or already ran off the road. As new people start to drive, they start using cellphones and they just add them-self to the amount that's already doing. Checking your phone for messages, snaps, tweets, etc is a serious distraction. It can be fatal and the victim be seriously injured.

It can claim innocent lives and it should be banned. By doing this, it will lower the accidents caused by cell phone usage while driving. It's also bad for the drivers too because if a driver hit another driver it's going to cost them a lot. They insurance is going to pay for all the damage he/she'd cause and the repair of the victims cars and the monthly insurance payment is going to skyrocket. Every state should pass some new and more effective laws so that it could teach drivers that text and drive a lesson.

No driving should be able to text and drive or be on their phone while behind the steering wheels of a vehicle period. It's one of the most dangerous driving Distraction that could take the lives of innocent people. It could cost you a lot just by looking at your phone for a second, and increases your insurance bill. Texting and driving is a horrible idea and no one should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. If someone decides to disobey this law they should be punished fairly for the crime of breaking the law.   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.

To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class

On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.

Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.

In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape. I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

You should consider a vote from all staff and students to help you decide on weather or not cellular devices should be allowed period. Some friends and I have talked about your decisions, and have decided that policy number one would be perfectly fine with out questioning. That being said here is something to convince you that the first policy is the best choice.

If students were allowed to use cellular devices during their lunch and free hours only, they could use the cellular device to help with school work, and contact teachers and friends. To help understand I have come up with an example to help you see why this policy make sense. You have a student who has trouble doing homework at home because of the environment at his/ her home. so they decide to complete their homework during their lunch/ free hours. While doing a math problem they get stuck and can't figure out the answer to the equation and a calculator is no where near... If they were allowed to use there phone they could possibly use the calculator that has been pre- programmed into it. It's happened to students before and it will definitely happen again.

That wasn't the best example but it sounded very convincing to myself, so if you could please just think this over and definitely consider a vote from the school. It would be worth the time.

thanks, your fellow student,

"Dear State Senator,

Keeping the electoral eollege method shouldn't be appropriate for electing the next president. In source two it says that when you use the electoral college system and you vote,not only do you vote not only for one person but other people pledged to that person. Now,I don't think it's the best idea to choose this method despite it being a more simple process but using the popular vote method sounds more fair,source two also says that someone won the popular vote but the electoral college prevented him from becoming the next president. The electoral college causes too much confusion,its unfair and it's caused more problems with voting.

Although,using the elctoral college method is more simple,it can cause a lot of confusion. If you vote for one person then you automatically vote for the other people pledged to that person. Many people who have ran for persident have lost due to the electoral college method but they've won the popular vote. Its possible that when you are voting you don't know who else you're voting for.

To continue with,the electoral college method can be unfair because of the people who lost due to the system. Some people that ran for president won the popular vote but lost the electoral college vote. Others also lost because of the ""winner-take-all"" system,it awards every elector to the winning presidential candidate.

This method has caused problems with voting because of it being unfair. Some of the problems its caused was how others win automatically if the president they pledged to won the electoral college vote. This method of voting has to go.

In conclusion,the electoral college voting system shouldn't be used again in the future becasue of its confusion. It can have you voting for someone pledged to the preisdent that you didn't wan to vote for. It can also be unfair. Many people lost because of this method but won the popular vote. Last it's caused too much problems as a voting system in general.                             ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"People have been driving for many years. Cars today have evolved dramastically since the first car came out. Since we have new technology, it means that we have more non-fuel efficient cars. We need to think of a way to cut out all the negative things that cars give us. Paris, for example is banning cars that have an even numbered license plate on Monday. Bogota, Columbia is also banning cars and telling people to find an alternative transportation. Lastly Vauban, Germany is demanding to be ""car-free"".

Paris has had days of near-record pollution, so they had to think of a plan to reduce the pollution in the air. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home of pay a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the crime.

In Bogota, Columbia millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during the car-free day. This day has been going on for 3 years. People faced $25 fine if they violated this event. Citizens were saying that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower the air pollution"". Parks and Sports Centers have been built, old un-even sidewalks have been smoothed out and rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In Vauban, Germany residents of this upscale community are giving up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experiment of being car-free. Car ownership is allowed but there are only 2 places to park; large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space for 40,000, along with a home. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here.

Even though many people still own cars, they still give off bad things for our enviroment. Many cars produce a gas that is bad for the air. Many countries have banned cars on certain days to cut down on air pollution. Paris makes you pay a fine if you are caught driving a car on a certain day. Bogota, Columbia has a specific day that cars are banned and you have to find a different way of transportation. Lastly, Vauban, Germany is demanding to be car-free and have certain ways to have cars but pay for them. If we can keep making acceptions of taking different ways of transportation then maybe we can cut down on air pollution for good.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Cell phones have some way of taking our full individual attention for however long we allow it to. We become easily distracted and connected to our phones. People usually look at it just to look at it, without any notifications popping up, solely based on us humans being attracted to our phone. There also is that part of us using our cell phones to stay in the mix, see what's hot on Instagram, or if that hot guy or girl posted on Snapchat. There are many times and places you could multitask with your phone. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with because slip-ups while driving are very unforgiving. One minor mistake on the road can cause your life or someone else's life to be taken. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

Fatality is an occurrence of death by accident. Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (""On the Road).

Nearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). In 2016, 3,450 fatalities were caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). Also one out every four car crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Statistics). In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of others.

Texting and driving is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is the most common and dangerous thing you could do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk (""On the Road""). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is.

Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving""). Steering control while distracted is 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving"").

In 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distracted driving resulted in approximately 2,600 deaths in 2002 (""Texting while driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous). The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities (Masters, ""Texting While Driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous?). Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving drunk.

Texting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise. According to a group of researchers, they found that some kind of texting law leads to a 2.3% decrease in fatalities for all drivers. Specifically banning teen drivers from texting reduced traffic deaths in that group by 11 percent (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In conclusion, texting and driving could ultimately cause you unnecessary fees, or big time in prison.

In summary, drivers should know that they are dealing with something serious when driving a car. There are limited chances in life;texting and driving are pushing those chances away. Drive with the intent and purpose to get to your destination. Deal with texts after or before you drive, because it could cost you everything. Attention is highly needed when driving, there are split-second decisions to be made while driving and your phone distracts your attention enough to potentially cause accidents. Your reaction time is based on how early you see it, looking at a phone prohibits you from reacting. In conclusion, put your phone away while driving to save lives!

"Phones & Driving

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't cut the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they were talking to and that it doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call for when there is an emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in-car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is AirIQ. AirIQ is a service that if an accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while AIRIQ is always ready to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.

"I believe that the school cell phone policy should be that all students should have their cell phones off at all times at school because it keeps them focused on their work and having a cell phone could get them in trouble.

First of all keeping your cell phone off at school enables students to focus completely on their work. For example if we could have our cell phones out nobody would be thinking of the lesson or would even bother to tune into the class because obviously a phone is a perfect way to chat with your friends while the teacher isn't looking. This makes it difficult for the person sending the messages AND the one receiving them because both are having their attention pulled away from what's important (class) and what's not (socializing). Another example is even if the rule says that cell phones can only be used during free time students will be using them all the time ignoring the rule. Honestly anybody can quickly put the phone under the table and text a quick message to their friend but in that short second the teacher could've been explaining something crucial to the development of the students skills. And just missing that one little thought the student is now behind because of it. As you can see cell phones will be a major disruption to the students if allowed for them to have them in school.

Second of all having a cell phone will most likely cause you to get in trouble. I know one of my friends did. He thought he was so slick that he could just take out his cell phone and try to cheat on a test with another person. He asked for the answers to the questions on the test and while he was busy typing it out little did he know that the teacher was watching him the whole time. The teacher had to stop everybody that was taking the test and had to figure out who was cheating. After that his phone was token away from him and was in major trouble. Not only was it not worth it to get in trouble for this but it distracted the whole class and academically took away from everybody's experience. Yet another time that someone got in trouble was when my friend decided to send explicit text messages to his girlfriend. Now if that wasn't bad enough he did it during class, when everybody was watching. Now he didn't caught on his end but when the girlfriend received the message someone heard it and said something. The teacher then confiscated the phone and found the messages. She looked at who sent it and reported it to the office. Both people involved were sent to the office and were in major trouble involving parents and everything. This type of behavior would not be uncommon if the cell phone policy was instituted.

In conclusion I think we should have our phones off at all times at school because it keeps us focused on work and it keeps students out of getting into unnecessary trouble.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President; Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get 'rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article (source 2) ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida (high number) due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College.             ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Have you ever seen or ever been on Mars? Most of you might have not, but studying Mars is a part of my job. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.

My first reason is because aliens do not exist. There has been much research in this world to prove that aliens do not exist, but still some people believe that there are aliens. Whenever something weird happens in space, we always have to say aliens exist, and there is a lot of proof that they don't. On Mars, landforms can change, just like any other planet. For example, in 1976 it started out by looking like a bump. Then in 2001, it warped into many different shapes with cracks or ridges in it, and in the end it turned out looking like a face.

My second reason is because NASA has proved that it is a natural landform. It says in paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they recieved the photo it revealed a natural landform. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. So, the Face was proved to be a natural landform in the end.

My third reason is because the Face looks like landforms on Earth. In paragraph 12 it states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the Americian West."" This tells us that the Face is common and not a shockingly new landform. Also, in paragraph 12 it says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, the Face is obviously not a new thing, because Earth has a landform very similar to it. Landforms are made naturally and it takes many years to start noticing the changes in a landform.

Some people might say that aliens are real and that over the years they have been working on this landform. They could also say that NASA rarely goes over the Face because it is so hard to find, so NASA never sees the aliens because of this reason. This is all true, except that aliens are real; there is no true proof of knowing if aliens are real or not, but they most likely aren't. Also, NASA has proved that the Face isn't a new landform, but that it is similar to many landforms on Earth.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.      ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In paragraph 2 it was stated that Google cars aren't truly driverless. Also in paragraph 7 it was said that none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless and humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel. Finally in paragraph 9 it asks who would be responsible if technology fails. I'm against driverless cars.

Humans need to know how to drive a car for simple actions. In paragraph 2 it says divers sometimes need to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as roadwork or accidents.

Stated in paragraph 7 none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless and humans need to stay alert. Human need to know how to drive a car incase technology fails or an emergency. If a human doesn't know how to drive a car and relies on the car and you're in a dangerous situation, then the driver and passengers are most likely to be killed. A human needs to know how to navigate through work zones and around accidents. The Google Car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Safety is the number one most important thing when being in a car. It's the drivers job to make sure everyone in the car and themself is safe. If someone is injured or technology fails, who is at fault- the driver or the manufactuer? Trafiic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

I'm against driverless cars because Google cars aren't truly driverless, humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel, and who would be responsible if technology fails.           ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Every student has their own way of learning to finish their goals in life. That means enrolling in online classes might be the best option for their future. Online or long distance learning would benefit kids because it is very flexible, can be used everywhere, and creates fewer chances of bullying or unwanted peer pressure.

Not all families are fortunate enough to send all their kids to school everyday. Some teenagers might have to work instead of schooling just to help their families survive. Online classes can be done at anytime of the day and can even be pushed back to compensate for lost time. This would help students all around the world learn, study, and become the type of person they want to be later on in life. Letting the next generation be smarter and stronger will create new opportunities for generations after that and so on.

In some areas, schools are very far apart from one another and students have to travel far distances in order to attend them. In more rural places, kids have to walk to and back from school. To combat this, online classes would diminish the trek and let students work from anywhere they please. This would not only benefit the students, but also ease the minds of all the people that care for the student's safety. If more kids could be able to learn about modern day problems and solutions, the world would become a better place.

Many kids suffer from bullying in school, and they have to put up with it because they can't just walk out of school anytime they want. This leads to depression and anxiety later on in life. Millions of teenagers these days have to deal with the terrible parts of the day just to be able to learn and have a chance at a brighter future. If some kids that suffer from this took classes online where they feel safe and secure, the chance of experiencing depression or overall sadness wouldn't be affecting them as much. I believe if this was possible for all students, that the rate of high school dropouts would decline and the number of high school graduates would be exponentially higher.

Even though some kids might not have the chance or ability to take classes at home, I strongly agree that taking online school would benefit the masses. I have not only seen it my life, but I have heard that many people love online schools. Being able to take online classes or video conferencing would be positive for students because of its ability for them to choose the time of which they learn, place of where the want to learn, and who they want to learn with. Sure this might be a challenge for some kids or parents, but the benefits out weigh the consequences a hundred times over. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Mr. Principal,

I have heard of your potential decision to require community service from all students. (I am assuming that the students we are referring to are older than elementary school age.)

The details of the requirement have not yet been released to us yet, but if the time you require is more than six hours a week, I oppose the decision to make it an obligation. I do not think that students should be made to do this. The choice to perform a service for the community is definitely one that should be encouraged, but should remain a choice. The reason I think this is because many students have other responsibilities they must use the time to do. If you require them to do community service, their other responsibilities will have to be put on hold until they can get back to them. Some of their activities that they need the time to do may be personal, for example, visiting a sick relative. Others are for their education, like going to an internship (for high school aged students). Either way, this decision will affect how your students will have to manage their schedules after school hours.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I agree with this statement because if students were to participate in sports, they would be more fit and active. I agree with this a lot because i used to not really do anything in gym but then i started running and I noticed how fast I run so I kept doing it and i go a little bit skinnier and a little bit faster.

Working on the yearbook is also something i'd agree with because it could either make the student feel good or wanted and that goes for any extracurricular activity. Im pretty sure that if you help working on the yearbook you probably get to edit some of it in your own way.

Serving on the student council is a good thing to do because you're serving them food and its also a great thing to do because it makes you feel happier and makes them feel blessed, thankful, and boost their moods. Im kinda used to this because i worked at a homeless shelter and i had to feed the homeless people and almost every single time i served them food they'd always feel so blessed and thankful to get the food.

I think another extracurricular activity is reading because your doing something you don't normally do. But I think students should read to get more knowledge and grow a bigger imagination because I remember i read diary of a wimpy kid books back when i was 11 and it made me feel more positive about myself, made me accept who i am, and especially made my imagination grow a lot.

These are all of my reasons why I agree with the principal with participating in at least one activity.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The future is progressing, the internet is being used so much that most people would not know what to do without it. the internet is being used for education, jobs, and just for pure entertainment. It can be a very controversial topic weather or not the internet is benefiting or hurting young kids, especially at school. I believe that students would benefit from taking online classes at home because you could attend school even when you're sick, you could learn in a less stressful environment, and truly everyone could get an education. Although I do not think that it's the best option for everybody and we should still have school buildings and in person education, it will still benefit the people that do believe that online school is the best option for them.

One of the most stressful things for a high school student is missing classes and having to make up a bunch of work because you were sick. With online school you wouldn't have to worry about missing class and dealing with that looming stress when you should be resting. You would be able to rest, and do you're classes, on your own terms instead of going to school sick and infecting your peers with whatever illness you've contacted. This is also a great idea for kids that have a long term illness' and normally would have to be taken out of school. They could continue with the same classes just not at their school and they wouldn't have to deal with the stress of getting a new teacher.

In Generation Z, a common problem is mental illness, especially anxiety and depression. This makes the social aspect of school difficult for some people and they would most likely learn better at home where they feel the most comfortable. Although this is a great alternative for older students, I believe this reason should not be applicable to younger children, such as elementary schoolers, because it could harm the crucial social skills that they learn at that time that they might need later in life. I believe this would make the county's GPA level sky rocket because not all people focus best in an environment such as school.

My last point to make is that the education rates in the US would rise if people were given the option to take online school. One of the biggest reasons why people don't have their degree is because they had to be removed from school to work and make money for their families. By taking online school, they would have more time to work and provide for their families, while also getting their high school degree to find an even better job or seek even higher education. If this option was put in place, I believe that the graduation rates would sky rocket and the drop out rate would lower drastically.

Having the option to learn at home would not only benefit the student as an individual, but it would benefit the county that they're in and their families or future families. Giving students the choice to learn at home, or wherever they choose to learn, could possibly open up a new liking for education that the student had never felt before and make the student find what their interested in and what they want to pursue in life. Online education truly benefits everyone, and if there's a choice between online or regular school, it wouldn't hurt anyone either. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly believe that this will benefit students if they attend classes from home. Some people think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. However I strongly believe this will benefit students if they attend classes from home. There are several reasons for that: first, students can save their time by attending classes from home.

Second,some students learn better by seeing and by working alone.

Third,students can have more time with their parents.

First, students can save their time by attending classes from home. They don't have to wake up early in the morning to get the bus, to shower, and etc. By saving time they can sleep more; if they sleep more they will pay attention to what they are doing. There is so many students those fail their classes just because they don't pay attention in the class. For example if teachers ask them why they are not paying attention most them answer ""i didn't have enough sleep."" So Students can save their time by attending their classes from home.

Second, some students learn better by seeing and by working alone. They pay more attention to their work when they are alone. If they pay more attention to their work; they will pass with good grades. Some Students graduate early from high schools just because they pay more attention to their work. Some students learn better by seeing and by working alone.

Third,students can have more time with their parents. Some parents don't want leave their kids alone; they always text their kids while their kids are in the school. For example some parents think school is not safe for their kids; they always worry about them. So students can have more time with their parents.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that this will benefit students if they attend classes from home. Some people think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Students can save their time by attending school from home. They can spend for time with their parents. I strongly believe that this will benefit students if they attend classes from home.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Imagine you are relaxing on the beach, enjoying a wonderful vacation with your family and friends. When suddenly, your music is interrupted by an email from your Spanish teacher that your summer assignment is due at 12:00 am. You had completely forgotten about your summer assignment and need to quickly hurry to get it done before the deadline. Although some say student-designed summer projects are better and easier, actually teacher-designed summer projects are far more superior.

It can be clearly said that students have full capacity to design their own projects and make sure it does not over-exceed their limits. Students designing their own projects can allow them to make sure it does not affect their daily live and that will entice them to actually do the project. For example, when teachers assign a project, it can feel as though the teacher is being inconsiderate because they might have given them a difficult project. Another example is the fact that the teacher's design might not be comprehensible to the student and could be too vague or too complicated for the student to understand.

The reason I believe summer assignments should be designed by teachers is because of the structure and perfect context. I do believe students are capable of designing projects themselves, however, students sometimes lack the ability to give enough context in anything they design. Teachers always design a project or assignment that can be completed by anyone and that it should not overwork the students. Teachers have the ability to include more context and give an ideal project to any student. For example, teachers give full and proper directions when introducing the project and can always explain the context behind what they are asking the student for. Another example would be the fact that teacher always make it simpler than it really should be for the student to complete the project they are given.

In addition to support my argument, teachers have no control over the students time management skills. As I stated before, teachers make the projects fitted to accommodate every students schedule. Not to mention the fact that they also would like to enjoy their summer and are well aware that their students would rather have nothing interfere with their summer activities. Teachers do not assign projects for fun, but they assign them because of the fact that they want their students to remember at least something they did in a classroom. For example, teachers never assign anything during the summer that can't be done in less than ten minutes . Another example would be that teachers take time out of their day to compose an email or a reminder of some sort to let the student know that their project is due soon.

In conclusion, whether it is the student that cannot manage their time properly or the teachers inability to fully explain in context what students need in their project, I still believe it is best to have teacher-designed summer projects. Although some believe it is best for students to design their projects, actually having teachers design projects is better.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"It is better to get advice from multiple people about something because everyone is different which means they could have experienced it differently. You will get different responses when you ask for advice and it can help you open your eyes more about the situation. It is a lot better to get advice from more than one person because of those reasons. Hearing about multiple opinions from different people can help you think about the situation more clearly.

Getting advice from others is better when they have gone through the same thing already so they understand what it's like and what to do about it, while the ones who don't understand could give you the wrong advice. And it's okay to get advice sometimes because a certain situation can stress you out and you would not know what to do. You should not get stressed about a situation because it can be bad for you so it is easier to get help from others because no one should have to deal with stress and no one should feel alone either.

Everyone always needs a little bit of help sometimes and that is okay because it can be really hard to have to do things alone all the time. Getting advice from others who have been through the same thing can prevent you from making mistakes and regretting it later and it can make your life a whole lot easier as well. Asking for advice can help ease your stress, fix the issue, and continue to focus on what you need to do.

It is also good to ask for advice about things and it helps you open up to people. Open up to close friends or family members because they care about you a lot and they would really love to help you out. There are lots of people who really care about you and would do anything for you in a heart beat. So it's really good for you to open up to others and tell them about what you are dealing with and how you feel about it and it creates a bond between you and the other person which is good too.

No one should be or feel alone because it can make them feel like they can not ask for help. It is good to open up to people a lot because it makes them feel like they can open up to you as well. Always get advice from those who are very very close to you because if they are not, they could probably give you bad advice and then you would end up making mistakes because of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"A few months ago, I had a simple, yet an impactful decision to make. I either hung out with some friends, or studied for a big geometry test. Obviously, I decided to hang out with my friends. I ended up failing the test. Had I of decided to seek multiple opinions, I probably would have studied, and passed. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Getting just one opinion is typically not extremely helpful. By asking just one person's thoughts, it is likely that they can choose the worst possible choice. However, you would not even know since you did not bother to discover how other people feel on that certain topic. Had you asked another person, they could have shown you the best conclusive option.

Another reason seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, is that it can help you truly figure out how you feel about a specific topic. For example, I was at a restaurant with my family. However, I could not decide what I desired to eat. I gave my parents my two favorite options: the pasta or a hamburger. They ended up saying I should get the pasta, but I did not stop there. In addition to asking my parents, I decided to ask the waiter when he came to receive our order. I asked if I should get the pasta, or a hamburger. He suggested the pasta. For some reason, that enabled me to clearly see I did not want the pasta, but instead the hamburger. Having others opinions helped me see that a hamburger was the best choice for me.

One may not realize it, but some people just have more wisdom retained compared to others. For example, asking your grandmother's opinion, according to statistics, will help you choose the right option eighty-eight percent of the time. Compare that to asking a toddler, who, typically are on average not fully potty trained until the age of two and a half. They have not even been a live for half of a decade. You will quite clearly get an answer with experience behind it from your grandmother, as opposed to a toddler.

Making decisions by yourself can be very difficult. That is why discovering other people's stances on topics can benefit you in choosing the better choice. Do not settle with one person's opinion. Take the effort to make the best choice, for it can impact many others, including you. Finally, I hope you have learned that you cannot just ask one person's opinion, for that may stray you on the wrong path, which you could be stuck on, for the rest of your life.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I am aware of the your dilemma about the cell phone policy. i think you should let the students use their cell phones during free times such as lunch time and other free times. i believe that was your first choice. i think that's the best choice because schools have such a tight grip over students these days since they don't have recess anymore (middle school& high school kids) I think we should let them us cell phones during free periods. If their parents loosen the leash at home who are we to tighten it up here. plus if we don't let students have theirs cell phones at school what if their was an emergency when they have to call their parents or the police or someone of importance and we cant reach them because the don't know the number and picks up. so theirs know reason we should stop the kids from bringing the cell phones to school so. so i strongly agree with the first choice.

"Every Summer, as school is nearing an end, the other students and I are ecstatic to have some of our future teachers come into our classes and tell us about what we have to look forward too after the break ends, as well as finding out what lesson we will cover, fun projects, and the supplies we should for the class. What does not please any student however, is when they find out that they have to finish a lengthy assignment before their summer ""break"" is over. Created by teachers who have no idea of your level of learning, nor who you are, students will inevitably feel overwhelmed. The students taking the classes themselves should created the assignment,as even though the teachers may make the plans for the class, these students understand where the new students are coming from as well as the challenges faced inside the class.

Although teachers try to fill their summer assignments with care, they fail to understand what the students they are getting actually know. Just because the students should have learned everything from the previous year, most of the time other factors would come into play. Some material was overlooked due to time constraints, while some material was discarded in the depths of the students mind as they felt like they would need it. Nothing felt worse than having a lecture by a ne teacher a material we should have learned the year before, but no one at all could remember it. Having the upperclassmen, who were inside similar shoes to the newer students, make the assignment, they would reinforce what the students will have to know walking into the class day one. Upperclassmen would also be able to address through the assignment what material they never learned that the students would need for the beginning of the school year. Even though the teacher should plan for the students to not have learned all the information from previous years, the upperclassmen, through experiencing the class would be better able to give specifics on what future students need to know before school

Even though the teacher makes the lesson plans for the year, the previous students remember what is actually important for the class. Many times before, upperclassmen have been able to help me through classes by giving me advice on what material was important for the final tests of the year, ranging from simply names of people we have studied about, to entire units that made up big portions of the test. Some times the teacher might skip entire portions of the class, causing the students to miss out on very critical information. Having students create summer assignments allows them to fill students on what they have to know for the year. Instead of being surprised by content they would have never known about, the summer assignment would serve as a guide for the year, preparing new students for what to come. Some may argue that it is the teacher job to prepare the students, and create summer assignments to reflect the year, but the students who took the class ultimately know what the students will need to pass the final tests.

By understanding and experiencing the challenges the class faced before and during the school year, The upperclassmen would be able to create a better summer assignment for the new students. throughout school, not only have i sought out upperclassmen, but underclassmen have came to me asking for advice on classes or help studying. Students for a bond with one another, despite the grade level, in order to survive in the educational ecosystem.

They could use it to see if the suspect is lying by if his face shows worry, fear, surprise, anger or discust. All of those feelings and emothions could be helpful and valuable to figure out a case.

I believe policy one would be the better choice for several reasons. first and foremost some times we need to use our cell phones during school.

What would you do if you got in an accident and no one could contact your child's school to tell them they would need another form of transportation home? What would you do then? If they were allowed their use their cell phones during lunch period you could easily contact them and make sure they got home safely.

Another reason is what if your child got sick at school and went to the nurse but the nurse said they were fine, if your child still doesn't feel well they would be able to contact you and you cold come pick them up. What if your child has asthma and they need their inhaler ,the school doesn't have one. You child could call you and tell you to come bring it for them in their time of need.

"Dear Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME. It would be beneficial to keep the electorial college because it is in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congree and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, if we used just popular vote candidtates would just go to bigger states like Florida, California, Texas, and Georgia and win the popular vote, and lastely without the electorial college there would be a greater chance of a dispute.

Five reasons to keep the electiorial college are:

1. Certainty of Outcome

A dispute over the outcome of an Electorial College vote is possible but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote because the winning candidate's share of the Electorial College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Almost all states award electorial votes on a winner take all bases.

This means that if a president wins 51 percent of a states popular vote they win 100 percent of the Electorial votes.

In the 2012 election Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote, but only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.

Althought a tie in the electorial vote is possible because there is an even 538 votes it is highly unlikely.

2. Everyone's President

The Electorial College requires a presidential candidater to have a trans-regianal appeal, what this means is that no regian has enough electorial votes to elect a president.

Therefore a president with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful.

If the president could win the electorial vote with just one regions votes the other regians would feel disenfranchised and feel that the president wouldn't care about what they want or need.

3. Swing States

The winner-take-akk method of awarding electorial votes makes candidates focus on states called swing states.

These voters in the swing states are most likely to bve the most thoughtful voters and they are the ones that decide most elections.

An example of a swing state is Florida.

Florida always changes between Republican and Democrat and having 29 electoirial votes that is a big deal.

4. Big States

The electorial College gives back some of the weight in big states that they lose in the senate where every state has only 2 representatives.

Florida is also a big state having 29 electorial votes.

This makes Florida even more attractive to candidates to visit because it is both a swing state and a big state.

5. Avoid Run-Off Elections

The Electorial College avoids a problem in which no candidate receives a majority of the vots cast.

The Electorial College takes away that complication by providing a clear winner.

Lastley if popular vote was used candidates wouldn't have to go to a variety of states, they could go to the same big states including California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Washington.

Just winning the majority of these states they could win the whole election.

This would cause smaller states like Ohia, North and South Dakota, and Michigan to not be a piece of the election as much because of their low population.

I hope this helps you decide what to do about the decision between Electorial College and Popular Vote.

Think about the smaller states.

They don't want to be left out.

Thanks,

"Students are often required to complete projects during their summer vacation to ensure they are continuing to learn and practice a subject. Teachers, those who assign and grade the projects, are the experts when it comes to their course. Students need to learn to think outside the box, and having the pressure to come up with their own assignment can be stress-inducing. While some may think students would be allowed more creative room if they made their own summer assignments, I believe teachers should design their students summer projects.

Teachers go to college to earn their education in a specific field in which they would like to teach. Therefore, they spend years upon years learning how to teach that subject of choice. They become experts. In no way is this to discredit the students, as for many, they eventually become very knowledgable in said subject. However, when asked who knows more about a class, it is without a doubt, the teacher. Therefore, why would a student be asked to create a summer assignment when the teacher is the expert in the course? The teacher knows the subject material, so they would also know what would be the most beneficial towards improving a student's knowledge on the course. The students are creative; however, they aren't masters, so they shouldn't be pressured to create their own project.

While some may argue this negates the students ability to express creativity, I believe this forces them to be more open minded. I was once assigned a project in my art class that required using colored pencils to create an abstract piece. I had no experience with the medium or style or artwork; I would have never chosen either. However, this project subsequently became my favorite pieces I've ever made. If one is presented with an assignment they find challenging and undisierable, they are then forced to use creativity to work with it. Rather than recieving the option to make a project they know will be good at and find easier, they are given something they have to work with. This, alone, allows them to make controlled choices about how they choice to complete an assignment.

The ability to choose allows freedom; however, in some cases, choice arrouses anxiety. When a student is posed with the freedom to create whatever assignment they would like over the summer, they may have no idea what to do. If every student has the ability to design different projects ,all completely different, they won't be able to work together or ask questions. While school is out, they most likely won't be able to ask their teachers for help one their summer projects. The stress is taken off their shoulders if they know their isn't another option, esspecially if they don't actually want to make their own assignment.

Summer projects are beneficial towards the developement of ones knowledge in a particular subject. In order for students to learn how to think critically and reduce stress, I believe teachers should design those summer assignments. Afterall, they are considered experts in their field. ",0,persuade_corpus,3

I belive this tecnology wouldn't be valuable in the classroom or learning enviroment. This technology doesnt benifit the students learning or relate to their school subjects.

Facial Action coding System can calculate human emotional expressions. It calculates how you feel or waht you are feeling. I don't think this software would be valuable in the classroom because it is invading the kids personal space. Having the teachers or the computers always knowing how you feel is creepy. In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Simle"" it states that humans perform this task or calculation of reading people's emotions everyday. The artical also states that humans most likly can tell how otheres or how their friends are feeling by looking at their faical expressings. Having Facial Acton Coding System in the classroom would just be unessasary and invading others personal space.

This software or technology only reads humans emotional expressions, it does'nt teach anything or help people learn anything benifiting to school. If this technology was to be put into classrooms it wouldnt be benifiting to the kids or teaching them anything related to their school work. The artical states that the computer would be able to tell when a student is confused or bored while doing a leason. Most schools don't even teach leasons on the computer a teacher teaches them the leason they are learning. Also some kids or even their parents wouldn't want a computer to be reading their childrens emotions 24/7, also the students may not want to be monitored all the time aswell. This technology just isn't benificial to the learning enviroment in that sort of way.

The software update, the Facial Action Coding System is cool on how it reads humans emotions and tells you how they are feeling, but it just isn't valuable to classrooms or the learning enviroment. This software invades otheres person sapce by always monitoring their emotional expressions and calculating how u feel. Some people might find it creepy on the fact they are always being read by this new technology. This new technology isn't valuable to classrooms also because it it is not benifical to kids learning. The Facial Action Coding System doesnt teach kids realting to their school subjects. Teachers teach the leasons and not computers this software would'nt be nessarsy in classrooms.                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

Do you think every body should do a extra curricular activity? Most people do activities but the school does not run them. A lot of schools dont even host good our a lot of programs. Most activities do not fit every body. After school things separate more time away from peoples family.

If someone makes the team for a sport over a kid who wants it more then that person. The student that made it gets forced to do something he docent want to do, and ruins opportunities for other kids. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.

Kids who really want's something might not be able to achieve there goal. They put in extra work and grinding for along time. Some kids might just be there to say they are on a team or program. If every one had to do one extra activity things would get packed. They have been trying there best for a lot of years and just join something for free.

People love to have freedom they like to go home play with there dog our younger siblings. next there some kids that like play video games and make money from that. Forcing kids do an activity might make sad if they get joked cause they do something wrong. Not every body parents or guardians can come pick the up after school. Theres a lot of kids out there like to do activities by them selves because it helps them focus.

Finally kids are passionate about there own activities. Having to do another activity can make some students irritated. Students are already at school for seven plus hours. Kids should follow there dreams stick to it and make new things happen.

Students would like to pro sue there own path.

At last this is why having extracurricular activities is not he brightest idea. Hope that this will put an idea principle thought. Having to do extra activity when just make the day if longer. They want to go home and live there life how they want to. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.                                ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The government claims they are for the people. In which the electoral colledge is cerrupt considering that every state doesent have the same amount of votes. Even thoe a presedent can get majority vote it wont matter because the other presedent has more votes according to the electoral colledge. Your not even voting for the presedent your voting for,a state of electors then they elect the presedent, how do you know that they are going to vote for your spacific presedent. This shows that a simple system can be rigged for failure.

Sorce 2 paragraph 11 shoes that certain electors refused to vote for there partys presedent. Popular vote is a simpler less fool proof system and should be considered if the government is trully for the people. The electoral colledge it is a very sensitive system and alot can go rong vary easyly,knowing that your vote might not actually matter can be frusturating because your relying on a nother person to vote for that presedent. We the people should change the system from electoral colledge to popular vote its only fair to the citizens that actually vote, and its more fool proof.

Sure they say that curruption happens vary rarly in this system but you cant simply trust somebodys word like that expessualy now in days. Its scary how you have to vote for a state to vote for you chosen presedent its just a longer more complicated system that can get messed up easyly. Election for the presedent is a big deal our presedent has the biggest role in the country and if we cant rely on electoral colledge because it can easyly be currupt or damaged than that could screw the whole country over.

I think we should change to popular vote because it stands more for the people and is more fool proof and can work better for a number of reasons. I hope the state senitor wold be able to take this idea in and make it work.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"98.7% of people don't want to participate in school activities because in their minds, a little voice is telling them, ""Why do school activities when there is no point in them?"" Shut that voice off and think about if school activities would actually help you in school. I strongly agree about students participating in at least one hobby because you can be helping your school out and the other people around you. Participating in a school activity can help you get a more healthier mind, raise money for your school, and help you with teamwork skills.

First of all, having a clean mind makes your body feel healthy and energized. It can make you feel less overwhelmed and help you think about other important things. School activities can help a lot with dreadful and depressed times, that is why it is a great idea to participate and have a cleaner mind. It can help with a lot of your problems and can take your mind off of a lot of things.

Therefore, participating for your school can help them raise money. The money they raise can help families in need for shelter, clothes, food, or anything they need to survive. The money can also go to book stores, clothes stores, shoes stores, toy stores, and anything families would be thrilled to have. It can put a smile on your face helping the families in need.

Lastly, partnership is a great way to fit in, it can help you make lots of new friends and explore the meaning of true teamwork. Teamwork is a good way of being respectful, for an example, if your having trouble on a sport or different hobby, someone could step in and lend you a helping hand. Working together on sports, projects, and different types of hobbies, can make a lot of things easier for you. Making new friends helps you have a fun time and makes your life a lot better.

In conclusion, having a cleaner mind, helping families in need, and having partnership skills are all great ways why you should participate in school activities. It can make you feel amazing inside when you help other people around you. Helping out your school can actually be a good feeling, it gives you a positive mind set and can help you for your future. Before telling yourself "" There is no point in school activities,"" think about how it can help you, families, friends and your school.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The limiting of cars in the world and commuinities sounds terrible but in a way its not all that bad for one reason it helps reduce smog in the area, people get more physical activity by walking and by cleaning up the city new business will come to the twon/city you live in people drive there cars everywhere they go, to the store , the mall, out to eat even if its in walkinng distance people relay on there car to get them where they need to go and this is a big problum because its creating unheathy smog in the environment that people and animals live in and by relaying on cars to get them where they need to go the people are only making the situation even worse then its becoming. Smog is like a poison fog created by cars and things of that nature and is put into the atmosphere for people to breath into there lungs and is but into there body just beacuse they ""need"" to drive where they ""have""to go in such a hurry.

when you remove cars for an extended period of time or just the day people are forced into physical activity to relay on when they have to go places like the store, the mall, out to eat ect. its good for people just to get out and exercise instead of someone saying im going to the drug store that is a 5 min walk down the road. now its alot more reasonable if the place your going in like 5 miles from where you live then yes drive but if is 5 min walk just walk its not going to kill you. even if its just biking up the road to get the mail it still beats driving for no reason on somthing you could walk/bike to get.

If you remove cars once a week, evan once a year you could clean up the town/city you live in to bring new business to the town you live in and new busnisses means new jobs so that an econome increases in the town because it been cleaned up and new busniess has be created in your town.

in these three paraghaphs ive given three great reasons why imiting cars is a great advantage and help the small towns to big cities around the world.                         ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Venus, as the author talks about, was a worthy pursuit becuase they had found very good and ineresting findings. The author believes them because they have such good outcmomes of the new findings. As the author talks about in paragaph 8 it says,""Been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus. "" This meaning to this is how many things had been tested and seen. Therefore they are dicovering new stuff in this century. Another reason is on paragrpah 8 it states,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" This is explaining how the person doesnt liked the job or does. They are passionate able the stuff they do. As they look into more of Venus, the more excitement is shown and shared. Overall, the author knows how harmful these stuff could be, but they just love how they make a discovery, which is worthy. They feel as to being one step ahead by testing them and keep testing them so they are able to come out with an outcome of something more epic and worthyly of Venus and its dicovering which made it itself a worthy pursuit.

"Is it aliens or is it a natural landform? About twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, and was taking photographs. As Viking 1 was taking photos, there was one certain photo that caught NASA's eye. A photo the seemed to look like a face. NASA believes it was an alien artifact, but it really is just a natural landform. Mars' ""face"" is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.

Thoughout the years that the ""face"" of Mars was known, there is a change of the landform. Looking at the pictures of 1976, 1998, and 2001 the landform changes. By the time of 1998 the landform has more cracks in it. On April 5, 1998 thousands of people on the web were waiting to see another picture of the land on Mars. The people were not satisfied and said it was not fair. They complained and said it was the cloudiest time of the year for the Red Planet. Yes, they realized that Mars also has wheather. The most common is the sand storms it has. The wind and sand that moves around will change that landform of the surface. The land of Mars will breakdown into even more sand. Like most planets, the land will change by its wheather. The land is caused by natural causes of wheather, not by aliens.

The ""face"" of Mars is caused by natural causes. It is caused by the wheather. Thoughout the years the land and its figure changes. Mars' face is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.",0,persuade_corpus,2

One of the reasons is because of the opportunties you have to discover new places . This is a lifetime opportunity and we want you to join us . I have been to so many wonderful places like Greece , China , Panama and Europe . Imagine if you could get the chance to go there, would you say yes to the opportunity?

You don't just get to see beautiful landmarks but you also get to help people who's homes , cities and towns were destroyed and left in ruins. To them , for helping there homes recover you would be a hero . You can take care of animals when you are on seas . Those animals are shipped to the people who's homes were destroyed .

Thats not just what you do on the job you also get to mentally help yourself . I saw the poor families that lost almost everything during World War II . You will understand that you are lucky enough to have a strong and protective country that protects you from enemies . It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years .

You really won't find it boring because Don Reist and I came up with thing to do during trips. For example we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed after they were unloaded . We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing,boxing, reading, whittling and other games that helped pass the time. You can also be creative and make up your own games .

"The Electoral College, its something that can change the amount of votes someone has rapidly depending on how many he or she has recieved. For some it is something that can help you, and for others its a nightmare. Most people would say it is something to be aware about and the rest dont care about it.

To start off, The Electoral College is not a physical builiding or place, its a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between elections of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Most people belive that this process should be eliminated, some of those protesters are or were very important people, for example Bob Dole, he once said ""

The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

""

Secondly, If someone is in the Electoral College and vote for who they want for President, really they dont vote for them, according to ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer, the people on the Electoral College actually ""vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president."" Thats messed up! They barley have any control on who they vote for. What if the electors dont vote for who the voters expect to win? Actually, this incedent has happend before in Hawaii in 1960 with two electors, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Next, The Elecotral College is widley regarded as an anachronism. According to ""In Defense of The Electoral College"" by Richard A. Posner, ""

the advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...

"". It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When people are voting for a presidential candidate, they're actually voting for a slate of electors. Its is truley unfair for that to happen because the electors can betray the presidential nominee and cast their vote for the opposing nominee.

Finally, It is entirely possible for the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. It is very rare for something like that to occur. According to ""In Defense of The Electoral College"" by Richard A. Posner, ""

It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes...""

.A tie in the nationwide electoral votes is possible because the total number of votes, which is 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Overall, The Electoral College should be removed, because when the electors cast their vote, they dont really take part in the vote, it really is the slate. Sure, it can add more votes than the nominee actually has, but it is an unfair, outdated, and irrational procces that should no longer be in the Constisution.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Participating in an extracurricular activity such as joining a school sports team will keep you active and keep you fit.

"There have been many changes in the education system over the years. One of the most common things that has been implicated into the school systems is technology. There are many benefits to adding technology to your everyday learning experience. For one, it makes the idea of online classes a reality. Most teachers have started to use sites such as Google Classroom to upload recordings of their lectures for their students. This makes it easier for the students that were not in class that day to listen to the lecture and use what they heard to stay up to date in the class. Online classes benefit students in many ways that helps them with their education.

It is widely known that the amount of students that miss school due to being sick is a high number. This causes the student to miss some of the instruction that is given in class. With online classes and video conferencing, it makes it easier for the student to take time to recover at home while not missing too much of the lesson. This would also help students that are out of school for a longer period of time for other reasons. Being on homebound is one example. While someone on homebound is assigned a teacher to meet with to be given their assignments that they miss, it also is helpful to have some of the material online for the student to look over. This makes it easier when they meet with their teacher so that they know what questions to ask if they don't understand something that the material covered. Another helpful thing online classes offer is even if the student was in the class, it gives them another opportunity to look over the lesson and study if they didn't understand it the first time they went over it the first time. Most of the students are given a computer to use during the school year. This ensures that the student has a way to access online work. Many have found this to be very helpful if they are traveling during the school year. Using the computer lets them work on their classes no matter where they are. This also makes it easier for the teacher to give out work if some of their students aren't present the day they hand out material.

While there are many benefits to using online classes to help assist students, there are also many issues that come with using an online format. Some students have found that while there are some elements that they find helpful, it is not the same as physically being in the class. Not having a teacher present while working on the lessons has proven to be difficult for some. Most of the time, if a student has a question, they email the teacher and wait for their response. However, sometimes there is no way to continue the course without getting an answer to their question. If they attended the physical class, the teacher would be able to answer their question in person and make sure the student understood what they were talking about before they continued with their work. Many students like to work at their own pace. They enjoy the option to take their time to get their work done. Yet some students benefit from having a guideline and deadlines for assignments. If someone is known to procrastinate, online classes takes a lot of dedication and effort in order to complete the course. If the student finds themself to not be as motivated about finishing, it will take longer and they will find it very difficult to finish as the work piles up. Another thing that would hinder the student's progress is the social interaction aspect of the class. While some teachers find it helpful to split up certain people in the class that are known to distract others and themselves, being social is still very important for youth. If someone is using online classes every once in a while, this will not be an issue if they are still attending the regular in person classes. However, if someone is using the online classes for a longer period of time, this might lead to them becoming less and less social.

Online courses and video conferencing can be very beneficial towards students. It gives them the chance to stay up to date with the material that they might be missing if they are home sick from school. It also helps teachers when they are giving out work to their class. This leads to both parties being able to do their job and not cause work to pile up. More schools are starting to see the benefits of this and how well it works in keeping students on track. In the end, online classes are starting to help more and more students as time goes on. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Imagine you were driving down the road one day and you see a car driving towards you. Seems normal, right? Wrong. You notice the driver is, wait he couldn't be, could he? But he is. The other driver is asleep and both of you are in a work zone. This would result in a crash and there is only one culprit. The driverless car.

We can all agree that technology has come a long way in the past few years, but has it come too far? Many companies are working on ideas for what will be a driverless car. It might seem like a really good idea at first but there are a few reasons that these vehicles would cause problems. First off, the distracted driver. If you were on a long car trip or had up late working before the trip you were making it would you be able to stay awake behind the wheel of a driverless car? We'd all like to say we would but it's not that simple. There are already drivers on long trips that mange to fall asleep while driving. Think about if they were just riding in the car how much worse it would become. The cars could pilot themselves fairly well but what if there was an accident ahead, or a workzone? The driver would have to take over to guide it through the changed route. This couldn't happen if the driver was asleep.

There would also be too many distractions while in a driverless car. People text and drive all the time already but if they didn't have to drive they wouldn't pay attention to the road at all. The companies that are making the cars are suggesting ideas of how to get the driver's attention when it is their turn to drive, but how well would it work? One of the ideas being suggested was entertainment systems built into the car that would shut off while the driver needed to take the wheel. Which isn't a bad idea until you consider the driver's own personal devices that they would bring with them.

In conclusion driverless cars are NOT safe. There are too many thing that could go wrong. The cars are not entirely to blame as much as the lack of responisbility of people, but untiil the cars can comensate for that lack of responsibilty they are not safe for roads. They need a lot more work before anyone should consider purchasing one. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In this essay I will be giving an argument on why this so called ""face"" is not made by aliens.

The prompt tells you that one of your colleagues says that it is created by aliens.

My job in this essay is to tell why it isn't and give an explanation.

The figure that NASA saw was a so called ""face on mars"".

They claimed that it was in the shape of a human head and it was thought to be made by aliens.

In my oppinion this is not made by aliens.

Here is a reason why.

All these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens.

Throughout the years how many have we found, none!

Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms.

There is no way to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none.

Look down on earth.

How many mesas or Buttes do we have in America, or even around the world?

Now think about this, were these man made?

No, none of these land formations were man made!

They are formed naturally by nature.

Now over the years we have found a lot of reasons how Mars is sort of like the earth.

It carries water, and it is one of the easiest planets to get to, so if you think about it, Mars could have the same land formations as we do!

Nature is a beautiful thing, and it more than likely made this so called ""face"".

Yes, you may be right in some way.

Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.

This COULD have been made by aliens.

Maybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.

That is the only argument that you have against me.

The argument that isn't even factual.

You are going off of a guess in your mind.

So overall in this essay I have covered three thing.

I have covered my first argument, which is that we have not found aliens even though we have been searching all of these years.

I have covered my second argument, which is that nature has formed many structures like this on earth, it could have been formed out of the land.

And I also covered the rebuttle, which is that there is a possibility that this was built by aliens because we have found traces.

So in conclusion, this structure was not built by humans, this was land made. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S should stick with the Electoral College because its a game changer and trust worthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article "" In Defenese of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of  popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this peice of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indfensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought Bradfort disagrees with the method, Bradfort still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game chnager on Election Day.

Futhermore the Electoral College is just a trust worthy method to use. Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college  represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I think that students should bring phones to school but turn then off and put them in their locker.

If the students don't do that job they might be in a big problem. in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students.

Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids.

If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures.

In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time.

During class time students might listen to their favorite songs on their phone and don't pay attention to the teacher which they will get a worst citizenship in their report card and they will not graduate and they will feel sad and shocked about what they have done to hurt them.

If a student breaks the rule and gets caught with a cell phone then minis well pick policy 2 which Is; Students are not allowed to bring cell phones at all what so ever. Students can try if you give them a chance to try. students need their cell everywhere they go because anything can happen such as; there could be a fire in the school, or anything else that is tragic.

"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I think that making students who want to participate in sports or activities maintain a B average is wrong. There are various reasons why I think this. One reason is because if 35 percent of the students are used to maintaining a C average or maybe even as low as D average then it wouldn't be fair to them for you to make them have to suddenly have to start maintaining a B average. Another reason is because students may not understand the material that is being taught to them in one quarter of the year so their grades may go down. It wouldn't be fair for you to kick them off of or out of any sport or activity just because they are falling behind. My third and final reason is because not everyone is academically talented and to punish them for that is wrong. What if the work that they don't understand is causing them terrible stress and the only way for them to let it out is playing a sport, to put that to a screeching halt is pretty harsh don't you think?

The average for students to maintain should be a D because even though it may be a low grade they are still passing. Someone could have brought their D average up to a C average and they may feel very proud of themselves but then they would have to face being kicked off of the team or out of an activity and that could put them down a great deal. Maintaining a B all year long is unrealistic to some students. Teacher may grade in a specific way. What I mean by saying that is teachers may knock two points off of your average every time you miss a homework assignment or maybe even more. That would mean for students who miss over five homework assignments a quarter are knocked ten points off of their average.

What if, in one quarter, a student is quickly lagging behind and to catch up would be very close to impossible. Would they still have to be kicked of the activity they are taking part in? The material the teacher is teaching at the moment could be something the student just completely doesn't understand, are you going to make them suffer because of that? A student could be trying their absolute hardest to maintain a B average but they still are a couple points away from their goal, is that a reason to punish them? As a principal, these are some of the things you have to think about.

Not all students are academically talented. They may not be good at turning in assignments on time, passing tests, or completing class work. This could very much so affect their grade in their classes. Are you going to put them out of their activity because of it? This policy is bound to have a lot of angry students and many displeased parents. The school board might have to get involved and that causes a lot of extra stress among staff members.

Stopping students from participating in their activity because they are not maintaining a B average isn't the right thing to do. I think that the facts stated in this letter says so. Please rethink the policy and come up with a new plan.

"Dear Principle,

I do believe all students should be required to do community service. It keeps the community clean and looking better. I don't think however that they should have to do it every day I think it should be twice or maybe three times a week. Because as kids we have lives outside of school so we really don't want to pick up trash every day. I remember one time when I was in fifth grade we had to go outside and pick up the playground because people were making a mess of it. It wasn't really torture but I wasn't bothered by it I mean it was actually kind of enjoyable. If the principle allowed them to do community service during school hours it might not be as big of a conflict. But if you make them come in after school to do community service it might result in a problem. Because there are other things that we would like to do, for example we would rather spend time with our friends or family. I just feel like if you're going to make kids do something at least reason with them a little.

sincerely,

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. When someone gets another person's advice they are thankful, but they usually aren't satisfied with just one person's advice. People often want every ones full advice so that they can see how many people like one thing compared to another. This may only be what I do, but I do this to see how many people like one thing compared to another. Lets find out why other people like to get every ones opinion.

Almost everyday my mom asks my dad, brother, and I which pair of shoes or which clothes we like better. After that she takes a majority vote to see how many of us chose an item compared to another. Then she wears the item that got more people's opinion on. I think almost everybody does this when they cannot decide on one thing or another. Its also good to ask for more than one persons opinion and here is why.

Asking for more than one persons opinion can be helpful not by just comparing things but also by working on social skills. Asking for advice works on your social skills because when you're talking to people you are becoming more social and usually, you make friends by talking. Making friends is a big part in becoming more social, therefore, asking for advice helps you make new friends and become more social. So asking for multiple people's advice probably making more friends as well. Sometimes, if you are feeling down, you just need to ask for advice and you will feel better.

Friends can help you make better choices as well by giving advice. I always ask my friends for advice because I want to know every ones opinion. So sometimes just asking your family for advice is not enough, so that is why you ask your friends. Also getting more peoples opinions on things lets you see what the majority of people like, so if you ever want to get them anything for their birthday or other activities you know what to get them. Asking for advice is beneficial for almost everything we do, in my opinion.

In conclusion asking for advice is really beneficial. It helps make friends and better choices along the road. I also think that people ask for advice everyday which is why most of the time people make good choices. overall asking for advice helps people make the best of choices for many things. Nevertheless, keep asking for advice, for it is very beneficial to everyone.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear state senator,

I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college because, it requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal,its actually a good thing. Basically all voters are involved because if it wasnt for that one voter the president wouldnt had been elected as president. A candidate with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. if we didnt have voters we might would have the worst president of them all, he could do bad things for the country he want, which may affect us as a country. Dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College votye is possible is because, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Another reason, is that the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitutuion .Large states such as florida , wyoming, gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small states does. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote . yet that has happened very rarely. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that is rarely betrayed.

in addition, We can have argue that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off the potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for their state . They have to be more careful about who they want to vote because, it can cause alot of damge to the president or even the world that we live in. They should let people who already know about the political party's and the democrats and the republicans.

to be continued, We should have our background checked on if we should vote or not because , people have faked thier identity and voted , or even forced someone else to vote for them even if they didnt want to. the electoral college is a very important process that goes on in this world just to make our place a better one . If our electoral college do better we can have more oppertunities in life, like when the good president becomes president just like obama , He can do good things with the taxes or even make it easier for kids to have jobs so they wont have to be on the streets doing bad things and maybe even one day they would grow up to be able to vote for thier favoritem president.

And that is why I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear State Senator,

Currently, the Electoral College makes the final decision of who should be elected president. Some people may think otherwise, but I believe that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. In the Electoral College they don't vote for the president. It's also unfair to voters, and it's the disaster factor.

To begin with, I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America because the Electoral College doesn't even vote for the president. As the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer states.. Instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.

Moving on, I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America because the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media marketse didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

Last but not least, I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America because the Electoral College is a disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those el    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author introduced a new technology. It is called the Facial Action Coding System. It enables computers to identify human emotions. Those emotions can be portrayed on a human or on a painting scuh as, The Mona Lisa. This new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is valuable. It is valuable because it can figure out exactly what someone was feeling and it could help schools.

Now, figuring out exactly what someone was or is feeling may not be so important to you. It could be very important though. For example, in the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", paragraph 1, the author tells us exactly how Mona Lisa was feeling. She was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. For the moste part she was happy right? But what about the 17% of her feelings that were filled with disgust, fear, and anger. Whatwas causing those feelings. Think about it. If we can figure out exact emotions of people from the past, we could dig in and find out a lot more about our world's history. Those 17% of emotions could be nothing at all, but what if it was a major. What if it was something we didn't know about her.

This new technology could also help out schools. In aragraph 6, the author talks about how the Facial Action Coding System could potentially improve classrooms. That would result in smarter people in this world which is great. The technology could read your facial expressions to see if you are bored. If you are bored, then the technology could improve the classroom to be more interesting to you. If you are more interested in the subject at hand, then you will understand it better. If you understand it better, you will have better grades and have more knowledge. This will ultimately result in smarter people in the world.

So the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It can help us find exact emotions of a person. It could help us with with our schooling. We could find out so much more about our world and increase the IQs of others. This system could be so important for our world. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Phones and Driving

Our society's reliance on technology has increased significantly in the past few decades.

Mobile phones were once brick-like impractical devices. Since then, they have evolved into sleek mini computers. Now that phones are more portable, people tend to take their cell with them everywhere, including on the road. With the heavy reliance our society has created around these devices, it is, understandably, difficult to resist using them. For this very reason, cell phones pose a great risk to driver's. The distraction imposed by smartphones can be just as harmful as driving under the influence. Using cell phones at all while driving should absolutely not be allowed. Any amount of attention diverted from the road is incredibly dangerous.

Some of the most fatal accidents have occured, not because of intoxication, but as a result of texting and driving. In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use (The Zebra). That is 4,637 lives that could have been spared if it weren't for the recklessness of irresponsible drivers. In 2002, 62% of people owned regular cell phones, while today, in 2019, about 95% of americans own cell phones. 77% of these modern cell phones owners have smartphones, which can be even more distracting (Pew Research Center). In that time, car accidents caused by cell phone distraction has increased from 6% to 25% of all car accidents (Schlossberg 2002, Miller & Zois 2019). There is a clear correlation between the increased reliance of cell phones and distracted driving accidents. The irresponsible actions of these drivers is causing increased danger on our roads. Leniency cannot be accepted. The law should have absolutely no tolerance for this hazardous driving.

Even the best drivers may be involved in a potentially life-threatening crash while trying to use their phone and drive. According to an NPR article on multitasking, when you are ""Switching from task to task, you think you're actually paying attention to everything around you at the same time. But you're actually not. You're not paying attention to one or two things simultaneously, but switching between them very rapidly"" (Hamilton). The article later goes on to state, ""You cannot focus on one while doing the other. That's because of what's called interference between the two tasks."" Based off of this information, it can be inferred the concept of interference is also applicable to using a smartphone while driving. If a driver is busy paying attention to their screen, there is no way they could also be paying close attention to the road.

Even five seconds of being distracted by a cell phone can be enough time for someone to get into an accident. One personal injury lawyer states, ""A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field"" (Miller & Zois). A range this large in a such a short time span conveys how much potential there is for injury when behaving so carelessly. Anyone who may claim it is safe for them to go on their phone while operating a vehicle because they are a master at multitasking is simply overconfident in their abilities. The truth is, it would be impossible for anyone to drive safely while distracted.

With lives at risk, texting and driving should be out of the question. Not only would such negligence put one's own physical well being at risk, but all those around them as well.

Thousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down.

"The author really makes you feel as if exploring Venus could be safer than taking a trip to the movies. Obviously he points out also that it isn't safe, it's a huge risk that humans would have to take just to achieve knowledge about another planet.

The author first explains what Venus is, to prepare readers to further listen on what we would see on Venus. The author says Venus is ""Earth's twin,"" and further supports this with ""it may have well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" ""It,"" reffering to Venus. The author states Venus has ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" Telling the readers this information makes it seem as if seeing Venus would feel comfortable to us and nothing too out of the ordinary.

As ordinary as the author tries to make a trip to Venus seem he doesn't end up leading us in the wrong direction, as he also states the dangers, ""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Reading that information makes it seem doubtful humans could ever explore Earth's neighbor.

The author goes on to suggest ideas that NASA has pulling the reader back in to believe that it could be promising to think that one day humans can explore Venus. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" That's a lot to take in but the author makes it easy for us to understand the idea by comparing it to ""Jet airplanes traveling higher to fly over many storms.""

The author wraps it up by saying ""Venus has value."" He doesn't go deep into the what ""value's"" exploring Venus could have. Only thing he stats is ""insight,"" and ""human curiosity."" The author not going deep into the values is exceptional because that's not what the article was about. The article is more about just progress in space exploration, focusing on Venus. The author then wraps it up with a fair conclusion, including his main point that, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",0,persuade_corpus,0
"You are sitting in your chair. The plastic hurts your legs and back as it curves in an uncomfortable position, ill-adapted to your person. The intolerable buzz of the air conditioning that does nothing to cool the over-heated room drones at your ears, making it impossible to focus. The dull, artificial bulbs that in no way compensate for natural sunlight burn away at your eyes, giving you headache after headache. The other kids are yelling and blasting music, talking instead of doing the work you have been told to complete in an unreasonable, almost impossible time. The work you are doing makes no sense to you and you feel incompetent as those around you breeze by effortlessly. You need to ask the teacher about your work but shes busy grading papers, paying no attention to the class you have been forced into. You can not focus on a single word of your assignment, and even if you could understand it, you would not be able to complete it, because that same day youve already had three tests and two quizzes and all you want is to go home and take a short nap to recharge your brain. You long for some solution to your endless problems in the classroom, and you realize there is another way. Learning from home can solve all these problems and more. With the ability to work online, you not only have the comfort of being at home, but also have more flexibility in your schedule, can learn at your own pace, and can eliminate almost any distractions.

First and foremost, being able to work in a comfortable environment is crucial to focusing and being able to produce the best work possible. While at school, students are being crammed into small classrooms with masses of other students, leaving each individual cramped. With only a square foot of desk space to write on, and the inability to move freely due to the molecule ratio of classroom size to students present, students are unable to concentrate on a given task. Scientists have proven through various studies that being comfortable while working has a direct effect on ones ability to produce quality work. By giving students the opportunity to work away from school, the comforts of home will aid in excelling the learning process. Students are also fed ill-nutritious foods in unnaturally short lunch periods, causing masses of students to consume foods that decrease brain power. When students are given less then 15 minutes to stuff their faces with greasy carbs before being shoved back into their classrooms, the students ability to work is compromised in ways like never before. By allowing students to work at home, they also have access to more nutritious food with reasonable eating periods.

In addition to comfort, working with a more flexible schedule also benefits students. In high school, students are often faced with the dilemma of an overwhelming amount of tests, quizzes, or projects due on a single day. Working online with a more flexible schedule, allows a student to space out assignments as needed, improving the quality and ability to learn from each one. In addition to this, the student can also plan their learning around their personal life, and allows the student to create a schedule that does not force them to chose between an important test and seeing family that visits only once a year. The ability to have more flexibility is also scientifically proven to improve learning in scenarios at school where students are forced to sit for hours at a time. Scientists have shown that teens can only focus for hour long intervals with 30 minute breaks in between. At school, classes are, on average, one and a half hours with only seven minute breaks in between. This shows how much an online approach to schooling can greatly benefit students.

Not only can online learning provide much needed flexibility, but it also allows students to learn at their own pace. Some students are faster in some subjects then others, and even within subjects, students may struggle with different learning objectives. The freedom of learning online allows students to work at a pace that is comfortable for them. This by itself eliminates assignments such as ""busy work"" given to students that fully understand the material faster then others. This also allows students to fully understand the material before moving on, instead of rushing to keep up with a class that is moving to fast to allow a struggling student to keep up. Some students are very intelligent and work well in higher level classes, but simply need slightly more time to practice and understand concepts then others, which is a matter that online classes solve completely.

Finally, online schooling allows for the removal of distractions that are commonly found in the classroom. At every school, there is always a group of individuals that have no interest in being at school, and focus all of their efforts into disrupting the class. At home, you can not only rid yourself of these students who curse loudly, blast music throughout the halls and classrooms, and often start fights in the middle of class, but also other distractions such as the droning artificial lights and loud air conditioning. Schools have small budgets for large amounts of students and this causes the school to make financial choices that sacrifice quality school equipment, such as quieter air-conditioning and plumbing that doesnt shake the walls of surrounding classrooms every time someone needs to relieve themselves.

While some may say that giving a student these freedoms leaves them at greater risk for slacking off completely, they dont take into consideration that once these downfalls of the school system have been fixed by online schooling, students can see and enjoy firsthand what learning the the right environment can be like. Students will want to learn. Students will want to experience the joy of knowledge. Online schooling prevents all of the downfalls of the school system while highlighting the positive aspects, allowing students to greatly benefit.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Although student-designed projects isn't a horrible idea, because students would pay attention more to the assignment since their putting effort of their own into it. But at the same time student-designed project can effect them learning more,because all the assignments will be the same. It could still be a big distraction for the students.

The reason why i believe it can be bad for their learning enviorment. Since all the work will be the same the students can look things up online. Getting all the answers from the internet and being able to just cheat off friends. Students copying from friends causes students to learn less. Causes them not being envolved in the assignment. The students would be able to pick their own type of questions in the project. Those questions can be really easy for them and picj it for the less work.

For example since the students will be not learning very much during the summer. They will not be ready for the beggining of the school year. Students will find the school work difficult for them since all they did during the summer was choose easy assignments for th project and cheat off of each other. Putting in type of effort to the student-designed project.

Teacher-designed projects will be outstanding for the students. It would so get the students for envoled. The teacher can possibly let the students have partners and it'll be more exciting for them. The teacher-designed project will have work thats equal to your grade. Not make it too easy but also not too hard. Each student or group would have different kind of project so students can have their own work.

Yes student-designed projects would be cooler for the students to have their own project and not be assigned one. It can also help them learn more as much as not help them learn more because students who actually do their own work and choose good questions for the project can help them be successful. But there is just too many students who would cheat and not give effort to the project. In conclusion i think teacher-designed projects for the summer is far more successful for the students than letting them do their own designs, because of the lack of effort is going to be put in if they do student-designed project and the amount of similar project they'll be from cheating off of each other.                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,2

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size. It is often referred to as Earth's twin because of this. However, their are some dangers to eploring the planet more in depth.

The author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" The author put this piece of information in to show that we should do more research to show that life once exsisted on Venus.

The author put this piece of infomation in to prove that NASA is trying to come up with possible solutions to explore Venus. However, they arent working out so well as a vehicle like this would prevent them from collecting any rocks or gases to bring back and research.

The vehicle NASA is planning will not allow researchers to take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else or that matter. The author states, ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmoshpere, renddering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

"You make choices everyday, and there is a lot that goes into it. Everybody always wants to do the popular thing, so they get multiple opinions. Multiple viewpoints, advice and the aftermath are all things that people take into account before making a choice.

Many people often seek multiple viewpoints. Lots of people ask their family for opinions. Lets say I'm at Target with my mom and I see a pair of boots I think are really pretty, I'm going to ask my mom if I should get them or not before I spend money on them. Friends, just like family are credible resources. If they are a good friend, they will tell you the honest truth no matter what. Many people want multiple viewpoints. Even if it's just buying a pair of boots from Target, one wants to make sure they are pleasing everyone. Everybody has a different opinion and they should all be respected even if you don't agree with it.

No two opinions are the same. Nobody wants to do the unpopular thing. From my experience all anyone wants to be is popular. Lots of people have different advice. You might ask Generic_Name if she likes your shoes and she says yes because they are unique and then you ask Generic_Name and she says no because they are to plain. Everyone has a different opinion and thats okay, they are entitled to it. However, that can make it harder when trying to make a decision. Nobody's thought process is the same as the person sitting next to them.

The after math of a choice is also important. Social media has a huge role in decision making. For example, if Taylor Swift is wearing a watch everyone is going to decide to go out and buy that cool watch. Everybody wants to maintain a good reputation. Not a lot of people, at least a far as I know, want to be known as the ""weirdo"". Just as many people that want a good reputation want attention. There is good and bad attention. It's all about finding the balance of the both of them. There is a lot that goes into a choice.

Multiple opinions are nessesary to make a good decision. More then one viewpoint can be crucial to making a good choice, no two people have the same opinion and that after math is also important are all things to keep in mind when inquiring advice.

"why should i take your advice when you won't take mine. When people ask for advice some time's it better, they ask more than one person as suppose to one person. my question is why is it better to have more than one advice from other as suppose to one person. My first advice is asking advice from people isn't bad because you can ask the people close to you they. second you can whether or not you want there help because it's your choice. My last advice is that you can ask as many people as you want. when asking for an advice make sure you get both side of the argument,

When asking for an advice from people you want to ask you'r self know it's not bad but as long as you ,can you trust them or not. Be careful making that decision because some people could be jelouse of you. They might have wanted to have the same role in the play that you got. Your stuck on whether to join the play or stay with you family and help them out. they might take advantage of you'r distress ,and offer you advice that could stress you out more. They might say that if you go join the play how will your family feel. How would it feel of they left you think about that .they could also say how will they get by if your not around what will you do ,and start to make you have negative thoughts about your self ,and more they would have put more pressure on they decision your about to make . But as to when you ask some one you trust ,and you know that even if they wanted the same role as you they would give you they best advice. They could tell you that if you go you can make more money and help out more as to if you were here they would spend more money on you because they town doesn't have high paying jobs. they might tell you not to go and say that if you went and didn't make it big and came back home will you be able to help them ,or what if you went to a dangerous place and you got harmed your family would be in more dept because ,they will have to pay for your hospital bills. with there advice you could be able to make you'r decision

My second advice is whether you want there help or not. The reason why am saying this is because if you want there help but you think you can make the decision your self when it can impact you. What i am about to tell you is from my experience, when i was picking my courses for middle school course I was debating whether I should ask my family for help. I decided not to and it cost me because when i was picking my classes i picked all A.A.P's thinking I knew what I could do . on the first day of class the teacher gave us a quiz on pythageron theorem ,and I thought that it was easy ,but i kept answering trying to solve the question i couldn't solve it I was freaked I didn't know what to do so i guessed and turned it in. When I got the test back i got 75% instead of dropping out the class, I kept on staying in the class after a while of failing my family told me to drop out ,but i didn't and i failed the class.

My third advice is ask as many people as you want, as my grand farther used to say ask as may people you need to ask before it final. what am trying to say is that is you are unsure of your self or other's you can ask as many people as you need and figure out what you want to do. When i was in 5th grade, and wanted advice i would ask five people, but i was all ways unsure. So i would ask more people for their views ,and idea's because i asked them i was more sure of what i wanted to do. So what ever you do maybe ask for help many people have different views just make sure when you ask people you know you asked as many people as you want when asking for an advice make sure you get both side of the argument, because just cause you like on side because you have all of your favorite people on it doesn't mean you have to look there way. when asking people for their advice you have to make sure you can reason with them ,and the and see things from their prospective. always look both ways because you can always miss some thing because when i was a 3 grade I would always let my ball roll down hill in our back yard.

one day it rolled onto the road i ran to get it ,and if I hadn't looked left and right I would have die because a car was coming a top speed.

in conclusion what am trying to say is by this is when asking for advice you should talk to more than one person,after all 2 heads are better than one because al am saying is asking advice from people isn't bad because you can ask the people close to you they. you can chose whether or not you want there help because it's your choice. And third is that you can ask as many people as you want. and last you can always have more than one view because you never know when you might need to take this advice to hearth ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

Wouldn't you like to keep the community at its beauty? Community service is really good for the community and our self-being, but not all of us have the time and will to help out. That's why i don't think that community service is required for all students. I will tell you why I think this is so, and i urge you to keep reading.

There are many things you can do for community service. like cleaning up your city, park, beach, or any public place that you live near. You wouldn't want your home to be messy and unmanageable, right? So why shouldn't you keep your surroundings magnificent, helping keep your city beautiful is something everyone should want to do. Helping out children in need academically is another form of community service. Children should be well educated for a better future, and maybe help your community when he or she possibly becomes successful in their later years.

But sometimes people don't have the time to help out. That person could live a really busy life. your job or getting done what need to be done should be something more important than helping other people. Or maybe they're the ones who need the help with their academics. Sometimes people just want to relax and take it easy for a while.

community service is a good thing for yourself and the community, but you should take other people's needs into consideration. That's why its shouldn't be required for students to perform community service.

"I believe that the Face was a natural landform. Now in this esaay im going to state 2 reasons why I believe that it's a natural landform.

The first reason I believe this is because in papragraph 7 it says"" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitin when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing....a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This part of the prompt tells that alot of people wanted to know what the faces were and they found out that the faces were natural landforms. This sentence also shows that they went out and found that it was a natural landform. That is just one of the reasons why i believe that the faces are natural landforms.

The last reason I believe that they are natural landforms is in the 11th paragraph it says"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern thigs in a digital image 3 times bigger tht the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they are!"" This paragraph tells how there was no way that with that camera they couldn't miss the fact that it was a natural landform. So, if there were alien prints they could see them with that camera though the lences.

Those are just some of the reasons why o believe that the faces are natural landforms. ",0,persuade_corpus,0

Should the Electoral College be kept in favor? The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections. Well on the other hand, Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole agreed to abolish the elctoral college and change to election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.It is unfair to the voters because the electors elect the president. Also, not only are the voters voting for electors,they are voting for the canidate's electors when they think they're voting for the canidate. Choosing a president should be elected by the popular vote of people not electors.

To start with,the president of the United States should be elected by the popular vote of the people. The president is there to guide and lead the people. The citizens of the U.S should have the right to vote for who they think should be president. For instance,some residents have a feeling that their votes don't count.

To add,it is unfair to the voters because the elctors elect the the president. Eventhough the electors represent your state,they don't let the people choos who they desire for president. When voting for president, it shouldn't be all about the electors. The Electoral College even has the possibility of turning voters away that voted for a canidate that has no hope for supporting their state.

Further more,the electoral college does avoid problems. Meaning,a canidate cannot receives a certain amount of the votes cast. For instance, when a canidate has more votes than other canidates while not receiving a clear majority oof votes. Also in big states ""the Electoral College rebuild some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senat decreed in the constitution.""[Richard Posner {21}]    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Online classes could be a very advantageous opportunity for students. They provide countless benefits and would be extremely beneficial for students because, students would be in a conformable environment, they would be able to further their learning, and they would also be catering to student unable to attend normal class. These are just some of the benefits online classes provide.

If students had the opportunity to attend online classes they be more productive than in a classroom due to their environment. Working from home can be a much needed break for student providing an escape from the stress and anxiety of school. It allows student to escape the social hierarchy of modern high schools, and be more conformable in class not having to worry about what others think of them. For instance, one day a student named Generic_Name is running late for school; he has no time to shower, fix his hair, or even brush his teeth. Now he has to go to school and worry that people are going to make fun of his hair, or worry about his bad breathe. That day would fill him with anxiety and stress. although if Generic_Name had an online class that day he wouldn't have to worry about all that, no one would know that his breath smelled, or that his hair was all messed up. online class provide a much need escape from the classroom setting for students.

Online classes also give student the option to take more courses or courses they school doesn't offer. In Generic_City Student are given the opportunity to take one to two more online classes in addition to there seven in school classes. These additional classes allows students to graduate early, and pursue further education and a career much earlier in life. Which positively benefits society by providing a way for young adults to play an acting part in supporting society. Student who've taken advantage of online classes have also had the opportunity to take classes not previously provided. These classes could pivotal role in a student choosing whether to seek further education after high school, or decide what they want to study in there secondary education.

Online class would also provide a way for student unable to attend class in school to receive an education. There are some cases where adolescence cant attend school due to health problems or mental illness. There was child nicknamed Bubble Boy because he lived in a bubble. Bubble Boy had no working immune system forcing him to live in a bubble. This is an extreme case where someone wouldn't be able to attend school for their own safety. There has also been cases where schools turn to online classes due to an epidemic. Currently in South Korea all D.O.D. school have been closed due to the spread of the corona virus. making online classes a vary viable option to continue class in those circumstances.

These are just a few of the many reasons online classes are beneficial to students. Online classes are excellent opportunities for students because, students would be in a conformable environment, they would be able to further their learning, and they would also be catering to student unable to attend normal class. These are just some of the many benefits of online classes. Who's wouldnt take advantage of this amazing opportunity.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal:

I believe you should go with Policy 2. When students bring cell phones to school they use them during down time in class. They text while teachers are talking. This can disturb the learning environment. Students will be distracted by texts they get and will want to respond. They can also pretend to be doing work and be on their phones. There is no way to enforce the rule of having cell phones to school.

Also, with cell phones in school; rumors spread around faster. This can harm a student's reputation. Cyber bullying can also take place. If the students have the resources around them to do it, they will.

Lastly, i believe no cell phones should be in school because it makes teachers jobs harder. They have to teach and watch for phones. It also makes learning harder for students. They become distracted from learning. It can lower test grades; which can make school funding go down.

Students being distracted, teachers on the lookout, and possibly lower test grades is why no cell phones should be allowed in school.

"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems could be very useful. There are several reasons for this. First of all there are several industries ot can be used in. Secondly it could help students get a better education. The last reason is that it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also drawbacks to using a computer software to read people's emotions.

Several industries would benefit from this software. As the article mentions artists are required to be able to recognize the facial expressions of the people they are painting or drawing. These expressions are critical to conveying the correct emotions, so clearly the art industry could benefit from the use of Facial Action Coding Systems. Another way industy that this software could be used in is politics. The article talks about how the software can recognize the difference between a fake smile and a real smile. This could be useful when analyzing political figures as well as celebrities. A possible downside to this is cost effectiveness. The question of is the cost really worth it whenever there are already people in the world that can do the same thing.

Another useful aspect of the Facial Action Coding System is it's use in schools. In the article Dr. Huang, the co-developer of the system, says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, likean effective human instructor."" This could be the most useful aspect of the software, because not everyone learns in the same way. If your computer could recognize when you were getting bored or confused and then fix the problem it would make learning much easier for a lot of people. It would also allow students to move at their own pace as not everyone works at the same speed. A downside to this software is the loss of jobs for teachers as well as the reliance on technology.

The last aspect is that it could make advertisements more relevant. The article states that if you smile when an internet ad appears on your screen, another similar as might follow. However if you frown, the next ad will be different. This is useful both for the consumer and the company. We all know that when an annoying ad pops up it usually gets ignored especially if we've already seen that ad one hundred times. But what if the ad was for something you actually liked then you might go buy it. The only negative about this is that the software won't recognize if you're smiling about the video you just watched or the ad that pops up.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System could possibly be very useful in the future. There are many industries where it could be used, schools could use it to make education more beneficial and it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also a few issues which should be adressed before it could be used in mainstream businesses and schools. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Over the years the amount of cars that have been manufactured have increased immensly. Cars help us get to place quicker by making less effort to get there. We no longer need to walk to go to the park or the mall which can take a long time. Although cars are very useful and fun to drive, it also has its risk like anything else on Earth. Which is why i think limiting car usage would be a great idea.

Most cars use gasoline or diesel as there fuel to get them going. This causes problems because the fuel that is burned pollutes the atmosphere and creates smog. Paris had this problem before. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer says that Paris had ""days of near-record pollution"" and they attempted to reduce it by applying a 22-euro fine ($31). As a result congestion in Paris was down 60 percent and the smog, as stated in the article, ""cleared enough for the French party to rescind the ban of odd-numbered plates"" Getting rid of the smog and having less air pollution would help not only the environment but i can also help us breathe oxygen easier. Limiting car usage can help us decrease pollution and increase breathable oxygen.

Limiting car usage can benfit us in many ways. It can reduce air pollution which not only helps us breathe better but it also helps the environment. It can also relieve stress. Everyone that drives a car knows how stressful it can be sometimes. Any traffic jam can turn a regular day to a stressful day. Hearing someone honking their horn, yelling ""Come on! Move already!"" and adding some unnecesary profanity can be very irritating. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky says that for the third straight year the city of Bogota have a car-free day called Day Without Cars. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" states the article. A lot of people actually participated in this event even thought it rained that day. The Mayor of Bogota Antanas Mockus said that even though it is raining it ""hasn't stopped people from participating"". It was a great idea to have a day like this to relax and not be stuck in traffic which is one reason why one businessman was happy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. It's a great event that should spread to the world. It will be very helpful to us and the environment.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is very beneficial. It can relieve stress and reduce air pollution. It can also reduce car accidents which can decrease the number of deaths that occur in a car accident. If you're on a budget, limiting the the amount of time you use your car can help you save gas money. It can also help you excercise a little. Since you aren't using a car you have to use a different form of transportation like walking or riding a bike. These are just a few advantages that limiting car usage have. Limit your car usage, it can help you and the environment.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"We should explore venus and three ressons why are that people can not survive the landing, and the air is 97% carbon dioxide, and lastly the enviorment is really hot too hot that people can not be able to live on.

And one resson that we sould start to explore venus is that people can not survive the landing to venus and a quot from the text is ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" and that proves we need to start exploring venus because it shows us our mistakes in our space craft.

I think that it isn't right to change the school policy because some students cant pull there grade up to a B or higher. i think that it should stay the way it is because a C is still a passing grade and its hard to focus on 2 things at once because there is always homework that you have to do or a test that you have to study for and you have to practice for a game that's coming up or you have to go to practice so that means you wont have that much time to finish your homework or study for the next test that's coming up and you cant finish your notebook for the notebook check that's coming up so its hard to focus on 2 things at once. so if you just keep it the way it is then it will be less stressful for the students and they will have less things to worry about. I think that it will be reasonable if you don't let students play sports if they have a F or a D because that isn't a passing grade so they wont have 2 things to worry about at once because they will only be focusing on school only. this is my opinion and i hope other students have the same opinion because it will be easier for most kids in this school thanks for reading this i hope you really think about it.,0,persuade_corpus,3
"Okay hey,  I just wanted to introduce myself before we get into this subject my name is PROPER_NAME and i'm writing about changing the Electoral College to election by popular vote. The reason why I am writing about this is because there are a lot of things wrong with the Electoral College and under that sytem, voters don't vote for presidents they vote for slate of electors who then elect the president and can elect someone completely different than who the voter wanted to be president. So there is a possiblity that your not going to wind up getting what you wanted out of the outcome. Also in electoral vote the most worrying thing is the prospect of a tie. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president on that outcome.) At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to the voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they habe no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode ISland and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.....

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. THe best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

"Dear Principal,

I think that to be able to participate in school sports and other activities you shouldn't have to get a B average. Students not only need to be active to be healthy but it also supports brain function. And if you take that away to some people it could causes them harm.

I do agree with having at least a C average but if you change it to a B then lots of kids wouldn't be able to participate in sports maybe not that they aren't smart but that they made a mistake while doing a math problem or that they forgot to do their homework because their grandmas in the hospital and they were there all weekend and just didn't have time. C is average and there are lots of average people it doesn't mean their not smart it just means they aren't as smart as the brilliant people.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that it is a great idea to require students to perform community service. It gives students great opportunities to help out the community and the people around them. It may take time out of their lives, (not that many middle school students have ""lives"" out of school anyways) but it's something that should be done not only for the community but for themselves. Required community service would defiantly be a good addition to our school.

Not every student has the resources or community ties to do community service. Requiring it would give those students the opportunity and level to do so. I for one wouldn't know where to start doing community service unless it was a class organized event. For example, if you required community service then, as a class, we could come up with ideas so we could all go and do our part to help the community.

Doing community service takes time, yes, but it helps you out in the long run. Not only are you helping the community, but your also putting an advantage on your college applications. For example, say you were the Dean of Admissions at a college, and you had to choose between two students to accept. Which one would you choose, the one with community service, or the one with nothing? It also gives you this feeling of being needed and makes you a better person inside. I have felt unwanted and useless for a good portion of my life, but when I help someone else, it gives me hope and a joyous feeling to where I feel accepted and needed.

You see, community service would do nothing but help us. We as a whole community would benefit. We as a whole school would benefit. We as individuals would benefit. I hope you take increasing meanings as to bringing community service to SCHOOL_NAME. I can't wait!

"Dear,

State Senator

I think that we should keep this electoral college because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

On the other hand it would be way easier for people to vote. Also a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. Plus, each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So this would be perfect for everyone to vote.

After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of theelectors in december of the election year. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election.

Also, most States have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate. however, maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation'.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word 'state' also refers to the district of columbia.

so i really do think that we should keep this it would be a really good thing to keep.

"Extracurricular activities are very important in a students life. They develop communication skills, social skills, and among others, your ability to work well with other people. On the other hand, they should not be required for all students to participate in. Although all students could possibly find something they're interested in when it comes to after school activities, such as clubs or sports, not all students are capable of handling the responsibilities that come along with an extracurricular activity. Have you ever come to the conclusion that not every student can even maintain good grades at school? For some children, it's harder to balance school work and their everyday life alone, but if you add an extracurricular activity to their plate of responsibilities, it may be too much for them to handle. For a principal to make extracurricular activities a necessity at school, is not very considerate. As an adult you must realize that not every person, let alone children, can handle the same work load as others can.

Even though research has shown that extracurricular activities can be very beneficial for people, as it pertains to their physical, and mental well-being, it can also be damaging if too much work is placed upon one person alone. Stress is a very common factor in a child's life, and the majority of it is from life at home, and the excessive amount of work received at school. But in comparison, some kids can handle the load, and like the responsibility given to them. Not all children are like that though, and that is what the principal fails to realize. Although the principal may not have come to light about the amount of stress that could potentially be put on the students, the gesture to make the activities a necessity was most likely at their best interest at heart.

For the kids that work well under pressure, or have the capability to handle the challenges they face, the change in the schools priorities for the students probably won't affect them as much. Although only one extracurricular activity would be required, not all students could be able to wisely manage their time to fit the activity in their schedule. Also, maybe not all students would be able to find something they enjoy with the options given at their school. If someone were to make it a priority for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would be extremely recommended for the person to make the activity choices an exceptionally wide variety, so that it is more likely for students to find the things they enjoy to do. With the exception of making sure that there would be an activity to match each students interest, the idea would not be too bad. But in the same breath, that'd require some type of survey or application of some type, that every student must take in order to find out their interests, so that way making the activities wont be as difficult. Although keep in mind, that not every student may want to participate regardless of whether or not there is an activity they might enjoy.

There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouse some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, ""average"" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand. But the idea as a whole would potentially cause a lot of stress to the principal, considering that not every child will have the same perspective on the idea, nor will their parents.

Yes, the motion being taken will have several benefits, and several stressful altercations, but at the end of the day everyone is different, and not everyone is going to have the same opinion when it comes to this situation. Even though the principal is only asking each student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it still may be too much to ask of some kids, considering their life outside of school, and what they find important in their lives as far as activities go. But maybe enforcing this act could open not only the students' eyes, but the parents as well, that trying new things isn't always such a bad idea, sometimes we just need a little push to get us started. But despite all the possible benefits of the idea, it still probably shouldn't necessarily be a requirement for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know how much stress someone deals with just by handling their personal life, one activity may not seem like much to you, but for some people one activity could be a handful. Forcing the students to participate in activities that they may not like, could possibly lead to a decrease in social skills, instead of an increase.          ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principle,

I feel that you decision to change the sport limit average is a terrible idea.

To back up my thesis i have to decide that its unfair to some children because they may not be as smart as others.

Some may just be doing work when others are doing their best but are still not passing with gold stars.

You also never know if they have a bad home life and need sports to bring them happiness.

But what if they are not smart enough to play.

I also think that a B average is to high of an expectation.

If you to make it a C average it could give the kids a warning that their grades are slipping.

Instead of making the B average an have to.

You encourage the kids maybe saying, "" Hey PROPER_NAME, Nice job on the test!

Maybe next time you could study with me in my office and get a B or maybe an A!

Great Job! Keep up the work.""

Which might not let them play outside which all children need. Also to maintain a B average it would take a lot of work and maybe the kid works on a farm and has no time for homework during the day because he has to work all day after school.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"So in my opinion, I am definantely for the development of driverless cars.

I find they will be useful in the future for these reasons: 1) They will most likely cause less wrecks. 2) The will probably be safer for the community. 3) They might bring new ideas to the table.

I find that these three reasons will bring a positive outlook on driverless cars. I do however have one problem with driverless cars: carelessness, but i will explain my reasoning later.

I think driverless cars will be the future.

So as i said in my first reasoning, they will most likely cause less wrecks.

I say this because if everyone had a driverless car, the the programming in the cars will mostlikely correspond with each other and (in my thinking) they will react to each other as they get close to one another to prevent any damage that comes up.

This leads to my second reason why i think thety should keep working on driverless cars, it ill probably be better for the community.

Like i said, if the cars can correspond and react to each other, thanthey will have a greater chance of not hitting each other and causing less injuries to cars, the driver and passengers, and pedestrians.

This could definantely decrease injuries by cars per year and could possibly save thousands upon thousands of lives.

This is of course a goos thing and if driverless cars could prevent this, then i'm pretty sure anyone would approve and want this car.

Now my second reason for why driverless cars is a good idea and should be promoted is because this might bring new ideas to the table of creativity if you want to call it.

The reason i say this is because if they can create cars that drive on their own without human needs, then this might spark some new ideas for new inventions (doesn't have to all be car related in my opinion).

Like they could be at the verge of creating inventions that people might have never thought of before.

Now i know it does seem like that i'm getting a bit off track about the driverless cars thing, but for a second, just imagine all the possibilities that could come out of driverless cars and their technology.

This could bring about ideas one could only dream about.

This could be a serious change to the world as it is if companies can bring fully driverless cars to the world.

Now for the reason why I think that driverless cars might not be a good idea in the first place: carelessness.

Now what I mean by that is mostly two reasons: 1) problem with the technology.

2) Problem with the person behind the wheel.

About the problem with technology, If the company who makes the car provides a misshap with the technology they used to make the car, then there might be a problam when time passes along while driving the car.

Like there could be a miscommunication with the cars (Assuming that everyone has a driverless car with the same or somewhat similar technology that correspond with each other.), there could be a problem with the way it works if not made the way it should be, and the list could go on forever.

Now to the other negative of this reason, the person who is behind the wheel of the driverless car.

What I mean is that the person who is behind the wheel of the driverless car could cuase a problem with the inside or outside of that car like: Mess around with the controls, damage a part of the car through human or nature contact, shortage of a wire or battery or whatever is in or out of the car, and this list has almost unlimited downsides to it, but hopefully you understand my point.

So as I said, driverless cars in my opinion will become the future if made at all.

There is a certainty at the rate this world is going today because people these days have many ideas to come.

I know that there will be more problems to come, but as the saying goes ""There is always a solution to every problem"", and i think that people or companies that are creating this type of machinery knows that there will be new problems that they will have to overcome.

I hope to see them grow and possibly be on the market for the consumers to purchase and experience real and true driverless cars.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Don't Fear, Ask Your Peers!

Have you ever done something stupid? Well, if you got someone else's opinion before you did it, would you have done it? Seeking others opinion before doing something is helpful because you get many different view points and reduces the chances of risk.

First, everyone has many different experiences,that means we all can have different view points. Having different view points can help you make wise and profound dissensions. People often need help with school assignment. Asking for others view points on a project or homework can help someone do better on it and get a better grade. Another example is sports, getting someone else's opinion can help improve your playing style and skill level. Also, when get more then one view point, you are more likely to do the right thing. For example, if someone is doing something questionable, someone who has done it or seen the consequences of doing it, can attempt to stop them.

Secondly, if you ask for others opinions before you act, you reduce the chances of risk. While yes, risk can sometimes be a good thing, it can also be a bad thing. For example, someone is trying to jump off the roof of their house to impress their friends. If someone doesn't tell them to stop they may hurt themselves or others. Another, less stress educing example is, someone wants to use profanity in their English paper for excitement. If someone tell them to stop, the risk of getting in trouble is greatly decreased or goes away altogether. It it always best to recuse stress.

In conclusion, ask for others opinions. Everyone makes mistakes and its okay but It is extremely helpful to ask for your peers opinion because it can help reduce risk and you can get many different view points.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Do you think students would benefit from being to attend classes from home? .Some people agree, that classes from home is better for students .But, some people disagree, that classes from home would benefit for students .In other words ,this type of problem cause controversial discussion among people ,around the word .Parents need to take a best decision ,because is about their children future .However,classes from home, is a wrong idea, for three reasons :Is expensive , students need social life and affects in student's health.

One reason, why these classes from home is a bad idea, is that classes are expensive .If the students receive classes in home, then the parents need to pay it for private teachers, and buy appropriate tools that the students can use, for receive a appropriate class .This classes are more expensive than classes in schools, and parents can save more money, to future university by their child .For example,students can attend to public schools ,and they don't need to pay anything for receive this classes .Also,the schools have a capacity teacher, and good classes that they can choose .The monetary problems, is one of the factors why classes from home is a bad idea.

Another reason, why classes from home is a bad idea is that students need to have a social life .Classes from home are not benefit in students because they need to make friends and expand their imagination ,but if they receive classes from home, they can not .The majority of student ,that receive classes fro home they don't have human contact ,just with their families ,and teachers .Also ,the students that receive classes from home , they don't know about social issues because ,they just know what happened inside with their homes. In other words ,classes from home are not benefit from students to make a social ,integrity ,and leader student formation life .

Finally ,classes from home is a bad idea because ,affects in student's health .The majority of students doesn't receive classes in school because parents think that they protect their child from virus ,and diseases but this is a wrong idea .For instance ,if the child doesnt have nature, and human contact they don't make a strong defense against virus .This child are more prone to get virus ,and diseases because, they are not prepare to receive contact with the external word .People need to receive vitamin from nature ,virus ,external air ,and UV light to make a strong health .Therefore ,classes from home are not benefit in students health, and these is other reasons why is a bad idea .

In conclusion , students would not benefit from being to attend classes from home .Classes from home is a wrong idea for three reasons : Is expensive , students need social life ,and affects in student's health. However ,Students ,and parents need to evaluate the benefits that schools offered for students .Also, parents need to give a opportunity for their child to tried ,a different way to get education like private ,and public schools and then,they can take the best decision that benefit everyone .    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Smart cars may sound smarter than a human being but how smart are they? Smart cars are suppose to be driverless and use less fuel. In my opionion smart cars should not be developed. A smart car can have a technical difficulty and cause an accident and the fault could be said to be the drivers when it never was. This can bring conflict with the driver and the company of the car which can lead to bad consiquences. The car should not be developed becuase it can have techincal difficulties, have a high cost, they take away the fun of driving and learning.

Smart cars should not be deveploed becuase it can fail on something and have techincal difficutlies. The car may not sense something around its surroundings and won't be able to alert the driver on time causing an accident. It can also have failing on the GPS and go a wrong way. The worst casesenerio would be the steering wheel locking and the driver would not be able to control the car if something was to happen. Smart cars may seem smart and safe but technology doesn't always work how it is suppose too.

Another reason why smart cars would not be a good developement would be the cost of the car. The car may be very high at price and wouldnt sell. It could also get a huge donation to get the car started but that money could be a waste by not having a successful project. The car could need something new and it could turn out to be very expensive and won't get fixed being left alone. The car may also need a special street to give it eletrical signal which would be expensive to remake new streets. Smart cars may just be a waste of money.

Another reason for not developing smart cars is we loose the fun in driving and learning. As a teen, people get excited because they get a new oppurtunity to learn and practice something new. We learn the basics of driving and learn from it. We get more freedom to do things and to go to places. But having a smart car can take that away. A teen won't learn from a mistake they do by not driving and correcting themselves. All a person would do is sit there and wait if anything happens. But a teen can have no knowledge in driving and won't know what to do. And as teens we can easily get distracted and cause an accident if we don't pay attention.

In conclusion, smart cars shouldn not be deveoloped. A smart car may sound smart and safe but when it comes to the real world technology can mess up and cause accidents. A human being should always have control of its own thibgs that being their life or their car. A smart car's technology can mess up, be very hight at price, and it can take away the fun of driving and learning. Smart cars should not control our driving, we ourselfs should.

"Fellow Citizens, there are many reasons why limiting car usgage has outstanding oppritunities and advantages.

For an example, If there aren't people out there spending their hard earned money that they worked for, for an expensive car that they are just going to use to get to someplace faster when they could just stop being lazy for once and walk or run, ride bikes, hike, or take a bus, instead of spending money after money to fill a car up to just waste gas, and to fill it up again. Running, riding bikes, hiking, etc. gives you a chance to experience reality. Being outside gives people a chance to see the earths real beauty, and to smell the fresh air. Limiting car usage helps people stay in shape and keeps them healthy if their not just sitting in a car for half a hour when they could be running or walking.

Residents in Vauban, Germany are permitted car ownership, but there are only two places to park : large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. About 70 percent of Vauban's families do not iwn cars, an about 57 percent sold a car to move there. Having a car makes peoples tense, and being in a place where there isnt alot of car usgae makes people much happier. People who live in places where cars arent used as oftn as other states, those towns place stores in walking distance, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

An amazing advantage that people can can from limiting the usage of cars is less drunk drivers, or even none. If there's less drunk drivers, there's less car crashes and less deaths. Everyone understands that you have to be 21 or older in most states to drink alcoholic beverages. The big adavntage out of this is, if older people were to get drunk, they would be forced to call a cab, or even walk home. Their not putting noone else's life in danger, and this would lower the crashes and death fatalities per year.

As as many cars that there is in the world, all the use of them would probably pollute the world. Paris enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of the near-record pollution.

Limiting car usage gives you the oppritunity to be with your family and friends and spend more time with them then you normally would having a car. You can walk and talk with them on the way to work, you can stop by the park and have some fun on your way to the grocery store. The best part about this is, you dont have to worry about the roads being busy. You ca walk, run, hike, and bike without having to hear the noisy streets, the honking, the screeching, etc.

What's the point in having a car that your just going to be wasting money on, when running, walking or riding a bike is free and even cheaper and safer than driving a car. What are you gonna do when your car breaks down? Are you gonna keep spending your money on when it keeps breaking? Why do that when you have two perfectly good and healthy legs and you can run or walk somewhere?

Just take a moment to think about the fines every single person breathing in the world has received? Alot of money wasted on something idiotic huh? just imagine if every state, continents, islands, and places we dont know about all stopped using cars, or even just limited the car usage. We'd be saving a whole ton of money, we'd basically all be middle classes.

This whole situation is a win-win, You get to be with your family 24/7, Running, walking, biking, hiking etc. is all an amazing way to keep people healthy. People dont have to worry about drunk drivers, or car crashes, or car fatalities. People can finally stop spending their hard earned money that they're just going keep spending and wasting on gasoline or to fix your car when its having problems and it breaks. Families can save the money that they would normally be spending on gasoline and start saving for a trip to take their family on to spend more time with them, or to take a trip for yourself.

There are plently more reasons and outstanding advantages that limiting car usage gives you, but these are some of the very best! Just remember, The only good advantages a car can give you is getting you somewhere faster, and keeping you comfortable and safe. But they are also the most danagerous, and expensive things out there. They can take your life or someone elses in an instant, and they can put you in debt quicker than you know! Limitng car usage is for you!    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Imagine that you are a student, everyday you come home, do your homework, and think about how lousy your day has been, boring right? Well, having extracurricular activities after school can help with that. Extracurricular activities can help a student make friends, have fun, and put students in a positive attitude. Some students do not have many friends because they do not interact with people outside of school. When doing extracurricular activities, you are surrounded by people that like doing the same things as you. For example, I am a student that has made many friends from doing dance. Everyday, after school, I go to my dance classes and feel loved because I am surrounded by people just like me.

Having extracurricular activities after school can also put students in a better mood. People tend to be much happier when they are surrounded by people they love and are doing what they love. Even on very difficult days, doing extracurricular activities can make your day much brighter! I take dance after school everyday and no matter how difficult my day has been, dancing with my friends always puts me in a better mood.

While I think that having extracurricular activities after school is a great idea, some might think that it could take too much time and iterefere with homework time. Well, usually, students take a long time to do their homework because they do not want to. They want to have fun! Everyone wants to have fun, nobody wants to be stuck at a desk doing homework. Extracurricular activities are fun and do not take up a massive amount of time. Students will still have time to do their homework after having some fun doing what they love. Some people might say that some extracurricular activities, like sports, can cause injuries. Although you might get hurt, it does not happen very often. Not all extracurricular activities give the oppritunities to get hurt, but they all give the oppritunity to have fun!

Extracurricular activities after school can be very beneficial to ones life by making them live a happier life. You can also make many friends that have the same interests like you. Activities after school can allow you to have fun. Extracurricular activities can really change someones life for the better.        ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"People might want to believe that the Face is created by aliens but it is not, it is a natural landform. The Face is just a natural landform because it is just the shadows that make it look like a face, the landform is also common around the American West, and it is a mesa.

The shadows are the ones that make the Face on Mars look like a face. In the third paragraph in the article it stated ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The reason there is alot of commotion about this is that ""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" He was right because it did.

The Face is also just a landform because there are landforms located in the American West that are also mesa's like the Face. In the last paragraph it said ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Therefore, people are just altering the true facts to make a story of it. The reason many did not believe it was a Matian mesa is because ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

The Face is just a mesa because it said in the text various times that it was just a mesa. In the very beginning it said ""New high- resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" It also said in the last paragraph "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" That shows that the Face is just a natural landform like any other.

Others say that aliens live there and created the Face. In the eight paragraph it said ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Although that might be true in the eleventh paragraph it said ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

Finally, there might be different speculations on wether or not the Face is a natural lanform or not. At this point according to scientist we know that it is a natural formation because it looks like a face because of the shadows, its common like in the American West, and it is a mesa.

"Schools are known to be one of the struggles that all student go through. Because many students struggle with school, online classes and studying from home became an option. However, attending classes in school is more beneficial than taking classes at home, because students focus more in classes at school than at home, and because school is a place where students meet new people and make friendships.

Although some might argue that schools make students stressed, however, schools provide entertaining trips for students, as mentioned before, schools is a place where students make friendships. A

trip with friends helps to overcome stress. Not to add, schools also offer lots of programs and counseling to help out stressed students to overcome their stress.

Taking classes at school helps students be more focused on the lesson that is being discussed in class. For example, when taking classes at home student will have the freedom to do other things while the lesson is being explained, such as using cell phones or talking to people in the same room. This leads to; students not having the full attention and focus on the lesson. This makes students not fully understanding of the lesson and causing them to get bad grades. Since all the attention will be on the lesson at classes in school, students will be focused and will have better grades. Additionally, taking classes at school also gives students the opportunity to ask questions in case of not understanding something, which online classes don't always provide for students.

School is the place where students make friendships and have fun. For instance, when taking classes at home, students will miss the chance to go school dances and make memories. Also, schools help with meeting new people, learning whats wrong and whats right by going through some trouble. This helps students figure out who they are, and who they want to be. When taking classes at home, it will lower the chance for students to meet new people and to figure out who they want to be. That is why classes at school are more helpful.

As can be seen, taking classes at school is more efficient way, than taking classes at home. Even though schools might be stressful, it helps student be more focus on lessons being explained which leads to better grades. And it also helps students to make friendships, have fun, and have memories. That is why taking classes at school should be more supported.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"We are all human beings. We all have some different opinions and some same opinions. The interesting debate was about the Face on Mars. I am here to tell you that the Face is just a natural landform.

I have reasons to why the Face is just a natural landform. First, aliens are not scientificly proven to be real. Therefore, the Face could not have been an alien artifact. Second, the face appear that a person is inside the moon trying to come out and that is impossible for someone to be inside the moon. Finally, no one could have been to Mars and created that Face because it would be stated on the Internet on who created it.

There are numberous of evidence of why the Face is just a natural landform. First, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos revealing it as a natural landoform. In addition, the camera that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo of using the camer's absolute maximum resolution. Futhermore, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compare to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Finally, the picture that Malin's team capture showed that it is Martina's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

Others say that the Face on Mars was not a Martian's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms. Some people believed that it was from an alien artiface. Others like conspiracy theorists said the evidence that NASA would rather hide.

There are reason why the Face on Mars was just a natural landform. This eassy helps you to rethink your thoughts of what it really is. There are logoical supports and evidence. The Mars is an interesting place for a planet.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal:

Community Service is very important, it's important because how will we live in this community if we don't keep it clean. I think that students should have to do community service. We as kids should learn more about service, so when the future comes we will know, how and what to do to keep our community clean. Also, students should do this because, we do make most of the mess that, we should just clean it up. But, if students do not want to do service then we should not make such a big mess, we should just clean up after ourselves. Doing community service could also hep us students in a way. In High School doing community service gives you a ""leg up"" for college. Well you get an extra stamp on your diploma and colleges look for things like that.

"Have you ever wondered what your life would be like if you did not have to drive as much. Maybe you didn't have a car at all. A small experimental suburb in Germany is tooling with the idea of a no car life style, along with many cities in the United States where a car is not a neccesity. Paris however has banned car usage all together, becuase of the amount of smog produced becuase of the automobiles. This could marke the end of car culture across many countries, exspecially the United States. There are many advantages to not owning or using a car, some of them may just cause you to get ride of your car.

A small suburb in Germany on the France and Swiss border have given up on their cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in the experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg."" The streets of this small town are car free. The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.

Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles. The public transit was free of charge during the bane.

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week."" American now is has fewer car sales, people driving less, and there are fewer and fewer liscences each year. Americas love of motor vehicles seems to be subsiding. People are driving about as much as they did in 1995 which is 9% lower then the peak in 2005. Some people may blame the lack of cars and driving on the reccession. On the other hand people were buying less cars two to three years befor the reccession even hit. If this pattern presists sociologist believe it will be eneficial for cabon emissions and the enviorment. This is becuase transpertation is the 2nd leading cause of carbon emission. This could have negitive effects on the automotive companies but they are already rebranding themselves as mobiltiy companies. This allows them to have a broder range of personal vehicles. Cities like New York have established a bike sharing program. This allows people access to bikes accross the city instead of taking a taxi. Many of the young people accross the country have not even bothered to get driver's liscenses. Driving decreased by 23% between years 2001 and 2009. They instead plan activites where they can walk or ride a bike.

The age of the car may be coming to an end. Communities have started promoting a car free life style. Made othe ways of transportation avaliable. The younger people in the community have quit driving all together. Wether becuase it is good for the enviorment or a choice they had to make becuase of the city they live in. Transpotation is evolving into a public affair, not a personal one. The automotive industry may take a hit but in the long run this could be beneficial for our planet.

"eletoral college can be a very good thing cause it can mean also picking other electors. this can help us and our state alot. But it would depend on witch state we are located in.

Electoral Collge gives a chances for people in the Republican or Demicrat party to also vote. You would have to let your state elctors also have the chance to let them pick a canidate chance on who they would want as president. According to the

Office of the federal register they qoute ""The Electoral Collge consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to electoral votes is required to elect the president"" (source 1). Each canidates electors are chosen threw witch partys they are in and are also chosen to give a chance to vote. I do think we should keep the Electoral college because it gives a chance for even electors to vote.

when we vote we are also voteing for electors to work with the presidents and help him make desions. Accoriding to bradford plumer he qoutes that "" The single  best argument against the electoral colloge is what we might call the disatser factor"" (source 2). Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states. what a lot of people dont know when they vote they are also voteing for other electors.

A lot of americans do not trust the Electoral College because they feel its not right to also be chooseing electors at the same time. they feel it is unfair and not nesscary. They should have sepreate elections for electors.

"Summer projects are something all students know too well. Whether they are mandated by the school system, or by individual teachers, they can be hard to avoid. Even though summer should be a relaxing time away from school, these projects weasel their way into students lives and disturb the peace of summer. It is sometimes difficult for students to motivate themselves to do school work over the summer because they wish to forget about their responsibilities as a student all together. Although giving students educational freedom can be refreshing, in reality, teacher-designed projects are more efficient and beneficial.

It is best for summer projects to be teacher-designed because the students will have better guidelines that will lead them towards success. In my AP Biology class, we are often assigned projects. There was one instance where we could come up with any project we wanted with no limitations. At first I thought this was a great idea. However, when I was brainstorming ideas, I was stuck. I was afraid that whatever I came up with would not be exactly what the teacher wanted, which would have resulted in a bad grade. If this assignment was teacher designed, however, I would have felt much more confident in my finished project. If I was given the guidelines that come along with teacher-designed projects, I would have been able to manage the time I spent on this project more efficiently and I would have received a higher grade.

Teacher-designed summer projects are the best option because they are more helpful to the students. A recent study shows that students score higher on assignments that were created by the teacher than on assignments with less restraints. When students are given educational freedom, they can sometimes take it for granted. Some believe that because there are no real guidelines, they can slack off and not try their hardest. Projects given over summer break can give students an even bigger opportunity to do this because they are away from school. This amount of freedom can result in a bad grade. Clearly, this is not beneficial for students in the long run. It will lead to bad habits that can hurt their high school career.

Another reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they offer students insight to what their teacher is like, which can be beneficial when the new school year starts. Last summer I completed a photography project. This assignment was very specific, and there was an exact process for how we had to complete it. In the fall when I went to that class for the first time, I felt as if I already knew my teacher. Based on the summer project I had completed, I knew he would be very meticulous and his expectations were high. However, I was not as scared to enter his class for the first time because I already knew what the class structure would be like.

Although the modern education system has its flaws, teacher-designed projects are one of its highlights. Structure in the classroom--whether it be during the school year or over the summer--is always best. It allows students to use their time in a way that is more manageable and beneficial to them. Keeping this structure will allow students educational careers to be successful, which in the long run, is what school is all about. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"If their is a important thing my school should except, it is to have students involved with other activists, and if you want to know why I think it is a good idea, then read this. Since the principal has brought it to the schools attention that he will pass a rule that will effect the students everyday life. He wants us to chose if we want the change or not. Everyone in my school has voted and both sides are tied, so they want me to give the final say on the matter. I agree with this change because, it may provide experience in my future, it can expand my social and teamwork skills, plus it can tell me if I enjoy the club or activity that I signed up for.

The first reason I agree with the principals decision is because, it can expand my social and teamwork skills. One example it can improve my teamwork skills is by joining the student council and make big school board decisions with my team. Another example is that garden club can boost my social skills and find common interests with other people in a calm environment. And when I am older these skills will be important when you have a job of my own.

The second reason I agree with the principal is because, it will provide some experience in the future. One example is how it can provide some experience is by going to a club or activity where it explains important information about college and jobs. Another example is if I want to learn how to play chess with another person in the future then I would want to sign up for a chess club. There are many clubs to help and to guide other teens on the right path if they give it a chance.

The last reason I agree with the principles decision is because, it can tell me what I like and what I do not like as hobbies. One example is, when I was in forth or fifth grade I was in girl scouts. I did not like earning patches, so I stopped going to it. Another example is in seventh grade I found a club based on college and I loved it so I wanted to go to more activists like it.

In conclusion, I agree with this change because, it may provide some experience in my future, it can expand my social and teamwork skills, plus it can tell me if I enjoy the club or a activity that I signed up for. This is why it is a important thing that my school should except that students should get involved with more activities. So my vote will go to the change the principal offered. I wonder If a principal from another school declared that the students of the school would need to take part in one activity, what would the students of the school vote for.  ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Students will definitely perform and benefit better if they attend school at home. One reason,is that the students will get to concentrate better. It would also give students more time to sleep in and wake up less tired. lastly, students getting along with teacher and students.

Students being able to concentrate better at home than being at school is more assuring for their grade and learning. At school you are more likely to talk and be distracted by other students in the class, which can effect your learning capabilities. Learning in a class can be distracting sometimes when they are 30 plus students, cause of that the teacher not always able to answer your question when you need help. Teacher not being able to answer your questions results to you not understanding the material needed for the class. Learning at home is a better concentration zone for your learning environment

Getting more sleep for kids to wake up feeling refreshed is essential for their working abilities. Waking up so early for students can be hard, to the point some students start having attendance issues. Not going to school makes them not to learn and slack off at school. With other students they can't focus, because they are so tired that they zone out and not listen to the teachers lesson. Students being able to wake up later to do their school work online can improve their attitude and waking up issues. Kids being able to wake up at a later time to do work improves their grade and work rate.

A common problem schools have is that students tend not to like all the teachers they have. With some students they have a tendency to not do their work assigned. At times teachers have a habit of treating other different, so not everyone gets the right treatment. Student being able to do their own work they don't gotta worry who they get along, which leads to getting good grades and staying on task.

I believe doing school work at home benefits students in a positive way that helps them grow as a student. Also, making their learning life more easy but efficient as the same time. Their learning abilities improve as there isn't anything that can distract or make you feel inferior to everyone else.     ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools are considering allowing students to take classes from home by way of: online classes, and video conferences. Seventy percent of people agree that home-schooling is one of the best methods for students that dont learn as well in the classroom. Reasons could be that they are fearful of not understanding something and try to go with the flow along with everyone else, or they're just not comfortable.

Majority of students enjoy their homes more than anything and dont really care for the school buildings. Working from home would allow the students to have the freedom to work in the comfortable place they call home. Instead of having to wake up bright and early every day just to sit in classrooms and try to learn in a day what you can learn in an hour, it can be done within at least thirty minutes. It also gives students the chance to really focus on whatever is giving them a hard time and practice that more often than possible at school.

Being schooled from home lowers the window of opportunity for distractions by seventy-five percent. Being in the classroom with friends tempts students to talk to them, causing a distraction in the workplace. Eliminating that chance is vital to students who want to get to where they want to go. It could include the small things like going to the restroom when needed instead of asking ten million times a day, or even grabbing a snack during a lesson to keep students as comfortable as possible.

Online schooling could really give students a much more comfortable place to learn and boost their success rate. Sitting in the classroom chairs for six hours a day, and listening to teachers lecture all day can really be stressful and tiring. Especially to the students that don't really learn the best that way. Some students may not feel comfortable about asking a teacher about certain things in front of other students in fear of being called names,or being classified as, ""Slow learning."" This way could possibly give students to ask teachers about things they don't understand and fully grasp it.

Sometimes more one on one time with an educator is what students need and can be very beneficial to their learning abilities. Learning from home would definitely lower the student drop-out rate because they would really learn ways to balance their school work with their other activities,a skill that can get them far in life. If more school districts gave students the chance to work from home, more of them would take the opportunity and actually apply themselves more because of them being able to work in the comfort of their home.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal,

The school policy that you have decided upon is necessary that students must have a grade B average to play sports is not a good idea in my mind. Many students are at a grade C average and are playing meaning that they are already trying their best to be in the sports.

When a student is pushed a little to do better they react accordingly but, when they are pushed to across their limit they tend to feel overwhelmed and agitated. This overwhelming feeling can lead to procrastination and laziness, which will lower their grades which would then lead to a domino effect until they are failing. This could happen or the student would feel that they do not need to go to school anymore because they have nothing to look forward to there. Then the student may influence others and create a ring of truancy which is worse than low grades.

The students who enjoy these extracurricular activities usually are concentrating on doing their best in sports or their extracurricular activities, if we could move their priorities without side effects we could be able to reach higher levels of learning although a grade B average sounds like the best thing to do for this, it is not. Sometimes when students have a large load of homework or tests they feel the need to relax and forget about their stress, but if they need to get even higher grades the outcome would be either of these three extremes, extremely low grades, truancy, high grades (but not enough time for sports) without a lot of time students agitation would reach to a point where they might resort to drastic efforts to relieve stress, like suicide. This would then mold the school into an unfriendly jail cell, and other students will be effected.

Instead of a grade B average as the policy, you should have a tutor at the extracurricular activities who can put in a little bit of teaching while the students are having fun. The connection of fun and learning can lead grade C average students to achieve higher grades and do better in school. Also if you can design rewards for students with higher grades the students with low grades will want to reap from the tree of knowledge to receive rewards, this in turn will yield higher grades, less procrastination, less anger, and all without any harmful side effects.

"''When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person."" I think that the reason why people don't ask only one person for advice is that it gives you a chance picking more than one advice.

The thing I learned is sometimes whne people give you advice some people say it for their own good or either for their own bad. They say it for their own good because that person wants you to make good choices in life. The other people say it for their own bad so they can see you makke bad choices in life and see you not doing well. It's always going to be that good or bad advice to choice from. To make good choices you have to pick the good advice that the person gave you because they said it for their own good.

Not all the time people got the same opinion on things sometimes they have different opinions on the advice. You'll ask different people on advice and you will get either a bad one or a good opinion on the advice. Good opinons for the advice will always end up making you make good chocies in life or the road your walking in. The good opinions is for them to see you doing good things. The good opinions are always the good ones for you to choice from.

The other one is when you ask someone their are always people that got to say something about you. You never know what somebody got to say about the advice your asking for. They might judge you for asking for some type of advice. Some people always got good or bad opinions of you. People would judge for seeing you doing better because you went for a good advice.

A good reason why you should ask a couple people for advice is that you will always end up picking good choices. The more good choices you pick it would cause you walk in a good road. That's why you should ask more than one person to give you great advice. For example, say that you ask one person to give you advice and say that the advice they gave you wasn't great and you can't do noting about it , that's why it is important asking couple people for advice because asking only one person won't be great. That's why people always end up asking more than one person for advice for their own good.\

Lastly people asking for advice they would be expecting a good advice. For example, say that I ask a couple of friends for advice about soccer, I would be expecting a good advice not a bad one. As humans we always expect something great not bad. The people you should be asking for advice would be the ones who already expeirment it while going through it. You can ask someone who didn't went through but they might give you advice but it won't be great one.

In conclusion, it is always a good idea asking more than one person for advice. That would be for your own good and cause you make good choices.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I think it will be good in a couple years because some people can't really drive without help because the sensors will be more advance. It can really do wonders to peoples lives in the future such as going out easier being safe and more efficient. But you still need a driver's license if you want to drive a smart car because when there is a something major going on the car can't sense what other people are going to do. I really think it can do good in the future with the more advance sensors on the cars and we may have better technology. I think it can do real good in this world like herlping people that can be hurt or in pain.

In paragraph 5 and 7 they have great detail of how it will help advance more in the future. In paragraph 7 they said,""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" They are not fully there yet on the selfless driving subject but they will be soon because in paragraph 5 has detail on that because it said,""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect amd respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from thr sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a humman driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" It will be advanced in the future.

I really hope one day it will happen because we are damaging the plant by using the cars we are using now. It will damage the future for our children and future generations by doing what we are doing we need stop it because we don't want to have future generation clean up what we already can clean up now. So I do hope and dream the smart car can help with this problem in a couple years. Just help save the plant and leave it clean for generatons to come.              ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The idea of a driverless car has always been the goal set for future technology. This is seen in the constant stream of futuristic movies or shows. However, those only convey the positive and idealistic aspects of such vehicles. The ignorance of the negative information associated with them causes a personal disbelief in the cars. Driverless cars should not be developed due to the overwhelming evidence including that development/testing is against the law in the majority of the world due to the idea of possible malfunctions or irresponsible road behavior from the passengers.

A vast majority of people agree that testing should not occur due to possible danger. The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in Paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues.

One contribution to the rejection of testing is the possible malfunctions that could happen. All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to ""take over"". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all of the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Paragraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road.

The manufacturers of the vehicle contradict themselves when it comes to the passengers involved. Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with.

Driverless cars would allow too many flaws in the system and legality issues that prevent them for obtaining the title of a safter option. The manufacturers are attempting to make a car that is easier and requires less effort, but in doing so there is a plethora of issues that accompany it. The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of a ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents. Therefore, there are too many arguments for safety against the vehicles to even consider mass producing them. The driverless cars are much safer on the big screen than in reality.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principle,

Personally, I believe that students should be performing some sort of community service. Everyone needs to be doing there part in helping out with their towns, schools, and neighbors. Community service doesn't have to hard and time consuming, it can be as simple as picking up a piece of trash on playground.

Community service is a very important part of society, and development. Most people would agree. I'm sure everyone wants the youth to grow up into smart, kind, caring individuals- don't we? Yes we do. If no one does community service how is anyone supposed to learn any of it? Also, without community service the environment wouldn't be as clean in most communities, and that's because people help pick up garbage. I sure don't want to be living in dirty town. Do you?

In another scenario, what if parents cant watch there children when they get out of school. The kids, and the adults are stuck. Kids cant be alone, and adults cant miss work. So there in a bit of a pickle. That's when community service comes into play- again. No surprise there, if you ask me. Babysitters are your answer.

I guess all I'm trying to say is that community service is a very important thing to be doing. Its not only important for society, and others. But it can be very rewarding, and it looks good when applying for jobs in the future. In my eyes, everyone should be giving a little bit of there time to help others, and give back to there community, and in essence to help themselves in the long run. Thank you for your time.

"Wouldn't it be amazing if all students had the opportunity to be enlightened with new experiences? Those new experiences will open up their minds to explore different activities. All students should participate in at least one extra-curricular activity such as participating in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council.

One extra-curricular activity students could be exposed to is participating in sports. Sports allow them to have fun in a challenging game. The competition makes them more excited about the game. Sports also give health benefits to students. They will be more athletic and eventually enhance their skills in that sport. Lastly, they will learn how to work as a team. Teamwork is a useful skill that they will need for the rest of their lives. Sports may be one of the most popular activities, but there are more options that students will have to participate in.

Some other extra curricular activities students could be exposed to are working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Working on the yearbook will teach students computer and organization techniques. In addition, they will learn to collaborate ideas with their peers. Students will also learn how to be considerate of the opinions of others. Serving on the student council will give students the chance to have a leadership position. They will make important decisions and have a large impact on their school. They yearbook creators and student council members get to have interesting experiences that will last for a lifetime!

Although having extra-curricular activities offers so much for students, certain people share a different opinion about the topic. Some believe that the students won't have time for their personal lives. That might be true in some cases, but many activities are included in their every-day school schedule. In comparison to that belief, many think that none of the students' activities should be manditory. If we didn't have manditory activities, students wouldn't find their passions easily. Suprisingly, they also believe that there are better things students could be focusing on. Extra-curricular activities are not a waste of time; students get to have fun, interact with people, and learn at the same time! The knowledge obtained from these activitiess will be put forth to their dreams for the future.

To conclude, all students should participate in at least one extra-curricular activity such as participating in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Students' minds are still growing, so they must engage in whatever they can in order to be prepared to walk on the correct path in life. That path will not be a struggle to navigate through if we expose them now.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In this passage/story it talks about how we should challenge ourselves to explore Venus and how Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Venus is planet and when your laying down on your grass outside in the night when you wanna watch the sunrise go down you can see it because it is the brightest points of light in the night sky we can spot venus esaily in the sky when its dark. Venus is the closes to Earth in the terms of density and size. There are other planets too not just Venus there is a planet called Mars, Jupiter and Earth there was a planet called pluto its not a planet anymore because scientist thought it was so small and scientist didn't reall care about that planet. Some of our planets are called sister planets sister plants i think sister planets are planets that look the same scientist at his point don't know what are they or waht other name should they called them. When you see a word like this (NASA) what comes to your mind when you see a word like that NASA is the abberviation for The National Aeronautics and Space Administration you might wonder what is that this is something for scientists instead of saying the whole thing they just say (NASA) it's a easier way for scientists to communicate with each other. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus but the challenging part is the clouds when it rains and in the night you can't see venus because of the cloudsand how the clouds are too fat that they cover up Venus. Scientists are still woking on studying Venus well the (NASA) is because they are still trying to figure out why is Venus known as the small planet and the brightest one in the Earth ass well.

"The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is this a good or a bad thing? Answering this question is quite simple, because there is only one correct answer. All students participating in an activity is an excellent thing. There are several reasons why kids should be in extracurricular activities. Kids should partake in extracurricular activities because of the social benefits, students will learn valuable life skills, and there are numerous health benefits.

Firstly, students need social skills to survive everyday life. Many kids in this day and age lack the basic social skills they need to excel in life. Joining the different extracurricular activities that the school has to offer can help with that issue. Students will make new friends and build bonds that could last for the rest of their lives. Making friends isn't always the easiest thing to do. But being with people that are interested in the same activity as the student will help. Communication is key in the world. Talking through social media or text is all kids know. Being apart of a group will force the kids to communicate verbally. Talking verbally is a struggle for many kids and it's important that they learn how to. Once students grow up they will have to talk face to face. It's imperative that the schools teach this skill or kids will struggle further in life. Another reason is that team working skills can be learned through extracurricular activities. Students will have to work together to complete tasks or solve issues. In adulthood teamwork is a necessary skill to have. Teaching kids basic social skills at an early age will benefit them in the future.

Secondly, kids will learn excellent life skills while participating in extracurricular activities. Responsibility is one of those life skills. Whether it's a club, sport or some other type of activity kids will learn how to be responsible. For example, kids will have to take on certain duties for their activity. Time management will be necessary, because kids will have to make time for everything in their life. Both of those are great examples of how kids will have to become responsible. Another great thing extracurricular activities can give students is ambition and healthy competitiveness. Both of which are great qualities to have to be a leader. Leadership skills is an important thing that kids should have. There will be captains, presidents, or mentors in almost all of extracurricular activities. Students can become a leader in their activity. Being a leader will help students learn what it's like to have power. This will also cause students to have the ability to help their fellow students. Kids are the future leaders of the world. It's important that they have the skills to be able to lead the world. Many kids are too dependent or they could be smothered by people in their life. This causes students to not know how to handle things on their own. Extracurricular activities will give kids the chance to be independent. Students will have to handle certain situations or make decisions on their own. It's important for kids to have a decent level of independence and to not be babied their whole life. Kids won't be able to take care of themselves in adulthood, because they were reliant on the adults in their childhood. Those were just a few examples of the amazing life skills kids will learn by partaking in activities.

Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit kids mentally and physically. There are many health benefits of activities. Depression is an issue that many people have to deal with. It has been said that kids have been suffering from depression a lot over the past few years. Many kids feel alone or that they have no friends. Being in an extracurricular activity can show students that they are not alone. Children will feel less lonely if they are apart of something with other people. Students can bond over their struggles and even get help. Extracurricular activities can act as a support group for many students. It doesn't have to be just loneliness or depression. Kids that have a bad home life can find comfort in the group. Also, kids can become more confident in themselves. A problem that many kids face is the lack of self confidence. This can affect their grades, friendships, and most importantly their happiness. There are many other circumstances that kids might face. But all of the kids can share their pain and find peace inside of their group. Not only can activities improve mental health they can improve physical health. Many kids don't receive the proper amount of physical activity or even sunlight they need. Most children stay inside and are glued to their devices, which can lead to health problems later in life. Extracurricular activities can help children get out of the house and do something. Sports are a great example of an activity that will get kids moving. Mental and physical health aren't always a priority to society but they should be.

The principal enforcing extracurricular activities will have many positive effects on students. Social skills, the ability to communicate, and team working skills will be a great lesson that kids will learn. Students will become more responsible, independent and have enough leadership skills to run their own business. Being in an extracurricular activity will benefit the emotional, mental, and physical health of students. All of these things are highly important to be successful and happy in life. Many kids lack some of the skills listed previously, which is why it's a great idea to enforce extracurricular activities. Kids will be happier, better people, and more prepared for the future. Who would want children to not be any of those things? The answer to that is no one. In conclusion, all students should be in an extracurricular activity because of the social benefits, kids will learn necessary skills, and there are several health benefits. ",0,persuade_corpus,2

Extracurricular Activities aren't Always Good

Dear Generic_Name,

I understand that recently you have made the decision of making it mandatory for each student to participate in a club, and respectfully, I disagree.

Lets face it, transportation can be difficult.

Most students have working parents which would make it hard for them to drop off or pick up their student.

Another reason is funding, as a public school we don't have the most funds and even though I really am for clubs, we dont' have the money for that.

Also we would have to create so many new clubs to accommodate the students that don't already participate in extracurricular activities.

Even if we did have the funding most of the clubs would probably just be people goofing around in a random teachers class room.

Because to have a good club you need to first find students who have a similar passion, then also find at least one teacher who feels the same way.

Then repeat that process a bunch of more times to make sure everyone has a club.

Lets go back to the funding that we don't have, how are we supposed to pay for the equipment and supplies needed for that club?

The school probably can't afford for it, most middle school students don't have any money lying around, and the teachers make barley enough money as it is.

Some say that when students participate in new activities it can give them a better attitude and make them distress, but as someone who gets a lot of homework, and knows that everyone else gets that crazy amount of homework to, it would probably just stress them out even more then they already are.

Almost as soon as I get home I start on my homework, and I'm sure others do the same, but if I had gotten into a schedule of having set times to do my homework, then having that pattern inturupeted by a new club or sport, that I was also unprepared for, it would freak me out a little.

Besides, at this point in our life we should not have to worry about having enough time to do all of our homework, but even as it is we do.

So just think of the extra pressure that puts on us, and how that sets us up for failure in and out of school.

If they didn't already participate in a sport or club it's probably because they couldn't.

Weather it's because they didn't have a ride or maybe the just never found anything that interested them.

So I think that this makes it clear that even though students might meet some new people, or find a new hobby, it still doesn't compare to the large amount of cons.

Such as maybe not being able to get home, having little to no money for supplies and equipment, and of course the absolute tons of stress it will put on us as students.

Fondly,

"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation and we appreciate what it has done for us. It's a huge part of our election process but is time we move on from it. Their have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn't have enough electoral votes. ""It happened in 200, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888"" (source 3) This may have not happened more than twice but this could easily happen again and cause a catastrophe. This is why I disapprove of the electoral college.

This process is also unfair to voters because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (source 2).

There has been several of organizations and people who have tried to get the electoral college deleted from election processes including ..."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO"" (Source 2). These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country but there are times when things should be left in the past.

Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes. In my eyes it appears the electoral college has slightly to much impact on the outcome of the election. Imagine running for president and you when the hearts of the voters with popular votes but happen to lost the election because you didn't have enough electoral votes. How would you feel about the electoral college after that experience? This is why there is a need for change in the electoral college. Save candidates from losing an election that they should have one but didn't becuase they didn't have enough electoral votes.                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Summer break is typically a period of time where you can take a break from school and work and be relieved from all sorts of stress. But some schools assign students to complete summer projects to provide them continuous learning over the three month period time of being absent from school. The projects can either be teacher-designed or student-designed, which one should be assigned to the students? although both sides can be debatable student-designed projects might be less difficult I believe that it should be student based because the project would still complete its targeted goal and still help students have continuous learning over break.

Summer time is the time when most of us are outside making plans, meeting family, going around the world, and even just relaxing without any problems from the world. Summer break was made to help our brains take a time off of work, school, and stress. But even when we are on a break there is always something we need to do or can do that will help us have that continuous brain activity so when we are back from break we did not lose all of our knowledge and working habits and can hop right back into learning and working. But the work can be kept to a minimum and still have us have that constant brain flow and typically teachers dont understand that for students.

When assigning work to students over break, teachers normally would base the work and projects on how much time we have. If all the work would all be teacher-designed, they would see it like; the longer the break would be the more difficult and longer the assignments or projects should be. That would not be too fair for the students that deserve the break after having 9 months of constant learning and hard work in school. Also If the projects were to be teacher-designed it would not be fair to even the parents that are on break too because they have to stay at home and wait for their child to finish the work before starting their summer vacation or their family activities.

The purpose of the work over breaks is understandable, to ensure that we do not lose our knowledge and keep our brain working so when we go back to work it would be easier to get into learning and working as soon as possible. But the work can also be easier but can target he same objectives, this can be obtained if it were a student-designed project. Students know their limits and the targets for the projects so students can personally complete their own tasks and get the work done at their own pace. It would be way less stressful if students didnt have to base how much work they get done how they do the work by another persons standards that does not know what other things the student has to do in his or her life.

All in all summer is a period of time to be stress free but it can also affect our learning and working habits. But we still do need something to challenge our brain to keep those habits and students should be able to control how they do that. The work and their projects over break should be student-designed and not teacher-designed because we can keep the work to a minimum based on our schedule while still targeting the same objectives the teachers would want us to accomplish and both the students and teachers would both get what they want. The students get their break with minimum work and the teachers still get to know our brains are getting challenged.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Eighty- nine percent of people go to others when asking for advice because they may be unsure of others opinions, want different perspectives, or they want many different opinions. Although most know what they want , and when they want it , others dont and need an outside perspective for someone else. Advice is something that many people give and take everyday. Although when some people who just want a different perspective on things tend to ask many different people about the same advice. However that reason is everyone has different mindsets, therefore there most likely are going to be a variety of thoughts and answers. Even if one may have the best influence, some still want to be able to have others ideas and thoughts out on the table.

1 out of every 3 people will go to multiple of their peers for intake and feedback on questions or advice . There are many varieties of advice relationship advice , professional advice ,and educational advice. So when it comes down to advice that people may be unsure on they will go to others for their feedback. Although not all advice is the best advice, most advice is good. Advice is advice someone can give and get. So its important to some people who want multiple faces of advice to ask multiple people.

Therapists are doctors some of the main sources of advice . Mainly because they care about their clients mental and physical health.

Maybe someones boss has to give them advice . Many people give advice multiple times a day .

While many people are giving advice sometimes the advice that they give has the wrong influence. Giving someone good advice can help others make good decisions for themselves . Also getting good advice can make yourself make better choices . Some dont remember that asking for help or advice is not as bad as it may seem . People think when they ask for help the are automatically weak and that is not true.

Asking for advice makes people make better decisions and helps them influence the ones who look up to them . ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Attending classes from home is not bad. While students have a hard time in the classrom, distance learning can be best for them. Because they are distractions in the classroom, taking classes from home can help you focus and get you into college.

Because school is one of the main focus in life, you have to go in there and focus on your work. School will get you to your goal. However taking classes at home will give you a higher chance to reach your goal. Because there are no distractions and you are fully focused on your work. Also your gpa can increase, the higher the gpa the can take you to a great college.

Friends can be a distractor in the classroom. Having a friend is a good thing just for the right time. Friends are always fun to be around but school is more important. Taking classes at home there are no friends. You are focused on your work. You can hang out with your friends on the weekend or when school is over.

Taking classes at home can be more relaxing. You can accutually lay up in your bed and have a video confrence. Furthermore eating anytime is great, dont have to wait until lunch to go eat. Also you can be on your phone but only for the right things. Also you can sleep in until its time for class.

In conclusion, taking classes at home is highly recomended. Because it can rise your gpa with the one on one confrence calls. Also you are foucused because there is no one distracting you, taking classes at home can get you into college.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I have wrote you this letter to inform you of what I think we should do for our community service.

I think that you should give us some time of community service but don't make it so high that it will take up all of our time.

I have friends that like the community service and won't mine a lot of time. I also know that there are a lot of kids that will mind. If you want to please them I say you don't make the community service that long. I say at first you make every student do like two hours and then after that you have volunteers. I know some people will want to do like five to six hours of community service. This will also give a chance to the kids to make more friends and bond more. Sure I know there will be kids that will be bickering just for two hours but if you get every student to do that it will be fair.

Suggestions from me would be to make the service fun like playing with little kids like helping in classrooms. Or possibly helping the elderly. Doing things like these will make the kids want to do more because it will be heart warming to them and also like i said earlier it will be a good chance for bonding.",0,persuade_corpus,2

"NASA recently discovered an unusal landmark, on Mars. According to the text NASA discovered the landmark in 1976, and they weren't sure why the landmark was shaped how it was, a face. This shows that many people had many questions and disbelief of what NASA had been telling the public. This proves that many people where arguing that NASA was not being truthful about what they have discovered. Therefore, people where getting angry with NASA.

NASA was telling the truth, it was just an landmark. Many citizens thought it was a sign of intellignece life, and didn't believe what NASA was telling them. NASA was excited about this discovery, and wanted everyone to know. They didn't hide anything, there still was not any prove of intelligence life on Mars. NASA was saying, that if they found intelligence life, they would tell the whole world. They wouldn't try to hide such a mind blowing discovery.

Even though NASA was telling the truth about everything they have discovered, and told the public that if they found life on Mars, they would tell the whole world, that isn't something they would hide. The public still wasn't convinced. NASA would love to discover life on Mars. They sent more robots over to Mars to get better images, with better pixels, so they could get closer and see if there were huts and any other landmarks.

"The author in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in a good manner. The author gives serveral valid reasons as to why is should be explored and gives a logical explanation or solution as to the reasons why it shouldn't be. Everyday we're facing problems here on Earth and the idea of another planet that humans could possibly live on if things got too bad on Earth is amazing which could be possible in Venus is explored.

The given fact that Venus was ""Often referred as Earth's twin"" already gives hope that it could hold human life as we hold human life here on Earth now. Given, that wouldnt be possible without exploring it. Long ago, Venus held various forms of life and terrains such as some of the ones on Earth. Even today Venus still has some features similar to the ones on Earth. If safely explored it could possibly return back to that state and eventually become our prime place of shelter if tragedy strikes on Earth.

NASA is already working on safe approaches to study and explore Venus while working around its dangerous features. Stated is the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" Although that isn't necessarily studying it up close its a start and will give researchers more data to possibly make it safe to study in the future.

The author not only greatly supports his idea by giving facts and information about exploring venus but also includes that fact that an organization as big as NASA is already looking into the idea of exploring Venus. If exploring Venus wasnt a good idea NASA would be spending time or effort on it. The author goes as far into giving the solutions and idea researchers have come up with so far to face Venus's hostile conditions. Not only will exploring Venus benefit us humans in the long run by providing us with more information about the plant but as stated in the article, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In this essay in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System I was talking about how are the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

First on that time some computers are creating to recognice emotions, in the text say, "" Mono Lisa at least acccording to some new computer software that can recognize emotions."" She was according that she wanted to find ways to humans express they emotions, but later the Dr. Huang was developed a betters ways to humans can be communicate with others. In the text say, "" Dr. Huag and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humas and computers to communicate"" this mean that the Dr. Huag he is trying to find how calculate the feelings of humans and he is a expert at developing a computers that way people will be have how they communicate with others to the place and another pleace.

In addition this process begins with a cumputer 3-D this was called an "" action unit"" this is how they is trying to find how are the humans emotions. The Dr. Paul Eckman was a creator the FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) he creater this, then he classified whats are the emotions that he is trying to has. In the text say, Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic of the facial muscle."" This mean how the Dr. Paul uses this six category to see how the students express their emotions. I think that this is help us because they know when the students are sad, fear, happy , anger or samething like the Dr. Paul saids. These emotions is classified to find the emotions of people.

Now the new emotion they use in people and then they compare with the real face , in the article say, "" Using video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa,"" and "" Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" they use videos imagery to show the emotions when they use the creation that they creater to see how are the ractions, and then they compared against the neutral face with the face that they have.

Also there is a lot ways that they have to use in emtions but not all the ways are express the same ways. Some ways that they use are bad beacuse some humans don't wanted that people know their life and another humans wanted that they help them to find their emotions because they don't know how they feel or how are their emotions.

When they uses with students is so confused for them. Students is becoming confused how Dr. Huag predicts, in the article say, "" A classroom computer could recognized when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Haug predicts. "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The same make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" this mean that for some students are boring but fr the others students are good and they used one and other ways to recognize the emotions and finally they found and they know when the students used a lot the computers to compared animated face or something like that.

In conclusion I learn that they are different ways to humans express their emotions that is hard for the Drs. to find the emotions for recognize how humans feeling. Also this ways a lot of students use to compared their emotions with someone else.     ",0,persuade_corpus,4

My name is STUDENT_NAME and

I am with you on changing the school policy. I feel that it is fair that a student must obtain a B average to play in sports or other activities. Most things in sports whether your trying to make a career out of playing sports, comes down to what your grade is. Playing a sport or attending activities is more like a privilege that you have to work for to get. Changing the school policy is actually a real good idea because most students really want to play sports or attend activities and changing the policy to having a B average will get students to succeed in changing their grade to attend these things and even more successful in class. Most students don't want to be lazy and most students feel a passion for the sport or activity that they do or attend , so if playing a sport or attending activities means that they have to try hard, perceiver to try and bump up their grade even higher then that's what the students will do.

"Have you ever seen a face on Mars? A landform has been found on a region of Mars called Cydonia. Many argue that the the Face is either a natural landform or a landform created by aliens. Many information from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" can help come to a conclusion. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

The first supporting evidence to the claim is that the face would benefit NASA if the Face was made by aliens like people said. Real evidence of aliens would be an informational outbreak. NASA would be credited for an outstanding discovery, so why would they hide a true theory from arguing skeptics?

Second, several other natural landforms are just like the Face on Mars. The picture shows its reseblence to landforms common around western America. Mars Global Surveyor, Garvin, stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Also, The resemblence was ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of"" a face showing it is just a mesa.

Lastly, supporters of the alien theory believed the Face has alien markings that are hidden. They thought this because of wispy clouds in front of the camera taking the picture appeared. Because ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" anyone could see the alien markings they speaked of.

The alien conspirancy of the Face located on the Red Planet can be proven false. Details from ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" can support it is just a natural landform, a mesa.

"The author of this article uses many valid points and reasonings to support their idea. They refer to Earth and it's compatability to Venus a lot. They also use reasoning about Venus's temperatures and conditions. Although the author uses many disclaimers throughout the article, they still make good claims that studying Venus is worthy, despite the dangers.

In the second paragraph, the author states ""...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."". They are insuring that a helpful reason to research this planet would be because it is similar to earth, and a relative distance away. The author also states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."". This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well.

The author also gives ideas on how to help make a possible trip to Venus easier and less dangerous. They talk about using a bump-like vehicle that orbits or hovers about 30 miles above the surface. This vehicle has benefits, and also gives disclaimers. Some benefits would include astronauts being able to explore the land easier, avoiding the ""unfriendly"" ground, and keeping good air pressure. the text states ""however, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safey far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, redndering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This shows as a disclaimer to give unbiased proof ofnegative effects.

This article is full of evidence to support the authors idea of studying Venus. The author referred to Earth, recommended ideas, and a technology project used with old computers to support their claim. In conclusion, this article had very well put-together evidence, and proves a point that Venus should be studied despite the dangers.          ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"It can be better to ask other people their options because it can help you make a decision on something you need to do. When you want to make a decision on something it can sometimes be hard to pick what you want to do especially if you have multiple options. When you go to others though you can get advice from them such as what you might want to do for a project of even something with school. So others options can help you decide what you want to do and, when you get their options too you can come up with something more interesting.

Let's say I am writing a paper it's better to go to someone and get help and get options on if my idea is interesting or not. When you go to people for options like that they tell you based on what they think if your paper is interesting, then after you go to that person you can also go to someone else and get their feedback as well. When it comes to doing all of that you can figure out what you want to do or your paper and you have feedback from multiple people to help you figure things out to write a good paper.

Now let's say you are doing a project and let's say you are in science and you are doing a project and you can ether do it on metamorphic rocks or you can do a projects about poultion. When you do this project you can go to people and ask on if they like the idea and figure out on how you make your project interesting and they can you give you ideas based off what they are saying you should do. Then once you are done getting all your feedback you can go home and firgure out on what you would want to do like you could go home and make a project about polluion and put water in a container and put trash and oils in it to show it being pullited. And that could be your feedback from your friends to figure out your project.

Now let's say you have an outfit picked out but you don't know how it looks so you can ask someone or multiple people their opion on what they think about it. When you ask people about what they think it can help you because you can then find other things to be able to fix it. When you ask for other peoples opions they truly do matter because they can help you.

So therefore peoples opions are a very important thing because getting diffrent opions on things can impact and help you. Because if you don't have feedback you wouldn't get as many good ideas, or help on things. Also sometimes opions are the things that help you most because they give you better ideas or ways of thinking about something. So therefore the best thing and the thing that helps you the most is peoples opions but at the same time peoples opions don't always matter. But when they do make them count because opions really do help.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Many schools around the country assign summer projects for their students in order to make sure that the education of the students does not stop during the breaks. Summer assignments can also be a good way the teacher can get their students to get familiarized with the course work for the following year. In fact, more than 80% of high school AP classes give out summer projects. The summer projects assigned by some schools to their students should be teacher designed, reminding us that teachers are in control of their students' learning experience in and out of the classroom.

The teachers should design the assignments because they are the only ones that know what is going to be taught in the class. This way, the teachers can give their students the right amount of prior exposure to the contents of the course before the school year starts. Many of my teachers this year used this tactic. Specifically, my chemistry teacher gave out a project that was due on the last day of the summer break. The project was to read about the history of the periodic table, how it was formed, and how elements and compounds are named; then, we had to answer some questions made by the teacher about what we had just learned. The motive behind giving students this assignment was so that the students would get acclimated to the elements and how to use them. This helped not only students but teachers as well. Teachers often spend many classes building a base of information on a certain topic before they begin the true course work. Summer assignments are a way that teachers can bypass this and save precious class time for the true coursework. An AP Calculus AB teacher in my school did that this year in their class for the first time. They assigned a project that made students use skills they learned in Math Analysis, the preceding course, and strengthened them for use in Calculus AB. This ensured that the students now had a good base of the necessary skills, students had prior knowledge, and she did not have to spend some extra classes reviewing those skills. The teachers were able to help all parties involved by designing a summer project for their students based on what the students would learn in the class.

The teachers should design the assignments because they are the ones that grade them. Since the teachers are who the summer assignments are graded by, they should be able to design the assignment so that it meets their grading criteria. The summer project that the AP US History teachers designed for their students had a criteria included with the directions so that the students would complete the work that was expected of them by their teachers. This way the teachers received a final product that was enough to give students a satisfactory grade for their work. According to a scholarly article on the

New York Times , students received a better grade, on average, on teacher designed work than an autonomous student designed projects. The article summarized a study that showed that students better grades of assignments that required them to reach a certain criteria than assignments that gave the full autonomy on the assignment. It can be predicted that this was the case because it is easier to grade for the teachers and create a project for the students when they know exactly what the teacher wants and expects. When teachers set a criteria for summer assignments, they can control quality and quantity of the information that the students soak in.

Summer assignments can be designed by the teachers in a way to ensure that the teachers can learn about their students and their skill sets prior to the start of the class. When the teachers know more about the students, it can make the experience of the students and teachers more pleasant. My English teacher in grade eight made her students write two paragraphs about themselves as a part of their summer assignment. Then, she was able to use a more personalized way to teaching when students did not understand a certain topic. She did this because, by her experience, it is easier for students to learn about a topic when it relates to them. This was part of the reason she was one of the more successful teachers in the schools in terms of grades and standardized test scores. Teachers can also use the summer assignments to get a gauge at the level of comfort of the students with the course material before the course starts. My Algebra 2 teacher shared with her class that she gives out summer assignments so that she can see how much her students know the concepts. By doing this she was able to see the level her students were at with their knowledge, and she planned some classes to spend extra time on those concepts to help strengthen that knowledge. The teachers used their summer assignments they designed to help them better the learning of their students.

To conclude, summer projects are something that many teachers use to their advantage for the students. This is important to students because the teachers design the project to ensure they get information about their students to make their students more successful in the class. Teachers can use the summer project to expose students to the course, make sure that the student understands the sort of work that will be expected in the class, and learn about the students themselves. That is why teacher designed summer projects are essential before school starts each year.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Humans are so diverse. Some may be similar, but none are the exact same. Students are no different, even though they may be learning the same information, the way students understand and learn that information can be vastly different. Teachers help students learn materials through a variety of methods, like projects and tests. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student designed, proving that there are many different ways of learning.

Depending on the student, some methods of learning are incredibly more beneficial than others. When I learned vital concepts such as multiplication, the way my teacher taught was through constant out loud repetition of the material, which helped my classmates along, but not me. I needed to see the problem worked out and look at the numbers because I had trouble picturing all the math and numbers in my head. Not being able to understand that basic concept of multiplication was detrimental to my math abilities and led the following years of my math career to be absolutely exhausting. This same scenario could take place involving summer projects. A teacher could give a student a summer assignment to help them learn about a concept in that class, but if the design of the assignment was difficult for the student to understand, it could be more hurtful than helpful. The entire reason teachers and schools assign projects over the summer is to assure that students will continue to learn during their break, but how are the students supposed to learn if they can't understand or have trouble with the assignment?

Projects are meant to provoke students to think, and having students design the project themselves is a great way for them to think more and therefore learn more. If students designed a summer project, they would have to think about what to do since they most likely won't have as many guidelines that a teacher typically would give. This allows students the opportunity to be creative and think outside the box. Students could then potentially learn a lot about themselves and not just whatever the subject of the project is. If the student creates the project themselves, it seems more likely that they would actually enjoy the project. And if they enjoyed doing the project, they will remember it more. I don't remember the material from my psychology summer assignment this year. All we had to do was research and write about a basic concept from psychology. I do, however, remember the Latin project I did in seventh grade. I think this is because I was allowed to do the project on anything related to Latin that I wanted. All my teacher asked of us was that the project was somehow Latin related. I decided to do my project on ancient roman customs, specifically the different rituals performed as a person reaches certain ages. From that project I remember things like that at six months old a young roman boy gets a round pendant called a bulla to protect them from evil spirits and when they reach age twelve the receive a new type of toga and more. I could not tell you about the five methods of observation used in psychology, which is what my summer assignment this year (11th grade) was about.

Some may argue that having students design summer projects is a bad idea because the typical student is lazy and will make an easy project design so that they won't have to actually learn anything. If this is true, having a teacher designed project does not change that situation. The reality is that if a student is lazy and doesn't want to learn, they will not learn. For my psychology summer assignment, I was lazy during the summer and did not want to do it, but eventually I did it the day before they school year started and learned nothing because it was boring and I wanted to get it over with. However, if the assignment was to research anything I wanted about psychology, perhaps it could have turned out like my 7th grade Latin assignment and I would've actually learned something. From personal experience I can say that the best way to combat an apathetic student is to gain their interest somehow, which could be done by allowing them the freedom to design their own project. For example, I loved reading

Frankenstein in English, but after having to write so much about it I no longer like it and don't really remember much of what happened.

Even if a subject is interesting, the desire to do a project on it can be crushed by the formatting of the project. Allowing students to do whatever format they want could make students gain interest and want to learn more about a subject compared to doing something they don't want, like writing an essay, which may make them harbor resentment toward the subject instead.

If a school decides to assign a summer project, the students should be the ones to design them, which shows that there are many ways people learn. By understanding that some children need to be taught in different ways, people can better educate the youth of America. Improving the way the people are educated can give society more informed citizens who are confident in their abilities and work better and smarter. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Summer break is the time when students get to relax and forget about everything they learned about during the school year. Many teachers design a summer project to help this dilemma. Teachers should let students design their own summer projects. This helps students want to do the assignment and they can make it suit them intellectually.

When teachers give summer projects they have made, students tend to not do it. This is because they might think it is boring or they just do not want to do it. There are more interesting activities for kids to do during the summer. So, if they do not like it, they will decide to do those activities instead of the project. For example, when I was younger, my teacher gave us a project where we were required to read the book and answer the questions. The whole summer I would pull it out and then put it right back; then go play outside with my cousins. The reason I did not do it was, because it did not catch my attention enough for me to even get started. I had not learned anything all summer and my teacher was not happy. She was even more disappointed when she learned none of the class had even touched the book. The idea of us learning and keeping our brains educated had failed. Students need a project that is going to catch their attention and keep it there. The summer project would have been more effective if she had allowed us to do our own project.

If students make their own project, they can make it suit them more comfortably. A student may not understand the topic of the project their educator has assigned them. Then, they end up not doing it at all, simply because they cannot comprehend it. A student knows their own intellect, therefore they can make a project that is not difficult for them. Once my friend had a teacher would always assigned them hard summer projects. She would always be puzzled and never got to finish them. So, the next summer her teacher finally decided to let them make their own projects. My friend successfully made her own assignment and aced it when she got back the next school year. It becomes easier for a student when they have made a project that they can really understand.

Many people believe that teachers should assign the project, because they know the criteria. However, this is a false statement, just because a teacher knows more does not mean they can create a project that happily suits their students. This is because they will actually do their summer project if it fun and interesting. They also can make the material geared more towards their level of knowledge of a subject. To help, teachers could wait a month before the end of the year and let the students come up with their own personal project that is fun to them. They could set aside class time every day, so students can perfect their assignment and have a intriguing summer project. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Often times, people don't ask for advice from more than one person, which can sometimes result in bad decision making. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can get different perspectives, receive help from people who are highly experienced, and be given the chance to have a brighter future.

One of the reasons seeking multiple opinions helps someone make a better choice is because they can get different perspectives. People can listen to others' point of view, which may make it easier for them to decide what decision they're going to make. For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year. Finally, after listening to both sides, I decided to take Geometry Honors. Listening to different perspectives can be beneficial, but people can also receive help from people who are more experienced than them.

Another reason seeking multiple opinions helps someone make a better choice is because they can get help from people who are highly experienced in their field. Receiving help from professionals doesn't necessarily mean that they know what's best for someone, but they can certainly serve as assistance if someone is facing a problem. For instance, a couple of months ago, my friend Generic_Name was struggling with drafting her college resume. She was at a disadvantage because she didn't know what steps to follow to write her resume, and the worst part of it all was that her school guidance counselor was unwilling to take the time to help her. At first, she attempted to write it herself without any guidance, but then her old friend, Generic_Name, who already graduated from college and is now an English professor at Generic_School, was visiting during that week. He noticed how frustrated she was with her essay, and decided to sit down with her and give her some pointers. After finalizing her resume to the best of her ability, Generic_Name decided to make a copy of it to give to her English teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, who is a notable alum from Harvard University. Ms. Generic_Name gave her some feedback, but overall, her paper was ready to submit. Generic_Name sent it out to Santa Monica University, and received her acceptance letter a few months later. Receiving help from highly experienced people can also lead to a brighter future.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions helps someone make a better choice because they can be given the chance to have a brighter future. By making just one decision, your life can turn upside down. For example, my close friend, Generic_Name, just graduated from CalTech with his Bachelors and Masters Degree in cyber security and software development. He's thinking of applying to Microsoft to be an engineering coordinator, but he's unsure if he will be accepted. He knows that hundreds of thousands of candidates apply each year, but only a small number of people are accepted. Generic_Name decides to ask for advice from one of his friends, Generic_Name, who currently works at Microsoft. Generic_Name told him that with his work ethic, he would surely get fired during his first week of the job. Generic_Name wasn't sure if this was constructive criticism, or if Generic_Name was jealous of him and wanted to see him fail. Generic_Name thought about it, and decided to ask his college professor, Mr. Generic_Name, what he thinks he should do. He told him that he would thrive working at Microsoft and he would regret it if he didn't apply. After much consideration, he decided to apply. Five months later, he received his acceptance letter in the mail and happily took the job. He is now well known throughout the country. If someone is given the chance to do something great, they shouldn't turn it down.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can listen to others' point of view, get help from trained professionals, and can be given the opportunity to have a successful future. People should take initiative to ask for help and shouldn't rely on only one person's opinion. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"It is ridiculous that you think that this natural landform is created by aliens. It aliens would have created this why would they not leave a sign that it was them.

I believe this is a natural landform for many reasons. One is that the region of mars called Cydonia is filled with natural landforms like this one but this one just looks like an Egyption Pharaoh. Why would aliens go to Cydonia and make an alien artifact when Cydonia is filled with natural landform just like that one? On April 8, 2001 another spacecraft snapped an image of the face looking natural landform and found no trace of any sign of alien activity near the landmark. There were no people, airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even any small shacks anywhere near the landform. Why would aliens take the time to make this landmark if they were just going to leave and never come back.

It makes no sense why you would believe that aliens would have make this landform. You should believe me I am the scientist at NASA. In conclusion just trust me, the scientist at NASA, and just believe that this landform is natural not made by aliens.   ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"It is a good technology to have. People can lie about how they feel. In the painting of Mona do u really know she was happy. No a comupter can say that but it a painting of the person that is not around. So you don't know it just he face everyday. She has no eyebrows so how can you so she is suprised. In the text it says your eyebrows Well you cant have that if there isn't any.

So thing that it is a good technology to have but it just not proven to work on paint. The students don't realy need to know how to use a computer to see how people are feeling. People most of the time you can tell by looking on there faces. Why is it important to know picture or a painting is feeling when you look at it should do it for you. How do you say she is 83 percent happy you can't put that like it a math problem. Because you don't know how see really feels because it could just be a face for all we know.

That is why I think is would be worthless for students to use it. They cant use a comupter to see how someone is feeling inside them. It is a good advancement and can be use but in another way. People can hide how they are feeling just by there face. It also not something students need to learn to go far in life.",0,persuade_corpus,1

One reason why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys Program"" is because, not only them but, you could be helping people affected in world war 2. In paragraph 2 it talks about how world war 2 left europe in ruins and the UNRRA need people's help to clean the place up and go out to sea's to get cows or anything that is afloat in the sea. The second reason you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys Program"" is because you get to have adventure's and go to different countries you have never been to! In paragraph 5 it says""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" It could be a once in a lifetime thing! The third reason you should join this program is because not only do you work all the time, you get to play games with your friends like volleyball and tennis, and much more! In paragraph 8 it says ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis turnaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whitting,and games also help pass the time."" So, over the waiting time to get to the place you are heading you get to have fun.

"Dear principal,

If you decide to only let students with a B average play on sports teams then you would encourage students to do better in school, and also teach them that they should do the best that they can also that their grades shouldn't be lower that a B average. People with a low average should be rewarded doing things that they like to do because then they will think its okay to have low grades because no matter what your going to let them play on the sports teams. That should be a reward to play on the sports team.

Also kids would try harder to in school if you only let B average students play.

You will encourage students to do better by not letting them get away will bad grades and being able to play on a sports team. You would also encourage them by showing them responsibility on doing their work and trying their best to succeed in school. That's really important too. So you'll have more students with a high average then low because most students in school like to play sports and some will do just about anything to be on the teach.

You should reward students for having bad grades and if you let low average students play sports then you'll show them that no matter they do they will get away with not doing work or trying their best. In sports you have to try your best to win in school it's the same because you have to try your best to get the grades you deserve. If you reward students with low grades doing sports then they aren't trying their best or getting the grade they deserve.

You'll have more students with a good grade then you will with a bad grade because if you reward students with good grades then you'll get more students wanting to get better in school then you will if you just let students with bad grades play sports.

I hope you that you will see that it would be better if you let students with a B average play because then your going to have students want to do better so they can play sports in school. Also the students would learn to be responsible for their work and they would also learn that if they try their best then they would get the grade they really do deserve.

"Dear state senator, I think that we should change to start voting by popular vote because it will be easier for the voters and is a more realistic way of voting.

When voting and following the rules of the electoral college, many voters get confused. As is says in source 2, many voters vote for the wrong person. They also don't always get controll over who they vote for. Say they voted for one canidate to be their state senator, well with that one person comes many people that have ""pledged"" themselves to that canidate. They would be voting for the canidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don't even know it.

Also as they say in source 2, the election of 2000 was a huge mishap in presidential election history. In states like Louisiana, they had people replace democratic electors so that the popular vote that would've went to one of the canidates, didn't actually go through. Although the electoral college is good for getting exact numbers and helps solve disputes( source 3)it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore. Voters are easily confused when voting and many do not follow up on what is happening during election time. I think that a better way to votee would be to vote more often and give the electors another chance to be relected so that after a few months if voters changed their mind then they could reelect someone else.

Popular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen.

"When summer time comes around, students get over 70 plus days of no school. Throughout those days, having school require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a good idea. Having fun and taking a break is good also, but I know students can find time to work a little bit on school and learn as the days goes on. These summer project should be teacher-designed because the work will allow students to prepare for the coming year, help students not forget what they have done, and challenge students to actually understand and do the project.

Every year school and school work gets more and more challenging. When allowing teachers to design these projects, it will not only be based on the following school year, but it will also be helpful for students to know in advance of what they should be expecting. Teachers know what is best for their students. So when you allow teachers to design these projects, you are allowing these students to come into the school the next year knowing at least a little bit about the class. For example, as a high school student, when you get summer projects it usually consist of things that you are going to need to know for the coming year. This means if you don't want to be behind or clueless the coming year, you are going to have to do the work. This also means to know the things for next year, you are going to have to review or have remember the things you have learned last year. This is really a great thing because these projects will allow you to have something school related to work on when you are not in school for that long period of time.

In two months, it is surprising how much someone can forget things. These teacher-designed projects will allow students to have to think and remember things they have learned before. This will conduct in students looking through their old notes or looking up these information, which will help retrace their memory. As a student myself, I know what it's like getting a project over the summer and not getting anything over the summer. The summers you don't get anything, can even lead you to forgetting how to write well. Not receiving anything over the summer can cause memory lost and have students not prepared for the following year. And usually, what you learn the following year conduct some of the things you have learned before and when you are not prepared you are behind. Summer Projects are usually not that long and can definitely be done in the two months you are given. This will help students preparing for the coming year and allow students to have something to do school related through out the break. Which might be disliked by students, but it is something important to do because education is most of the time the key for a better life. People in the world go through so much trouble to get educated while majority of the people in the United States get it for free and even have free transportation. So at the end of the day there is nothing for students to complain about.

Even though it could be good to have a student-designed projects, to allow students do the things they are interested in. It is not always safe to go that path, because as students they don't usually want to do work. So when you allow them to choose their path, they are most likely to choose the one that requires less time and is usually something they are not interested in. So to make it safe and challenging, teacher-designed projects should be chosen as the path to be taken when creating a summer project. These projects could challenge students to be outside the box, which will allow creative thinking and actually make students work on it because even though taking a break from school is good. Making students do summer project will make students not have a problem the following year. This will allow students to take a bit of time out of their day to do something that is very useful and and important in their educational time. Because what is the point of learning for about 10 months, if you can simply forget is in the 2 months of not receiving anything to retract your memory.

In conclusion, these summer project should be teacher-designed because the work will allow students to prepare for the coming year, help students not forget what they have done, and challenge students to actually understand and do the project. Things like this will not only help students stay close to school, but will also continue educating students even when they are not in school.",0,persuade_corpus,0

"As a driver I feel that transportation is very important when getting to your destination, and feel that it can be improved.

But I also feel that the ""driverless car"" is not the way to do it.

For one the driverless car is not even driverless, you still need a driver and it questions the safety of the driver and those in the car.

First of all the car still requires a driver, which if we are talking about a driverless car, is useless.

The text states that the car will notify the driver, when to shift gears and take over the navigating, when driving through work zones and around accidents.

By doing so it is not an actual driverless car if it still has to notify the driver to switch gears, to drive.

This also leads to my second point, which questions the driver's safety.

It is said that the car will notify the driver when to drive, with a vibration that is being given off by his or her seat.

Therefore not knowing or feeling the vibration, to alert the driver the are going to switch gears to drive the car, can lead to a major car accident.

That being said it is not the best idea to carry out this experiment involving the driverless car, since it is not actually a driverless car and questions the safety of the people in the car.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The brightest point of light in the night sky, the our sister planet, or sometimes called the "" Evening Star"", thay all are as know as Venus.

"Why Everyone Should Have to do an Extracurricular Activity

Have you ever thought of something that you might want to do outside of school, but you never got around to it? Well this new idea might help you and I will explain why this should become a rule. I think that everyone should have to do an extracurricular activity outside of school. There are plenty of reasons for this, starting with meeting new people. You could meet a whole different friend group than you are used to and really bond with them. Also, it could get your mind off something, whether it is fighting at home or being bullied at school. If you do a sport, it could help your body too. Maybe you're not happy with your appearance, weight, or strength, sports help them all. Maybe in your activity, you could help someone who is going through a tough time with family or bad grades or anything bad going on in their life. Lastly, you could learn new things like a new sport, a certain type of art, or even discover a new talent you never new you had.

First off, doing an extracurricular activity helps in so many ways starting out with meeting new people. If you can go into someplace new and make a couple of friends, then you can be able to find a safe place with the new group so you don't have to feel like theres only a handful of people you can go to for advice or help or even just have a good time. Also, making new friends that you've never met before shows that you can work well with almost anyone and not just that handful of people.

Next, it could help get your mind off something that is just not falling into place right now. Maybe you're not getting along with your parents, or a loved one died, or maybe you're even getting bullied at school. When doing an extracurricular activity, all of your fears and sorrows just drift away like you don't have a worry in the world and you can just be yourself. Sports can definitely help with this, because when you are running up and down the court and hitting a baseball as far as you can, all of the stress in your body gets let out and you feel free. This ties in with making new friends too, because your new friends can help you get your mind off that one thing that keeps bothering you.

Especially sports help with this reason, because they help improve your entire body making you feel like a whole new you. Maybe your weight is a little above what you want it to be or your arms are too weak to lift a chair. Either way sports can help with this significantly. When you run up and down the court, it gets your blood flowing and moving at a higher speed helps you loose weight. In baseball, half of the game is throwing a ball, and in order to be able to throw it hard, you have to have arm strength. This should motivate you to work to make your arm stronger by lifting weights and doing band exercises. Also, playing a sport and making your body stronger will help make your bones strong so that if you fall on an arm lets say, its less likely to break and if it does, then it won't be severe.

Relating to where I talked about the activity or a friend helping get your mind off something, you could also help someone else if they are in the same shoes as you. Maybe they are having even worse than you which might seem impossible, but it is a reality for so many people. The least you can do to help them, is be a friend to them even if they are not your first choice. Maybe the reason they are doing the activity is to find some help from someone like you. You never know what could be going on in someones life, so be that good teammate that passes the ball to them and show them how to draw something they didn't know how to.

Last but not least, you could learn something about yourself or how to do something you never knew how to but always wanted to learn. I've always been a baseball and basketball player but maybe if we had to choose a new activity to do, then I could choose another sport like soccer or tennis. Maybe even, I could branch out and try something that's not a sport like art or possibly learn something that I could do that I never knew I could, like play guitar. That would be the beauty of the new rule, learning something new about yourself that could last you a lifetime and maybe even make you some money one day.

Yes, these after school activities can take up a lot of your free time, but when you are doing/playing them, it should be so fun that it feels like it is your free time. But if you can come out of an activity with at least one new friend and some peace of mind it should all be worth the time. Myself, I have done many extracurricular activities in my life which include mission trips with church, boy scouts, sports, and many others. For instance, the past two years my mom and I have gone with the church to a mission trip in St. Lucia. This has probably been the most special activity to me, because we got to work with kids from the age of four, all the way through the age of fourteen. The St. Lucia trips were so special to my mom and I, that we are going to Slovakia this Summer to teach the kids and teenagers English. Also I never knew that I was good at basketball until about six years ago I joined a league and started playing and quickly realized that this was something that I'm good at and want to do the rest of my life. I started playing baseball when I was four. My mom signed me up for tee ball and I had so much fun that I wanted to play again. So I kept on playing and again, I realized that I was actually pretty good. Growing up baseball has been a key to my success and I have now played on many different travel ball teams and hopefully the middle school team this year. That would be a dream come true because I have worked my whole life for that. This goes to show how much joining an extracurricular activity can do for you. I will do everything in my power to help this rule that the principle has proposed to make this an actual rule so that kids at our school and others can enjoy ourselves.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Driverless cars are the next big thing to come into our world. Driverless cars would be such a help to everyone around the world. With all the traffic out there you get tired of stoping and going, then hitting the gas then the brake. Well now you dont have to do any of that with driverless cars. They'll do it on their own, all you have to do is steer at times. So, with having driverless cars they will do less harm to the enviroment, safer for your freinds and family, and it's easier on you.

First, the driverless cars are less harm to the enviromen. Just think of all the taxis out there in the big cities wasting all the gas that we put into them. It harms the enviroment way too much. With these special driving cars it's a proved fact that they use half of the fuel today's taxis use. That means it's not polluting the land as much and the oxygen will be cleaner and fresher as well. With all of the pollution going on our ozone layer is decreasing rapidly and ith the makings of these cars it wont harm the ozone layer as much now, and as a matter of fact it will help it.

Moving on, the driverless cars are all in all safer than modern day cars we drive everyday to world and back. At night when you cant see very well and your in the back country it can see up ahead way farther than you ever can. Here's a situation for you, say your driving along in a regular and a deer runs out of the field and SMACK! Now your calling a tow truck in the middle of night and your kids are scared.

"Schools will stop students from succeeding if students learn online. Many schools are now allowing students to attend classes by video conferencing and other online ways. Students in certain schools have not just taken, but also passed core classes along with electives through online programs. Teachers use video calling applications like Skype or FaceTime to teach and educate students. Students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable.

One reason that students should not learn online is because there are too many distractions in a students home for them to focus entirely on the subject at hand. For an example, if a student has younger siblings running around their work space at home, the student will not get a proper education because they will be constantly distracted. Another reason that students should not learn online is because students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom. There are tons of online applications that help students cheat on tests and even simple worksheets given out by educators. If a teacher cannot physically see the student right in front of them taking a test or working on a paper, then that teacher cannot be sure that the student does not have an electronic device present that is helping them get all the answers off of the internet. The final reason that students should not learn online is because the internet is unreliable. When a student is working online, their internet might not always be stable, WiFi might not always be available in the students home, the teacher and students devices might not always be compatible with one another, and finally, the student might not always have access to a device.

Many people believe that schools should offer long distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, however, students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable. Students should stick to the traditional way of learning, it has worked for hundreds of years in the past. We should not change the way of our education system if their is nothing wrong with it to begin with.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

I do not believe that every student should be required to perform community service. Not all students do have the time to go and meet a mandatory community service quota. If you were to assign students to complete a community service program and give them a grade on it, many students would fail. This would cause the students to be ineligible to do other school activities that they have signed up for.

However, I do support you with thinking that people should do community service, after all, it is their community. I think that instead of making it a mandatory thing to do, you could set up an extracurricular club that would help the community. This would make it easier for some students to get a grade for what they are doing and still have time for other activities that they have signed up to do.

If you were to make it a club, then you would be able to require the members of that club to go and fill a community service time quota for the year. Many school clubs do this as a way to make the members proud of their community and to show that the club members and the school care about what the community has to offer and what their community stands for. The club would mean something to everybody. This also has a chance of increasing the amount of participants in community service.

I thank you for considering what I have had to say about this. Please make the decision that you feel would be best for everyone involved. I also applaud you for supporting your community.

Sincerely,

Student",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, was a man of great ambition and determination. He believed that achieving goals required a combination of hard work, perseverance, and a clear understanding of what was needed to be accomplished. In this essay, I will explore the strategies that Jefferson used to accomplish his goals, as well as the potential obstacles that he may have encountered, and discuss the motivations behind wanting to achieve a goal.

One of the key strategies that Jefferson used to accomplish his goals was to break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. He believed that by focusing on individual steps, he could make steady progress towards his ultimate goal. This approach is still used today by many successful people, who understand that achieving a goal requires consistent effort and a clear plan of action.

Another strategy that Jefferson employed was to surround himself with like-minded individuals who shared his vision and supported his efforts. He recognized that having a strong team of people working together towards a common goal could greatly increase the chances of success. This is something that many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders still practice today, recognizing the importance of building a strong team around them.

Of course, there were likely obstacles that Jefferson encountered while working towards his goals. One potential obstacle that he may have faced was resistance from others who did not share his vision or who believed that his goals were unattainable. In order to overcome this obstacle, Jefferson likely had to be persistent and continue to work towards his goals, even in the face of opposition.

One example of someone who has successfully accomplished a goal is Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla. Musk has set ambitious goals for himself and his companies, including colonizing Mars and revolutionizing the automotive industry. In order to achieve these goals, Musk has had to overcome numerous obstacles and setbacks, but his determination and persistence have ultimately led to his success.

Ultimately, the motivation behind wanting to accomplish a goal can vary greatly from person to person. For some, the desire to achieve a goal may be driven by a need for recognition or validation from others. For others, the motivation may come from a desire to make a positive impact on the world or to pursue a personal passion. Regardless of the motivation, achieving a goal requires a clear plan of action, consistent effort, and the ability to overcome",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"First impressions are a powerful tool that can shape people's opinions and images of others and places. They are often based on superficial factors such as appearance, behavior, and environment. While first impressions can be misleading, they can also have a lasting impact on how people perceive and interact with others and places.

One of the most significant ways that first impressions can impact people is through the formation of opinions. People often form opinions about others based on their first impression, without taking the time to get to know them better. For example, a person may assume that someone who is dressed in a certain way is unintelligent or unprofessional. Similarly, a person may assume that a place is dirty or unsafe based on its appearance. These assumptions can be based on stereotypes and prejudices, and can lead to negative opinions that may not be accurate.

First impressions can also impact how people perceive and interact with places. For example, a person may be hesitant to visit a new city or neighborhood based on their first impression. They may be scared or intimidated by the unfamiliar environment, or they may assume that it is unsafe or unfriendly. This can lead to missed opportunities for exploration and cultural exchange.

Additionally, first impressions can impact how people remember and recall information about others and places. Research has shown that people tend to remember details about others and places that are associated with their first impression. For example, a person may remember the color of someone's clothing or the layout of a room based on their first impression. This can lead to biased and inaccurate memories that may not reflect the true nature of the person or place.

In conclusion, first impressions can have a significant impact on people's opinions and images of others and places. While they can be misleading, they can also be powerful tools for shaping how people perceive and interact with the world around them. It is important for individuals to be aware of their first impressions and to make an effort to overcome them, in order to form accurate and unbiased opinions.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Introduction:

In today's world, education is a crucial part of our lives. Students are expected to perform well academically to achieve success in their future careers. However, not all students perform equally in school, and some may struggle to maintain good grades. One way to address this issue is by implementing a policy where students with less than a C grade cannot participate in any school activities. In this essay, I will argue that this policy can benefit both students and teachers.

Benefits for Students:

Firstly, this policy will motivate students to work harder academically. Students who are struggling to maintain good grades will understand that they need to improve their grades to participate in school activities. This will encourage them to focus more on their studies and work harder to achieve better grades. Moreover, students who are not participating in school activities may feel left out and disconnected from their peers. By implementing this policy, they will have an opportunity to participate in activities and feel more connected to their school community.

Benefits for Teachers:

Secondly, this policy will make it easier for teachers to manage their classrooms. Teachers will know which students are struggling academically and can provide them with additional support to improve their grades. This will help teachers to focus on teaching and not on managing students who are not participating in school activities. Moreover, teachers will have more time to plan and organize school activities, which can improve the quality of education for all students.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, implementing a policy where students with less than a C grade cannot participate in any school activities can benefit both students and teachers. It will motivate students to work harder academically, encourage them to participate in school activities, and make it easier for teachers to manage their classrooms. While some may argue that this policy is too harsh, it is essential to ensure that students are performing well academically and have the opportunity to participate in school activities. Therefore, I strongly recommend implementing this policy in schools.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Hey there!  So, you know how there's this whole debate going on about whether high school should be three years instead of four? Like, I know some people think it's a good idea and some think it's not, but I think it's like, really interesting to think about the impact it could have on us students. 

Okay, so, like, the main advantage of having a three-year high school is that it would give us more time to focus on our interests and passions. I mean, think about it, if we had an extra year to explore different subjects and activities, we could be like, super prepared for college and stuff. Plus, it would be like, way easier to balance schoolwork and extracurriculars, you know?  Like, I know some people who are already feeling super stressed out about trying to do everything, and a three-year high school could help with that.

But, like, there are also some disadvantages to consider. For example, some people might be like, ""Uh, I don't know if I want to be in school for three years instead of four. That's a long time!""  And, like, some teachers might be worried about how it would affect their jobs and stuff. I mean, they're like, invested in us and everything, and they might not want to see their jobs change. 

And, you know, there are other factors that could have a significant role in the decision to pursue a three-year high school. Like, what if the school district couldn't afford it? Or what if it's not allowed by the state or something?  It's like, important to think about all the potential impacts, you know?

So, like, in conclusion, I think a three-year high school could be a good idea, but we need to think about all the pros and cons and stuff. And, like, it's not just about us students, it's about the teachers and the school district and everyone involved.  It's like, a big decision, but it could be really cool to explore and learn more about it.",1,llama2_chat,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that students should not be allowed to graduate high school a year early. While it may seem like a great idea to allow students to graduate early and move on to the next chapter of their lives, there are several reasons why this should not be the case.

First and foremost, graduating high school a year early can have a negative impact on a student's academic performance. High school is a time when students are expected to take challenging classes and complete complex assignments. When students are rushed to graduate, they may not have enough time to fully understand and master the material they need to succeed in college. This can lead to poor grades and a lack of preparedness for the next level of education.

Additionally, graduating high school a year early can also impact a student's social and emotional development. High school is a time when students are learning to navigate complex social situations and develop important life skills. When students graduate early, they may not have enough time to fully develop these skills and may struggle to adapt to the challenges of college and beyond.

Furthermore, graduating high school a year early can also impact a student's financial situation. College tuition and fees can be expensive, and students who graduate early may not have enough time to save up enough money to pay for their education. This can lead to financial stress and may force students to choose less expensive colleges or even drop out altogether.

In conclusion, graduating high school a year early may seem like a great idea, but it can have negative consequences for students' academic performance, social and emotional development, and financial situation. It is important for students to take their time and fully prepare for the next level of education, rather than rushing to graduate and move on to the next chapter of their lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about why using your imagination is super important, even though sometimes it might seem like knowledge is way more useful. 🤓

First of all, let's define what imagination is. It's like, the ability to think of new ideas or pictures in your head. It's like, when you're playing with Legos and you start building a castle, but then you're like, ""Wait, what if I made it a spaceship instead?"" 🚀 That's imagination! It's like, your brain's own little playground where you can come up with all sorts of cool stuff.

Now, you might be thinking, ""But why do I need imagination when I can just use knowledge to solve problems?"" Well, here's why. Knowledge is like, the facts and stuff you learn in school. It's important, don't get me wrong, but it's not always gonna help you come up with new ideas or solve problems in super creative ways. Like, if you're trying to design a new toy, you can use knowledge to learn about shapes and colors and stuff, but you need imagination to come up with something that's actually fun and interesting. 🎨

For example, let's say you're trying to come up with a new game to play with your friends. If you just use knowledge, you might come up with something like ""Hide and Seek"" or ""Tag"". But if you use your imagination, you could come up with something way cooler like ""Alien Invasion"" or ""Superhero Training Academy"". 🛸🦸‍♂️ See what I mean? Imagination can take you to some wild and amazing places!

Another reason imagination is important is because it helps you understand different perspectives. Like, if you're trying to understand why someone from a different culture does something different, you can use your imagination to put yourself in their shoes. It's like, you're not just learning about their culture, you're actually experiencing it. 🌎 It helps you be more empathetic and",1,llama2_chat,2
"Working in groups on school projects is a common practice that has been used by educators for years. While some people may argue that working alone is more effective, there are several benefits to working in groups that cannot be ignored. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of working with others, the ability to learn teamwork, and how working in a group can help produce better results.

One of the main benefits of working in groups is the ability to learn from others. When working with a group of people, each individual brings their own unique perspective and skills to the table. This allows for a more diverse and well-rounded approach to the project. By working with others, students can learn from their peers and gain a new perspective on the topic at hand. This can lead to a more creative and innovative solution to the problem.

Another advantage of working in groups is the ability to learn teamwork. In today's world, teamwork is a crucial skill that is highly valued in the workplace. Working in a group allows students to learn how to effectively communicate with others, delegate tasks, and work together to achieve a common goal. These are all valuable skills that will serve students well in the future.

Finally, working in a group can help produce better results. When working alone, it can be easy to become stuck in one's own ideas and to overlook important details. However, when working with a group, there are more people to bounce ideas off of and to provide feedback. This can lead to a more well-rounded and thoughtful solution to the problem. Additionally, working in a group can help to keep students motivated and on track. When working with others, students are more likely to feel a sense of accountability and to put in the effort needed to produce a high-quality result.

In conclusion, there are several benefits to working in groups on school projects. Working with others allows for a more diverse and well-rounded approach to the project, the ability to learn teamwork, and can help produce better results. While some people may argue that working alone is more effective, the benefits of working in groups cannot be ignored. As students, it is important to embrace the opportunity to work with others and to take advantage of the many benefits that it can bring.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey there! 

So, I guess I'm gonna write about how working hard, having confidence, and doing something can help us grow as people.  Like, it's pretty obvious, but I guess I gotta explain it anyway. 

So, first off, working hard is like, super important. When we put in effort and time into something, we're gonna get better at it. It's like, common sense, but it's true! Like, if I want to get good at playing the guitar, I gotta practice every day. If I don't, I'll never get better.  It's just how it is.

And confidence is also a big deal. When we believe in ourselves and our abilities, we're more likely to take risks and try new things. Like, if I don't think I can do something, I'm not gonna even try. But if I have confidence in myself, I might take the leap and give it a shot. And usually, I'll be surprised at how well I can do it! 

But here's the thing: doing nothing and expecting results is not gonna cut it.  Like, if I just sit around and do nothing, I'm not gonna get anywhere. I gotta be willing to put in the effort and take risks if I want to grow. It's like, if I want to run a marathon, I gotta train for it. I can't just sit on the couch and expect to be able to run 26 miles without any preparation. 

And the dangers of relying on doing nothing are, like, huge.  If we don't put in the effort, we're gonna stay stagnant and never reach our full potential.  It's like, if I don't practice my math problems, I'm gonna fail the test. It's just that simple.

So, in conclusion, working hard, having confidence, and doing something are all important ways we can grow as people. And relying on doing nothing is just not g",1,llama2_chat,0

An example of this is Pique, who tried different sports, activities, and experiences to diversify their skill set and expand their potential. This has contributed to their personal growth and improved their abilities both on and off the field. 

On the other hand, there are players like Lionel Messi that specialize in what they have mastered and still achieve success. However, while both scenarios have yielded successful results, there is a greater benefit associated with trying different things and expanding one's scope. It allows a person to reach greater heights of achievement and avoid stagnation by exploring new ideas, and this is why people must try different things to grow as a person.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that allowing students to bring cell phones to school has both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, cell phones can be useful tools for learning and staying organized, but on the other hand, they can also be a source of distraction and potential safety hazards.

One of the main advantages of allowing students to bring cell phones to school is that they can be used as a tool for learning. For example, students can use their cell phones to access educational apps or online resources that can help them learn new concepts or practice skills. Additionally, cell phones can be used to communicate with teachers and classmates, which can be helpful for staying organized and on top of assignments.

However, there are also several potential disadvantages to allowing students to bring cell phones to school. One concern is that cell phones can be a source of distraction in the classroom. For example, students may use their cell phones to text or browse social media instead of paying attention to the teacher or class material. This can disrupt the learning environment and make it harder for other students to focus.

Another potential disadvantage of allowing students to bring cell phones to school is that it can lead to overcrowding in hallways. With more students carrying cell phones, there may be more people in the hallways at the same time, which can make it harder for students to navigate and get to their classes on time.

Finally, there are potential safety hazards associated with allowing students to bring cell phones to school. For example, if a student is in an emergency situation, they may not be able to use their cell phone to call for help because it is not allowed in school. Additionally, if a student is using their cell phone while walking in the hallways, they may not be paying attention to their surroundings and could potentially get injured.

In conclusion, while there are certainly advantages to allowing students to bring cell phones to school, there are also potential disadvantages that need to be considered. As such, it is important for schools to carefully weigh the pros and cons of this policy and make a decision that is in the best interests of their students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"The Effects of Technology on People's Lives

Technology has had a profound impact on people's lives in the past few decades. It has allowed for faster and easier communication, access to information, and the ability to make plans and organize our lives. However, it has also had negative effects on our social lives, financial lives, and access to different resources.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is the ability to communicate with others. With the rise of social media, texting, and video calls, we can now easily connect with people all over the world. This has allowed for the formation of online communities and the ability to maintain relationships with friends and family who are far away. Technology has also made it easier to plan and organize our lives. With apps and tools that allow us to schedule appointments, set reminders, and manage our to-do lists, we can stay on top of our tasks and responsibilities.

However, technology has also had negative effects on our lives. One of the most significant concerns is the impact on our social lives. While technology has allowed us to connect with others, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions. People are now more likely to communicate with others through screens rather than in person, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Additionally, technology has had a negative impact on our financial lives. With the rise of online shopping and the ability to purchase goods and services with just a few clicks, people are now more likely to overspend and accrue debt.

Technology has also impacted our access to different resources. With the rise of the internet, we now have access to a wealth of information on virtually any topic. This has allowed for greater knowledge and understanding of the world around us. However, it has also led to the spread of misinformation and fake news. This can be particularly dangerous in areas such as healthcare and politics, where accurate information is critical.

Finally, technology has implications for our relationships. While it has allowed us to connect with others, it has also led to a decline in privacy. With the use of social media and other online platforms, our personal information is now more accessible than ever before. This can be both a positive and negative effect, as it allows us to connect with others and share our experiences, but it also puts us at risk of identity theft and other forms of",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Thomas Jefferson was a prominent American statesman and Founding Father who is most famously remembered for writing the Declaration of Independence. He was a passionate believer in hard work and the value of individuals coming together to serve each other and their country. According to Jefferson, respect and collaboration are integral parts of any successful society.

These beliefs of Jefferson's still resonate today, especially in the modern workplace. As technology continues to advance and more people are relying on collaborative talents, it is essential to remember the lessons that Jefferson taught us about the need to work hard and treat others with respect. People of all backgrounds need to come together to ensure that we are able to effectively and efficiently solve any issues that arise. Of course, mutual respect is key to this endeavor.

The sentiments that Jefferson promoted are as relevant now as they've ever been. We must never forget the importance of values such as hard work and respect for each other.

"Growing up, my parents taught me to always stay humble and true to myself. This lesson has stayed with me my entire life and continues to shape my character. I have taken this humble nature and used it to help me keep my feet firmly on the ground in all of life's challenges. It helps me to stay self-aware and critically think through situations before acting rashly. 

However, I have also adopted traits from the people I admire most; traits that challenge me to push and take chances. This has helped me become more courageous, forceful, and passionate about my goals. While it may have been beneficial for me to take these on, I must be careful not to do so at the expense of my humble nature.

This brings me back to the idea of whether or not I truly have total control of my character. On the one hand, it feels as though I have fully embraced the traits my parents taught me and I am certainly making conscious decisions to adopt certain character traits from others. On the other hand, I can never truly know how my upbringing, environment, and even genetics have contributed to forming my character. All I know is that no matter what, I will continue to strive to be the best version of myself.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey, ya'll!  Today, we're gonna talk about this dope essay prompt.  I know, I know, it's a big ask, but trust me, it's worth it. 😅

So, Ralph Waldo Emerson said this awesome thing: ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" And, man, I gotta agree.  Like, think about it. When you're playing your favorite video game, you gotta keep leveling up, right? You can't just stay at level 5 forever. You gotta keep pushing yourself, learning new moves, and taking on harder challenges. Otherwise, you'll get bored and lose interest. 😴

But it's not just video games.  Learning new things in school, making new friends, trying out for the basketball team – all of these things require you to step outside of your comfort zone. You gotta be willing to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from 'em. 

Now, I know it's not always easy. Sometimes, it feels like we're stuck in this never-ending cycle of school and homework and extracurriculars.  But, like, the more we challenge ourselves, the more we grow.  I mean, think about it. When you first started playing the piano, it was probably really hard, right?

"Self-reliance is an essential human characteristic that is both necessary and beneficial. It is the ability to make decisions and cope with the consequences, both good and bad, in order to achieve a certain goal. It cultivates a sense of independence and autonomy that is necessary for growth and personal development. 

In real life, self-reliance can be seen as a problem-solving tool when faced with various obstacles. For example, a student who is struggling to write a difficult essay may need to rely on themselves in order to overcome the challenge. Seeking help and guidance from others can be helpful, but it is ultimately up to the student to make the final decisions and take the necessary steps to reach success. 

The same applies to nature, where animals and plants must use self-reliance to survive in their ever-changing environment. They must navigate their surroundings, make decisions, and weather the consequences in order to secure resources and thrive. 

The thought process behind self-reliance is personal and divergent. It requires the individual to assess the situation, consider potential options, and weigh the pros and cons of each decision before making a final choice. The decisions we make can have a considerable impact on the outcome, so it is important to consider all the consequences and think logically before we act. 

In conclusion, self-reliance is an incredibly valuable trait that is both necessary and beneficial. It is impossible to progress without the ability to make informed decisions and face the consequences alone. Ultimately, self-reliance is the key to personal growth and success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys, I know it's super easy to get discouraged when things don't go our way, but trust me, giving up is not the answer. Like, I know it's hard to keep trying when we're struggling in school or when we're not as good at something as our friends are. But honestly, it's so important to keep pushing through and not give up.

First of all, when we give up, we're basically telling ourselves that we're not good enough. And that's just not true. I mean, think about it. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and just because we might not be as good at something as someone else doesn't mean we're not good at anything. So, if we give up, we're basically saying that we're not worth anything. And that's just not true.

And also, when we keep trying, we're showing ourselves that we're persistent and determined. And those are like, super important qualities to have. Like, think about it. If we give up on something we really want, like a sports team or a project, we're basically saying that we're not willing to put in the effort to achieve our goals. And that's not cool. But if we keep trying, even when it's hard, we're showing ourselves and everyone else that we're willing to put in the work to achieve our dreams.

And finally, when we don't give up, we're more likely to succeed. Like, think about it. If we give up on something, we're never gonna know if we could have done it if we kept trying. But if we keep pushing through, even when it's hard, we're more likely to achieve our goals. And that's like, the best feeling in the world.

So, in conclusion, giving up is not the answer. If we keep trying, we're showing ourselves and everyone else that we're persistent and determined, and we're more likely to succeed. So, let's all try our best and not give up, okay? Thanks for reading, guys!",1,llama2_chat,1

"Attending school is the traditional way for students to further their education, but with advancements in technology, distance learning and “school at home” programs are becoming increasingly popular. These programs allow students to keep up with their studies without leaving the comfort of their homes, but there are several pros and cons to consider regarding each option.

One of the main benefits to traditional school is the development of social skills. Students gain valuable life experiences from meeting and interacting with other classmates. They also learn to work together to complete group projects, develop communication skills, and gain essential life lessons. At home, these opportunities do not always present themselves as easily, and a student’s overall development of skills may be affected.

The traditional school system also prepares students for their adult lives. Schools offer resources such as guidance counselors, college prep classes, and résumé and job skills workshops. Students gain technical information from lectures and textbooks, but the one-on-one interaction and collaboration are what truly prepares them for the real world.

For students that are motivated, organized, and independent learners, “school at home” or distance learning programs are a great option, but it is not the right fit for everyone. Traditional school provides the social interaction, resources, and individualizing instruction that is essential for helping children grow into successful, confident adults. It is for this reason that traditional school remains a better option than ""school at home"" or distance learning for students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that self-esteem is one of the most important aspects of a person's life. It's the foundation upon which we build our self-confidence, our relationships, and our overall well-being. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of self-esteem and the various ways in which it can be attained.

First and foremost, respect is a crucial component of self-esteem. Respecting oneself means valuing one's own worth and recognizing that everyone has their own unique strengths and abilities. It's important to treat ourselves with kindness and compassion, just as we would treat a close friend. This means being gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes, and not letting our failures define us. It also means being proud of our accomplishments, no matter how small they may be.

In addition to respect, effort is another key factor in building self-esteem. When we put in hard work and dedication towards our goals, we feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in ourselves. This can come in many different forms, whether it's getting good grades, completing a project, or simply working towards a personal goal. By consistently striving to do our best and pushing ourselves to be better, we can develop a strong sense of self-efficacy and self-worth.

Behavior is also an important aspect of self-esteem. Our behavior can have a significant impact on how we feel about ourselves, and it's important to strive for positive behavior patterns. This means treating others with kindness and respect, being honest and authentic, and taking responsibility for our actions. It also means being mindful of our thoughts and emotions, and not letting negative self-talk hold us back.

Finally, education plays a crucial role in building self-esteem. By gaining knowledge and skills, we can feel more confident in our abilities and more capable of achieving our goals. Education also provides us with a sense of purpose and direction, which can be incredibly empowering. Whether it's pursuing a hobby or passion, or simply working towards a high school diploma, education can help us develop a strong sense of self-worth and self-esteem.

In conclusion, self-esteem is an essential aspect of our lives, and there are many different ways in which it can be attained",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Dear [Teacher],

I am writing to argue that the school day should not be extended by an extra hour. While some may argue that an extra hour would provide more time for students to learn and study, I believe that this would not necessarily be the case. In fact, an extended school day could have several negative consequences for students, including decreased productivity, increased stress, and a lack of balance in their lives.

First, an extended school day could lead to decreased productivity among students. While it may seem like an extra hour would give students more time to learn and study, research has shown that students' cognitive abilities peak in the morning and early afternoon. After a certain point, their productivity begins to decline, and an extra hour in the afternoon or evening may not be enough to make up for this decline. In fact, studies have shown that students who attend school for longer hours tend to have lower grades and test scores than those who attend school for the standard length.

Second, an extended school day could lead to increased stress among students. Many students already struggle with stress and anxiety, and an extra hour of school could exacerbate these feelings. Students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to complete, or they may worry about keeping up with their peers. This stress could lead to decreased mental health and well-being, which would be detrimental to their overall academic success.

Finally, an extended school day could lead to a lack of balance in students' lives. Many students already have a lot of responsibilities outside of school, such as sports, clubs, and family obligations. An extra hour of school could make it difficult for students to balance these responsibilities with their academic work. This lack of balance could lead to burnout and decreased engagement in school, which would be detrimental to their academic success.

In conclusion, while an extended school day may seem like a good idea on the surface, I believe that it would have several negative consequences for students. Decreased productivity, increased stress, and a lack of balance in their lives are just a few of the potential drawbacks of an extended school day. Instead of extending the school day, I believe that schools should focus on providing students with the resources and support they need to succeed academically and personally.

Sincerely,

"In today's world, it is not uncommon to hear about people being treated with kindness and respect in some countries, while in others, they are subjected to cruelty and disrespect. The prevalence of this issue varies across different countries, and it can have a significant impact on an individual's psychological, emotional, and day-to-day life.

In some countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, people are generally treated with kindness and respect. These countries have strong laws and regulations that protect human rights and promote equality. However, even in these countries, there are still instances of discrimination and mistreatment, which can have a lasting impact on an individual's mental and emotional well-being.

On the other hand, in some countries, such as North Korea, Iran, and China, people are often subjected to harsh and disrespectful treatment. These countries have strict social norms and laws that can be difficult to navigate, and individuals who do not conform to these norms may face discrimination and mistreatment. This can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety, which can have a negative impact on an individual's mental and emotional health.

In addition to the psychological and emotional impact of mistreatment, it can also have a significant impact on an individual's day-to-day life. For example, people who are subjected to discrimination and mistreatment may struggle to find employment or housing, which can make it difficult to meet their basic needs. They may also face health issues due to stress and other mental health problems.

However, treating others with kindness and respect can have a positive impact on an individual's life in the long run. When people feel valued and respected, they are more likely to feel confident and self-assured. This can lead to better mental and emotional health, as well as better relationships with others. In addition, people who are treated with kindness and respect are more likely to be productive and contribute positively to their communities.

In conclusion, the prevalence of people not being treated with kindness or respect varies across different countries around the world. The impact of this can be significant, both psychologically and emotionally, as well as in an individual's day-to-day life. However, treating others with kindness and respect can have a positive impact on an individual's life in the long run. It is",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Failure: The Unspoken Key to Success

As an 8th grader, I've encountered my fair share of failures. From forgetting my homework to bombing a math test, failure has become a constant companion in my life. But is failure truly necessary to achieve success? In my opinion, the answer is a resounding yes.

On one hand, failure can be a blessing in disguise. When we fail, we learn from our mistakes and become better equipped to handle challenges in the future. For instance, I once tried out for the school play and didn't get the lead role. At first, I was devastated, but my drama teacher told me that I had the potential to be a great actor, just not in that particular production. With that feedback, I practiced harder and landed a smaller but still important role in the next play. Without that initial failure, I might not have pushed myself to improve.

Moreover, failure can increase our enthusiasm and drive to succeed. When we encounter obstacles, it's easy to become discouraged and lose motivation. But if we view failure as a learning opportunity, we're more likely to stay engaged and motivated. For example, I recently failed a science test, but instead of getting frustrated, I studied harder and improved my understanding of the material. Now, I'm more excited than ever to learn and excel in science.

On the other hand, too much failure can lead to a lack of enthusiasm and a fear of taking risks. When we experience failure repeatedly, it can erode our confidence and make us feel like we'll never succeed. For instance, my friend used to love playing soccer, but after getting cut from the school team, she lost interest in the sport altogether. While it's important to learn from our failures, it's equally important to recognize when we need to take a break and recharge.

In conclusion, failure is a necessary part of life and can actually increase our enthusiasm to succeed. While too much failure can lead to a lack of motivation, the right mindset can turn failure into a valuable learning experience. So, the next time you encounter failure, embrace it as an opportunity to grow and improve. As the saying goes, ""Success is not final, failure is",1,llama2_chat,1
"Working in a group is like, super beneficial, you know? Like, it's like, you get to share ideas and stuff, and find different information that you might not have thought of on your own. And if someone gets sick or something, you can just pick up where they left off, you know? It's like, way easier than trying to do everything yourself.

Like, for example, when we did that project on ancient civilizations in history class. I was like, totally stuck on this one part, and my groupmates were like, ""Hey, man, we can help you with that!"" And they showed me this cool website with like, super detailed info on the pyramids. I never would have found that on my own, you know?

And it's not just about finding new information, it's also about getting more support from the group. Like, if you're working on something and you're not sure how to do it, you can ask your groupmates for help. They might have a better way of doing it, or they might know something you don't.

"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to be aware of the career options available to us and the methods of curbing drug, alcohol, and gang-related problems in teenagers. In this essay, I will discuss both of these topics and provide my opinion on the best course of action.

Firstly, let's talk about career options. High school students have a wide range of options available to them, from traditional four-year colleges to vocational schools and apprenticeships. Each of these options has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, attending a four-year college can provide a well-rounded education and lead to a high-paying job, but it can also be expensive and take a long time to complete. On the other hand, vocational schools and apprenticeships can provide students with practical skills and a chance to start working in their field right away, but they may not lead to as many job opportunities as a four-year degree.

In my opinion, the best course of action for high school students is to explore all of their options and make an informed decision based on their interests, skills, and financial situation. Students should consider factors such as the cost of tuition, the length of the program, and the job opportunities available in their field. They should also speak with guidance counselors and employers to get a better understanding of the job market and the skills and qualifications required for different careers.

Now, let's talk about methods of curbing drug, alcohol, and gang-related problems in teenagers. These issues are prevalent in many communities and can have serious consequences for individuals and society as a whole. There are several methods that can be used to address these problems, including education, law enforcement, and community-based programs.

Education is an important tool in preventing drug, alcohol, and gang-related problems. Students should be taught about the risks and consequences of these behaviors, as well as strategies for coping with peer pressure and making healthy choices. Schools can also provide resources and support for students who are struggling with these issues, such as counseling and mentoring programs.

Law enforcement can also play a role in addressing these problems, but it should be used in conjunction with other methods. Punitive measures alone, such as harsh penalties and incarceration, may not be effective in preventing drug,",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

Distance Learning: Pros and Cons

Distance learning is a form of education where students learn through online classes instead of traditional in-person classes. With the rise of technology, distance learning has become more accessible and popular among students. However, like any other educational method, it has its pros and cons.

One of the main advantages of distance learning is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or extra responsibilities after school. For example, students who play sports or have part-time jobs may find it difficult to attend classes during regular school hours. With distance learning, they can complete their coursework on their own time, which can help them balance their responsibilities and academic work.

Another advantage of distance learning is cost-effectiveness. Traditional classes often require students to purchase textbooks, transportation, and other materials, which can be expensive. With distance learning, students can access course materials online, which can save them money. Additionally, some schools offer free or low-cost courses, which can make education more accessible to students who may not have the financial means to attend traditional classes.

However, distance learning also has its disadvantages. One of the main concerns is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. Students may find it difficult to ask questions or get help when they need it, which can negatively impact their learning experience. Additionally, students may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers, which can lead to a lack of social interaction and community building.

Bullying in Schools

Bullying is a serious problem in schools that can have long-lasting effects on students' mental health and academic performance. According to a recent study, over 20% of students in the United States have been bullied at school. Bullying can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and cyberbullying.

To address the problem of bullying, schools can implement anti-bullying programs that promote empathy and respect for others. These programs can include workshops, assemblies, and peer mentoring. Additionally, schools can create safe spaces for students to talk about their experiences and receive support.

"Working with a group on school assignments can be beneficial for students, as it can help them learn new skills, find solutions to problems, and break down complicated concepts. On the other hand, working alone can have its own advantages, such as allowing students to work at their own pace and ensuring that they get full credit for their work. 

Ultimately, both approaches have their pros and cons, and students should decide which approach works best for them. In particular, working with a group can be a great choice for students because it allows for collaboration and shared responsibility among team members. Not only can this make the project more manageable and enjoyable, but it can also help foster teamwork and problem-solving skills essential for success in the future. Moreover, working with a group can also give students access to a greater range of perspectives, allowing each member to learn from one another’s ideas and abilities. For these reasons, students should consider voting to work in a group on school assignments.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

"cultivate a positive attitude and provide examples of how it can improve one's life.

The benefits of having a positive attitude are numerous and can greatly enhance one's overall well-being. Firstly, a positive attitude can lead to improved mental health. Studies have shown that people with a positive outlook tend to have a lower incidence of depression and anxiety. This is likely due to the fact that a positive attitude allows individuals to focus on the good things in their lives, rather than dwelling on negative thoughts and emotions.

Secondly, a positive attitude can improve one's relationships with others. People who have a positive outlook tend to be more approachable and likable, which can lead to stronger connections with friends and family. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals navigate difficult situations with others, such as conflicts or disagreements, in a more effective and productive manner.

Thirdly, a positive attitude can increase productivity and motivation. When individuals have a positive outlook, they tend to be more motivated to achieve their goals and are more likely to persist in the face of challenges. This can lead to increased productivity and success in both personal and professional settings.

Finally, a positive attitude can contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Studies have shown that people with a positive outlook tend to make better health choices, such as eating a healthier diet and engaging in regular exercise. This can lead to a lower risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, and an overall healthier and longer life.

Successful people tend to have a positive outlook on life, which can greatly contribute to their success. They view challenges and obstacles as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as insurmountable obstacles. This mindset allows them to approach problems with a sense of optimism and resilience, which can lead to greater success in their personal and professional lives.

Cultivating a positive attitude can be done through a variety of methods. One way is to focus on the good things in one's life and to practice gratitude. This can involve keeping a gratitude journal, expressing thanks to others, or simply taking time to reflect on the positive aspects of one's life. Additionally, practicing mindfulness and self-care, such as meditation or exercise, can help individuals develop a more positive outlook and improve their overall well-being.

"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about how a positive attitude can lead to a successful life. I mean, let's be real, who doesn't want to be successful and happy, right? Like, I know I do! 😃

So, let's start with some examples of successful people who have a positive attitude. Like, have you heard of Steve Jobs? He was like totally obsessed with innovation and creating something new, and it paid off big time. He's like a billionaire now, and he's still changing the world with his tech company, Apple. 💡 And then there's J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter. She was like super determined to get her books published, even when everyone kept rejecting her. And now she's like a household name and her books are like, totes popular! 📚

But it's not just about being determined, it's also about having a positive attitude. Like, when things get tough, you gotta keep on going and not give up. And that's where risk-taking comes in. If you're always taking risks and trying new things, you're more likely to achieve your goals. It's like, if you don't take risks, you'll never know what could've been. 💥

And speaking of happiness, having a positive attitude can bring so much joy to your life. When you're positive and optimistic, you're more likely to see the good in things and people.

"One way to meet new people without speaking is through body language and nonverbal cues. When you enter a room, look around and make eye contact with the people in the room. Smile and nod your head or wave at people you’d like to get to know better. It’s also easy to tell when someone wants to stay to themselves or wants to talk. If someone is open to conversation, approach them slowly and calmly, introducing yourself with a few details about your life and/or interests.

Having a pet is another great way to meet new people without having to say much. Animal lovers are naturally drawn to animals, so if you have a pet, it’s likely you will have conversations with those who are also drawn to your pet. If you don’t have a pet, you can still try to make friends with people who have one – consider taking your pet for a walk around your neighborhood and striking up a conversation with the other pet owners.

Of course, as with any situation, there are potential positive and negative scenarios associated with meeting new people. On the positive side, you could make new friends, find a new job, or even form a meaningful relationship. On the negative side, you could experience bullying or rejection. As long as you stay open to the possibilities, however, and use your best judgment, the potential positives far outweigh the target negatives.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"The implementation of a program designed to teach children about respect and empathy can have significant benefits for both younger and older students. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that this program can help me in many ways, especially when I have kids of my own.

Firstly, the program can help me develop a better understanding of how to treat others with respect and empathy. As a younger student, I may not have had much experience interacting with people from different backgrounds or with different abilities. However, as I grow older and have kids of my own, I will need to be able to treat them with the same respect and empathy that I want them to receive. The program can help me develop these skills and make me a better parent.

Secondly, the program can help me prepare for the challenges of parenting. As a younger student, I may not have much experience with the responsibilities that come with being a parent. However, by learning about respect and empathy, I can better understand how to communicate with my children and how to treat them with the kindness and compassion that they deserve. This can help me become a better parent and a better person overall.

Finally, the program can help me develop a greater sense of respect for others, regardless of age. As a younger student, I may not have had much experience interacting with people from different generations or with different life experiences. However, by learning about respect and empathy, I can better understand how to communicate with people from all walks of life. This can help me develop a greater sense of respect for others and make me a more well-rounded person.

In conclusion, I believe that the implementation of a program designed to teach children about respect and empathy can have significant benefits for both younger and older students. As an eighth-grade student, I am excited to learn more about these skills and how they can help me in many ways, especially when I have kids of my own.

"Winston Churchill, a renowned British Prime Minister, once said, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" This statement is incredibly inspirational and speaks to the resilience and determination that is necessary to achieve success in life. In this essay, I will analyze the meaning of this statement and provide examples from Churchill's life where he embodied this principle.

Firstly, it is important to understand the meaning behind Churchill's statement. Success, in this context, is not measured solely by achievements or accomplishments, but by the ability to persevere through setbacks and failures. Enthusiasm, on the other hand, refers to a positive attitude and a willingness to continue even in the face of adversity. By combining these two concepts, Churchill is suggesting that true success comes from maintaining a positive mindset and continuing to work towards one's goals, even when those goals seem unattainable.

One example of Churchill embodying this principle can be seen during his early years as a politician. Churchill faced numerous failures in his political career, including losing several elections and being ousted from leadership positions. Despite these setbacks, Churchill remained committed to his beliefs and continued to pursue his goals with unwavering enthusiasm. This perseverance ultimately paid off, as Churchill went on to become one of the most successful and influential leaders in British history.

Another example of Churchill's resilience can be seen during World War II. As the leader of Britain during one of the darkest periods in its history, Churchill faced immense pressure and criticism from both his own people and the world at large. Despite these challenges, Churchill remained steadfast in his determination to lead Britain through the war and emerge victorious. His unwavering enthusiasm and commitment to the cause inspired the British people and helped to keep morale high during a time of great hardship.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's statement ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a powerful reminder of the importance of resilience and determination in achieving success. By maintaining a positive mindset and continuing to work towards one's goals, even in the face of adversity, individuals can overcome setbacks and ultimately achieve their dreams. Churchill's own life serves as a testament to the power of this principle, and his legacy continues to inspire people around the world",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, but with a condition of using them outside of class. In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it is only natural for students to want to have access to their phones during school hours. However, I understand the concerns of teachers and administrators who worry about the potential distractions that phones can cause in the classroom. In this essay, I will discuss how teachers can prevent students from distracting the class and the precautions students can take to avoid having their phones taken away.

One way that teachers can prevent students from distracting the class is by setting clear rules and expectations for phone use. Teachers can establish a ""no phones in class"" policy, which means that students are not allowed to use their phones during class time. This policy can be enforced by having students turn off their phones or put them in silent mode when they enter the classroom. Teachers can also use apps or software that can detect when a student's phone is on and automatically mute it.

Another way that teachers can prevent students from distracting the class is by providing alternative activities that are engaging and interactive. For example, teachers can use educational games or videos that are designed to teach students new concepts or reinforce existing knowledge. By providing students with these types of activities, teachers can help to keep students focused and engaged, and reduce the likelihood of distractions caused by phones.

Students can also take precautions to avoid having their phones taken away. For example, they can put their phones in a locked bag or case when they enter the classroom. This will prevent their phones from being easily accessible to other students or teachers, and reduce the likelihood of them being stolen or damaged. Students can also set their phones to silent mode or turn them off when they enter the classroom, to avoid any distractions.

In conclusion, I believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, but with a condition of using them outside of class. Teachers can prevent students from distracting the class by setting clear rules and expectations for phone use, providing alternative activities that are engaging and interactive, and by using apps or software that can detect when a student's phone is on and automatically mute it.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Making a career decision upon entering high school can be both beneficial and limiting. On one hand, it can give students a clear direction and goal to work towards, allowing them to focus their efforts and make the most of their high school experience. For example, if a student knows they want to be a doctor, they can take advanced science and math classes, join medical clubs, and volunteer at hospitals to gain valuable experience. This can help them get into a good college and eventually land a job in their desired field.

On the other hand, making a career decision too early can be limiting. High school is a time of exploration and discovery, and students should be allowed to try out different activities and interests without feeling pressured to commit to one path. If a student is forced to choose a career too early, they may miss out on opportunities to explore other passions and talents. Additionally, careers are not set in stone, and students may change their minds multiple times throughout their lives. By not making a decision too early, students can have the freedom to explore different options and find the career that truly makes them happy.

Another limitation of making a career decision too early is that students may not have the necessary information and experience to make an informed decision. Many careers require years of education and training, and students may not be aware of the requirements and opportunities in their chosen field. By not making a decision too early, students can take the time to research and learn about different careers, giving them a better understanding of what they want to do.

In conclusion, while making a career decision upon entering high school can have its benefits, it can also be limiting. Students should be allowed to explore their interests and passions without feeling pressured to commit to one path too early. By taking the time to research and learn about different careers, students can make an informed decision that sets them up for success in the long run.",1,llama2_chat,4
"Ugh, I can't believe I have to write another essay. But here it goes.

So, I think that music, drama, and art classes should be electives and not required. I know some people might say that these classes are important for kids to develop their creativity and stuff, but I don't think so.

First of all, music classes are just a waste of time. I mean, who's gonna listen to our terrible singing and playing? It's not like we're gonna be rockstars or anything. And don't even get me started on drama. I mean, who wants to act like a bunch of weirdos on stage? It's just not my thing. And art? Forget about it. I can't even draw a straight line. It's just not worth it.

And it's not fair to everyone. Some kids might actually be good at these things and enjoy them, but most of us aren't. So why force us to take these classes and pretend to be something we're not? It's just not fair to the kids who are actually talented and could be doing something they love, but instead they're stuck in a class with a bunch of people who can't even carry a tune.

And it's not important either. I mean, how many times are we gonna be graded on our ability to play the recorder or paint a picture? It's not like these skills are gonna help us in real life. I'd rather learn something useful like math or science. At least then I could use it to get a good job and make some money.

So yeah, I think music, drama, and art classes should be electives. It's just not worth it.

Sincerely,
An Average 8th Grader",1,llama2_chat,2
"Making a good first impression is crucial in many aspects of life, including personal relationships, job interviews, and even everyday interactions. It is the initial perception that people have of you, and it can greatly influence the way they interact with you in the future.

One of the main reasons why making a good first impression is important is because people cannot go back in time. Once a first impression is made, it cannot be undone. This means that if you make a negative first impression, it can be difficult to change people's perceptions of you. For example, if you are interviewing for a job and you come across as unprofessional or disinterested, the interviewer may not see you as a good fit for the position, even if you have the qualifications and experience.

Another reason why making a good first impression is important is because it can lead to lost opportunities. If people have a negative perception of you, they may not be as likely to give you opportunities in the future. For example, if you are in a social setting and you come across as rude or insincere, people may not want to interact with you again, which can limit your social circle and opportunities for making new friends.

Finally, making a bad first impression can also lead to trouble. If people perceive you as untrustworthy or unreliable, they may be less likely to give you their time or resources. For example, if you are in a job and you consistently miss deadlines or fail to follow through on commitments, your boss may start to lose faith in you, which can lead to disciplinary action or even termination.

In conclusion, making a good first impression is crucial in many aspects of life. It can greatly influence the way people interact with you in the future, and it can lead to lost opportunities and even trouble if not done correctly. It is important to be aware of the way you present yourself and to make a conscious effort to make a positive first impression, whether it's in a job interview, a social setting, or any other situation.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Dear [Student],

As an eighth-grade student, you may be starting to think about your future career path. It's important to choose a career that aligns with your interests and knowledge, as this will help you find fulfillment and success in your professional life. In this essay, I will research possible career paths that align with your interests and knowledge, discuss the pros and cons of different career paths, share advice regarding gaining experience in the workplace, explain the importance of work ethic and how to address your boss, outline the potential benefits of gaining experience and knowledge from an internship, and help you find a job or career path that interests you and will help you.

First, let's discuss possible career paths that align with your interests and knowledge. Based on your interests and knowledge, I have researched several potential career paths that you may find fulfilling. These include:

1. Graphic Designer
2. Software Developer
3. Environmental Scientist
4. Biomedical Engineer
5. Journalist

Each of these career paths requires different skills and knowledge, but they all align with your interests and knowledge. For example, if you have a passion for art and design, a career as a Graphic Designer may be a good fit. If you have a strong background in math and science, a career as an Environmental Scientist or Biomedical Engineer may be a good choice.

Now, let's discuss the pros and cons of different career paths. Each career path has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. For example, a career as a Graphic Designer may offer a creative and flexible work environment, but it may also require long hours and a lot of self-motivation. A career as a Software Developer may offer a high salary and job security, but it may also require a lot of technical skills and constant learning.

When choosing a career path, it's important to weigh the pros and cons and choose the one that aligns with your values and goals. It's also important to consider the job market and the demand for your chosen career path.

Moving on to gaining experience in the workplace, it's crucial to gain experience in your chosen field as early as possible. This can be done through internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer work. Gaining experience in the workplace will help you",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Hey, Mrs. Smith! Here's my essay on the idea of first impressions and how they can or cannot be changed, using personal experience and examples from both humans and animals.

First impressions are super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new and they're all like, ""Hi, I'm Sarah!"" and you're like, ""Hey, nice to meet you!"" And then you start talking and you're like, ""Wow, this person is really cool!"" But then, like, a few minutes later, they do something that's like, totally not cool, and you're like, ""Uh, I don't know if I like you anymore.""

But, like, sometimes first impressions can be wrong, you know? Like, I met this guy once and he was all like, ""Hey, man, I'm super chill and funny!"" And I was like, ""Yeah, okay, cool!"" But then we started talking and he was like, totally different. He was actually really nice and funny, but I was like, ""Uh, I don't know if I want to hang out with you anymore.""

And it's not just people, either. Like, have you ever seen those animal documentaries where they show how animals can be like, totally different from what you think they are? Like, this one time I saw a video of a snake that was all like, ""Hey, I'm not gonna bite you, dude!"" And I was like, ""Whoa, that's so cool!"" But then it turned out that it was just pretending to be nice so it could, like, sneak up on its prey or something.

So, like, first impressions aren't always right, you know? It's important to give people and animals a chance to show you who they really are, instead of just judging them based on how they look or act at first. Because, like, you never know, they might surprise you!

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you like it! Let me know if you have any questions or need me to, like, clarify anything. Thanks, Mrs. Smith!",1,llama2_chat,1
"The debate as to whether people choose their own character traits or are shaped by outside influences has raged on for centuries. On the one hand, many people believe that individual character is predetermined and largely shaped by factors such as family upbringing, education, economic status, and other societal influences. On the other hand, those who hold that people can choose their own character traits point to free will and personal choice as the deciding factors. 

Regardless of which side of the debate you end up on, one thing is certain: the interplay between the environment and the individual is complex and shaped by a multitude of factors. Genetics, family, society, and culture are all powerful factors in shaping a person's character, and some researchers have taken these factors into account in their studies. However, it is also true that people can make conscious choices that affect the development of their character; therefore, choice also plays a role in the overall formation of one's character. 

At the end of the day, whether people choose their own character traits or they are shaped by external influences is a complex question with no definitive answer. Research has shown that both factors play a part in the development of character, and only by taking into account both environmental and individual factors can we fully understand the role each plays.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that the implementation of policy one, allowing students to have cell phones, would greatly benefit the school system and its students. In today's world, cell phones have become an essential tool for communication and organization, and denying students access to them during school hours can hinder their ability to learn and succeed.

Firstly, cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are used for communication, research, and organization. By allowing students to have their cell phones during school hours, they can easily communicate with their teachers and classmates, research information for assignments, and stay organized with their schedules and assignments. This would allow students to be more engaged and focused in class, as they would not have to worry about missing important messages or forgetting assignments.

Secondly, cell phones can also be used as a tool for learning. Many educational apps and resources are available on cell phones that can help students enhance their learning experience. For example, language learning apps, math games, and educational videos can be accessed on cell phones, allowing students to continue learning even outside of the classroom. This would allow students to be more well-rounded and better prepared for the future.

Finally, allowing students to have cell phones during school hours would also promote responsibility and independence. By having access to their own devices, students would learn to manage their time effectively and prioritize their tasks. This would also teach students the importance of responsible technology use, as they would learn to use their devices in a way that is respectful and appropriate for the school environment.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the implementation of policy one, allowing students to have cell phones, would greatly benefit the school system and its students. By allowing students to have access to their own devices, they can be more engaged, focused, and well-rounded learners. This would also promote responsibility and independence, as students learn to manage their time effectively and prioritize their tasks. I urge the school board to consider implementing this policy and allow students to have cell phones during school hours.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student against extending the school day:

Ugh, do we really have to talk about this? I know some people think it's a good idea to extend the school day, but I'm here to tell you why it's not. First of all, let's be real, it's already super long. I mean, I know some schools go until like 4 or 5 pm, but that's just ridiculous. I'm already exhausted by the end of the day, and adding more time to it is just going to make me even more tired.

And don't even get me started on how it limits my free time. I mean, I already have to do homework and stuff after school, but if we have to stay longer, I won't have any time left to do the things I actually want to do. Like, I love playing video games and hanging out with my friends, but if I have to be at school longer, I won't be able to do any of that. It's just not fair.

And let's not forget about how extending the school day makes me hate school even more. I already don't love being there, but if we have to stay longer, it's just going to make me even more miserable. I'll be like, ""Ugh, do I have to be here again tomorrow? Can't we just be done already?"" It's not a good environment to be in, and it's not going to make me learn anything better.

I know some people might say, ""But it will help you learn more!"" But honestly, I don't think so. I mean, I already learn enough during the school day, and adding more time isn't going to make a difference. It's like, I get it, you want me to learn more, but there's only so much you can cram into one day. It's not like I'm going to magically become smarter if we stay in school longer.

So, yeah, I'm definitely against extending the school day. It's just not worth it. I'd much rather have a shorter day and have some time to myself after school.",1,llama2_chat,0
"Asking for advice is a common occurrence in our daily lives, whether it be from a friend, family member, or even a stranger. While it may seem easier to just ask one person for advice, there are many benefits to seeking out multiple perspectives. In this essay, I will explore the various forms of advice people ask for, how multiple viewpoints can be beneficial, and how asking for advice can lead to learning something new and making new friends.

First, it's important to understand the different forms of advice that people seek. Some common examples include career advice, relationship advice, and financial advice. Career advice can come from a variety of sources, such as a mentor, a teacher, or even a stranger on the street. Relationship advice can come from friends, family members, or even a therapist. Financial advice can come from a financial advisor, a banker, or even a stranger on the internet.

While it may seem like asking one person for advice is enough, there are many benefits to seeking out multiple perspectives. One of the main benefits is that multiple viewpoints can provide a more well-rounded understanding of a situation. When you ask for advice from multiple people, you are able to consider different angles and perspectives that you may not have considered otherwise. This can lead to a more informed decision and a better outcome.

Another benefit of seeking out multiple perspectives is that it can lead to learning something new. When you ask for advice from someone with different experiences or expertise than your own, you can gain valuable insights and knowledge that you may not have had before. This can lead to personal growth and development, as well as a better understanding of the world around you.

Finally, asking for advice can lead to making new friends. When you ask for advice from someone, you are essentially asking them to invest time and energy into helping you. This can lead to a stronger bond and a deeper connection with that person. Additionally, when you ask for advice from someone, you are also opening yourself up to new perspectives and ideas that you may not have considered before. This can lead to new friendships and a broader network of people.

In conclusion, seeking out multiple perspectives when asking for advice has many benefits. By considering different angles and perspectives, you can gain a more well-rounded understanding of a situation. Additionally, asking for advice can lead to learning something new",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Enthusiasm is an important factor in achieving success in any field. It is the driving force behind motivation and the energy that fuels our actions. Enthusiasm is not just about being passionate about something, it's about having a positive attitude towards it. It's about being excited and eager to achieve our goals.

One of the most successful people in the world is Elon Musk. He is known for his enthusiasm and his ability to turn his ideas into reality. Musk's enthusiasm for science and technology has led him to create some of the most innovative companies in the world, including Tesla and SpaceX. His enthusiasm for space exploration has led him to develop rockets that can take humans to Mars and beyond.

Another example of the power of enthusiasm is the success of the Montessori method of education. Dr. Maria Montessori was a passionate advocate for the education of children, and her enthusiasm for her work led her to develop a unique approach to teaching that has helped millions of children around the world.

The enthusiasm of the employees of Apple Inc. is also a testament to the power of enthusiasm. Apple's employees are known for their passion for their work and their dedication to creating products that are innovative and user-friendly. This enthusiasm has helped Apple to become one of the most successful companies in the world.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is an important factor in achieving success. It is the driving force behind motivation and the energy that fuels our actions. The examples of Elon Musk, Dr. Maria Montessori, and Apple's employees show that enthusiasm can lead to success in any field. Whether it's in science and technology, education, or business, enthusiasm is the key to achieving our goals and making a positive impact on the world.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Physical Education (P.E) classes have been a staple of school life for many students, including Generic_Name. However, not all students enjoy P.E classes, but Generic_Name has a unique perspective on why he enjoys them. In this essay, I will analyze the reasons why Generic_Name enjoys P.E classes both inside and outside of school grounds, considering both physical and social aspects of P.E.

Firstly, P.E classes provide an opportunity for physical activity and exercise, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Generic_Name understands the importance of physical fitness and enjoys the feeling of being active during P.E classes. Physical activity can help improve cardiovascular health, build strength, and increase flexibility, all of which are crucial for overall health and well-being. Furthermore, P.E classes provide a safe and structured environment for students to engage in physical activity, which can be beneficial for those who may not have access to such opportunities outside of school.

Secondly, P.E classes provide an opportunity for social interaction and teamwork. During P.E classes, students are grouped into teams and work together to complete various activities. This provides an opportunity for students to develop communication skills, leadership skills, and teamwork skills, all of which are essential for success in many aspects of life. Furthermore, P.E classes provide an opportunity for students to interact with their peers and build relationships with others, which can be beneficial for mental health and overall well-being.

Lastly, P.E classes can have a positive impact on others. For example, when Generic_Name participates in P.E classes, he encourages his peers to participate and be active. This can inspire others to engage in physical activity outside of school, which can lead to a healthier and more active community. Additionally, P.E classes can provide an opportunity for students to learn about the importance of physical activity and its benefits, which can help spread awareness and encourage others to engage in physical activity.

In conclusion, Generic_Name enjoys P.E classes for a variety of reasons, including the physical and social aspects of the class. P.E classes provide an opportunity for physical activity and exercise, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, P.E classes provide an opportunity for social interaction and teamwork, which can be beneficial for mental health and overall well-being",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Summer break is an essential part of the academic calendar for many students and can offer a number of important benefits over having breaks throughout the year. Firstly, by having one break over a long period, students may be more likely to retain what they’ve learned prior to their break, without detrimental effects from repeated long breaks throughout the year. Additionally, having an extended period away from school gives students a much needed mental health break and time to reconnect with family and friends. 

Furthermore, having all breaks in a concentrated period allows students to focus on other activities such as part-time jobs, or internships to develop life skills and can help alleviate any pressures that may arise if they are trying to manage part-time work throughout the year alongside school. Finally, summer break can be used to revise and strengthen understanding of difficult topics that had been encountered during the year, allowing students to return to school feeling more prepared and more successful in their studies. 

In conclusion, having summer break as an extended break throughout the year is much more beneficial for students, both in terms of academic achievement and personal well-being.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"In recent years, cell phones have increasingly become part of the educational landscape. Educators are exploring ways to use cell phones as a learning tool in the classroom, as they can provide a great and convenient way to engage students in learning. Proponents of using cell phones in the classroom argue that cell phones can be used to access online educational resources, to aid in learning in real time, and to facilitate communication and collaboration among students. 

At the same time, there are some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. They can be distracting to students and take away from time that could be used for more traditional learning activities. Some research has also suggested that using cell phones in the classroom can lead to decreased classroom engagement and learning, as students are more likely to become distracted by texting and social media. 

In my opinion, using cell phones in the classroom can be beneficial as a supplement to traditional learning activities, provided that they are used properly and monitored appropriately by educators. Cell phones can provide an engaging and convenient way for students to acquire knowledge in a digital world, but ultimately the teacher needs to make sure that cell phone use does not disrupt the learning process.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. With the rise of technology, students now have the ability to attend classes online from the comfort of their own homes. While there are certainly advantages to this form of education, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits of attending classes online versus physically going to school.

One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the flexibility it offers. Students can attend classes from anywhere, as long as they have a reliable internet connection. This means that they can attend classes while working or traveling, or even while living in a different country. For example, a student who is studying abroad can still attend classes online and keep up with their studies, even if they cannot physically attend classes on campus.

Another advantage of distance learning is the ability to learn at one's own pace. In traditional classroom settings, students are often forced to move on to the next topic before they have fully understood it. With online classes, however, students can take as much time as they need to review and understand the material. This is especially helpful for students who struggle with certain concepts or who need extra practice.

Despite these advantages, there are also some disadvantages to attending classes online. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of social interaction. In traditional classroom settings, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a face-to-face basis. This can be especially important for developing social skills and building relationships with others. Without this interaction, students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is the potential for distractions. When students are attending classes online, they need to have a lot of self-discipline to avoid getting distracted by social media or other online activities. This can be difficult for some students, and they may not be as successful in their studies as they would be in a traditional classroom setting.

In conclusion, there are certainly advantages and disadvantages to attending classes online versus physically going to school. While distance learning offers flexibility and the ability to learn at one's own pace, it can also be isolating and distracting. Ultimately, the best form of education will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Working alone or in a group has its own unique advantages. While some people may argue that working in a group is always better, I believe that working alone has its own set of benefits that cannot be ignored. In this essay, I will explain three reasons why working alone can be beneficial and provide examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, working alone allows for greater focus and concentration. When you are working with a group, it can be easy to get distracted by the opinions and ideas of others. This can lead to a lack of focus on your own work and can result in a lower quality of work. On the other hand, when you are working alone, you have complete control over your environment and can focus solely on your work. For example, when studying for an exam, working alone allows you to create a study schedule that suits your learning style and can help you to retain information more effectively.

Secondly, working alone allows for greater creativity and innovation. When you are working in a group, there can be a lot of groupthink and a lack of individuality. This can limit the potential for creative and innovative ideas. On the other hand, when you are working alone, you have the freedom to think outside the box and come up with new and unique ideas. For example, when brainstorming ideas for a school project, working alone allows you to think about the project in a more individualized way and can lead to more original and exciting ideas.

Finally, working alone can be beneficial for personal growth and development. When you are working in a group, it can be easy to rely on others and not take responsibility for your own work. On the other hand, when you are working alone, you have to take ownership of your work and make decisions on your own. This can help you to develop important skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and time management. For example, when taking on a leadership role in a school project, working alone allows you to develop these skills and gain confidence in your abilities.

In conclusion, working alone has its own unique advantages that cannot be ignored. While working in a group can be beneficial in certain situations, working alone allows for greater focus, creativity, and personal growth. By recognizing the benefits of working alone, we can learn to utilize this style of work in a way that is beneficial for ourselves and our communities.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Attitude has a profound impact on the success of an individual's life journey. When approached with a positive attitude, the opportunities come in increasing abundance, helping to ensure that the individual’s success reaches its ultimate potential. When approached with a negative attitude, the individual’s self-destructive attitude takes over the entire environment, have a negative effect on the individual’s life and those around them. 

One of the most effective ways to ensure a positive attitude is to set realistic goals. This not only provides validation of where the individual is currently but also provides a roadmap to success that is manageable and achievable. With this roadmap in mind, it is important to stay focused on those realistic goals and to maintain an attitude that is realistic,yet optimistic. Positivity breeds success, setting someone up for the long-term success that they orignally sought out to reach. 

Making the conscious decision to stay positive enables someone to face difficult situations better and handle the roller coaster ride of life’s waves with grace. It also helps to take each step of the journey with more enthusiasm and passion, something that leads to better focus and greater self-belief. Having the right attitude also contributes to having a more meaningful life beyond material gains. 

Attitude is also an attitude that can be controlled. It can be trained through regular practice of self-care and being mindful of day-to-day thoughts and emotions. Establishing a practice of gratitude also helps to foster an attitude of optimism which is essential to achieve success in life. It is important to make sure our attitude remains positive and stays true to our values.

Having a good attitude is essential to success in life. It allows individuals to stay focused and inspired to achieve their goals. By setting realistic goals, practicing positive self-talk, and developing a practice of gratitude, any individual can control their attitude to better their life and the lives of those around them.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I have been thinking a lot about my career path and what I want to do when I grow up. While I have some ideas, I know that there are still many factors that will influence my decision. My family members, my interests, and my passions all play a role in shaping my career goals.

One of the biggest challenges that students face when it comes to choosing a career is the sheer number of options available to them. There are so many different fields to explore, and it can be hard to know which one is right for you. Additionally, the job market is constantly changing, and what might be a promising career path today may not be as viable in the future.

Despite these challenges, I believe that it is important for students to have a clear idea of what they want to study/become when they are older. Having a clear goal can provide direction and motivation, and can help students make informed decisions about their education and career choices. It can also help students to focus their efforts and avoid getting sidetracked by less important pursuits.

However, I also recognize that it is not always possible to have a clear idea of what you want to do. Sometimes, it takes time and experience to discover your true passions and interests. In these cases, I believe that it is important for students to explore their options and try new things. This can help them to gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and can ultimately lead them to a more fulfilling career.

In conclusion, while there are challenges to choosing a career path, I believe that it is important for students to have a clear idea of what they want to study/become when they are older. However, I also recognize that it is not always possible to have a clear goal, and that exploring options and trying new things can be just as important. Ultimately, the key is to be open-minded and to make informed decisions based on your own unique interests and passions.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Problems are often seen as negative and something to be avoided at all costs. However, I believe that problems can actually benefit people and help them in their lives. In this essay, I will discuss the ways in which problems can help people grow and develop, and how they can lead to personal and professional success.

Firstly, problems can help people develop resilience. When faced with a problem, people are forced to think creatively and come up with solutions. This process can be challenging, but it can also help people develop the skills and mindset needed to overcome obstacles in the future. By facing and overcoming problems, people can build their resilience and become better equipped to handle future challenges.

Secondly, problems can help people learn and grow. When faced with a problem, people are often forced to research and learn new things in order to find a solution. This process can lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of the world around us. Additionally, problems can help people identify areas where they need to improve and work on developing new skills.

Thirdly, problems can lead to personal and professional success. When people are able to overcome problems and develop resilience and new skills, they are better equipped to succeed in their personal and professional lives. For example, a person who has faced and overcome a problem in their personal life may be better able to handle difficult situations at work, leading to greater job satisfaction and success.

In conclusion, problems can benefit people and help them in their lives. By developing resilience, learning and growing, and leading to personal and professional success, problems can be seen as opportunities for growth and development. It is important to approach problems with a positive mindset and to use them as opportunities to learn and grow.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that adding hours to students’ school schedules can have both positive and negative effects. While longer school days may improve academic performance, it can also negatively impact extracurricular activities and overall quality of life. In this essay, I will analyze the potential positive and negative effects of adding hours to students’ school schedules.

On the positive side, adding hours to students’ school schedules may improve academic performance. Research has shown that students who attend school for longer hours tend to perform better academically. This is because they have more time to learn and practice new concepts, complete assignments, and work on projects. Additionally, longer school days may provide students with more opportunities to receive extra help and support from teachers. This can be especially beneficial for students who are struggling academically.

However, adding hours to students’ school schedules can also have negative effects. For example, it can negatively impact extracurricular activities. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other extracurricular activities after school. If school days are extended, students may have less time to participate in these activities. This can be especially problematic for students who rely on extracurricular activities to develop important social and leadership skills.

Additionally, longer school days can negatively impact students’ overall quality of life. Students who attend school for longer hours may feel more stressed and overwhelmed. This can lead to decreased mental health and well-being. Furthermore, longer school days can also impact students’ family lives. If students are in school for longer hours, their families may have less time to spend together and engage in important activities.

In conclusion, adding hours to students’ school schedules can have both positive and negative effects. While longer school days may improve academic performance, it can also negatively impact extracurricular activities and overall quality of life. It is important for educators and policymakers to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of extending school hours before making any decisions. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide students with the best possible educational experience while also promoting their overall well-being.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

This quote is supported by the example of the author's own experience of being influenced by the actions of others. The author states that they have been influenced by the actions of others in their life, such as their parents and friends, and that these examples have had a lasting impact on their own behavior. The author argues that examples are more powerful than money in shaping our behavior because they are tangible and provide a clear model to follow.

"Ummm... Okay!  Here's my essay:

Taking elective classes instead of music, drama, or art classes can have a lot of advantages when it comes to graduating from high school. For one, elective classes can help you figure out what you want to do after high school. Like, if you take a computer science class, you might realize that you really like coding and want to pursue a career in that field. Or, if you take a business class, you might learn that you're good at working with people and want to start your own business.

Another advantage of taking electives is that it can help you stand out when you're applying to college. Like, if you take a lot of challenging classes, it shows that you're not afraid to push yourself and try new things. And, if you take classes that are related to your interests, it shows that you're passionate about those things and will probably be more motivated in college.

Also, taking electives can help you figure out what you're good at and what you're not good at. Like, if you take a math class and realize that you're really bad at it, you can try something else that you're better at. Or, if you take a writing class and realize that you're really good at it, you can try to get a job as a writer after high school.

Lastly, taking electives can help you make new friends. Like, if you take a class with someone who likes the same thing as you, you can bond over that and become friends. Or, if you take a class with someone who's really different from you, you can learn about their culture and perspective and become more open-minded.

In conclusion, taking elective classes instead of music, drama, or art classes can have a lot of advantages when it comes to graduating from high school. It can help you figure out what you want to do after high school, stand out when applying to college, figure out what you're good at and what you're not good at, and make new friends. So, if you have the chance to take electives, you should definitely take them!",1,llama2_chat,0

"The Importance of Soccer Skills and Regular Practice

Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, and for good reason. It's a fun and exciting game that requires a lot of skill and hard work to excel at. As an 8th-grade student, I believe that it's important to develop soccer skills and practice regularly to improve.

Firstly, individual sports skills such as soccer require regular practice to improve. Just like any other sport, soccer requires practice to develop the necessary skills to play at a high level. For example, practicing passing, dribbling, and shooting can help improve your overall soccer skills. Additionally, practicing regularly can help improve your endurance and overall fitness, which are essential for playing soccer.

Secondly, learning tricks and techniques to use in soccer can also help improve your skills. For example, learning how to kick the ball to teammates or how to defend against an opponent can help you become a better soccer player. Additionally, learning how to goalkeep can help you become a valuable asset to your team.

Thirdly, challenging yourself to compete for opportunities such as being chosen for an international team can help you push yourself to become a better soccer player. Competing against other players can help you develop your skills and improve your overall performance. Additionally, being chosen for an international team can be a great accomplishment and can help you gain exposure to other soccer players and coaches.

Fourthly, it's important to understand that success is not easily achieved and involves facing difficulties and working hard. Becoming a skilled soccer player takes time and dedication. It requires hard work and practice, and there will be times when you will face difficulties and setbacks. However, it's important to keep pushing through these difficulties and continue to work hard to achieve your goals.

Lastly, reflecting on life experience and learning from mistakes, along with hard work, can lead to success in soccer. As an 8th-grade student, I have learned that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. However, it's important to learn from these mistakes and continue to work hard to improve. Additionally, reflecting on life experience can help you gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn't, which can help you improve your soccer skills.

In conclusion, developing soccer skills and practicing regularly is essential for becoming a",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

"Hey there!  So, I was assigned this essay about Winston Churchill's quote ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and, man, it's really got me thinking.  Like, I've definitely failed at stuff before, you know? Like that time I tried to make a volcano in science class and it ended up being more like a tiny little puddle of bubbly goo.  But, you know, I didn't let that get me down! I mean, I learned from my mistake and tried again. And again. And again. 

Anyway, I think this quote is really important because it shows that success isn't just about never failing, but about how you react to those failures. If you get all down and stuff when things don't go your way, then you're gonna give up way too easy. But if you keep on going and learning, then you're gonna get better and better.  Like, I've had some pretty tough exams in math class, but I didn't let that get me down. I studied and studied until I got the grade I wanted. And you know what? It paid off! 

This quote also makes me think about how it's okay to make mistakes. Like, seriously okay.  We all make mistakes, but it's how we learn from them that matters. So, instead of being all bummed out and stuff, we should be like, ""Oh, cool! A chance to learn and grow!""  And then we can use that knowledge to be even better next time. 

I think this quote is important for other people too, because it shows them that they're not alone. Like, everyone fails sometimes, but if they keep on going and learning, then they'll be successful too.  It's like, the more you fail, the closer you get to success!  And who doesn't want that?

"Albert Schweitzer was a prominent figure in the medical and humanitarian fields, known for his dedication to improving the lives of others. One of his famous quotes was ""Example is the only thing in influencing others,"" which suggests that the best way to influence others is through direct action and setting a positive example. However, I disagree with this statement and believe that influencing someone does not necessarily require being a direct example for them.

While it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. For instance, people can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others even if they are not physically present or directly observing them. This can happen through media, such as television and the internet, which allow people to learn about and be inspired by the actions and behaviors of others.

Furthermore, even when people are directly observing a positive example, it is not always the case that they will be influenced by it. People have their own unique experiences and perspectives, and they may not always be able to relate to or understand the experiences of others. Additionally, people may be influenced by negative examples or by the absence of positive examples, which can be just as powerful in shaping their behavior and attitudes.

In conclusion, while it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. People can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others through media, and even by negative examples or the absence of positive examples. Ultimately, the most effective way to influence others is to understand their unique experiences and perspectives, and to provide them with the support and resources they need to achieve their goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Technology has had a profound impact on people's lives, and it has brought about numerous positive effects. From helping people find jobs to aiding in the military, technology has revolutionized the way we live our lives. In this essay, we will explore some of the positive effects of technology on people's lives.

One of the most significant ways that technology has impacted people's lives is through job opportunities. With the rise of the internet, people can now search for job openings from anywhere in the world. This has made it easier for people to find work that suits their skills and interests. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to work remotely, which has become increasingly popular in recent years. This allows people to have more flexibility in their work schedules and to work from anywhere in the world.

Another way that technology has positively impacted people's lives is through socializing. With the rise of social media platforms, people can now connect with friends and family from all over the world. This has made it easier for people to stay in touch with loved ones, regardless of where they are. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to meet new people and form new relationships. This has led to a more connected and diverse society.

Technology has also had a significant impact on the way people shop. With the rise of e-commerce, people can now shop from anywhere in the world, without ever leaving their homes. This has made shopping more convenient and accessible for people, and it has also led to the growth of the online shopping industry. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to compare prices and products from multiple retailers, which has led to more informed purchasing decisions.

Finally, technology has had a profound impact on science and research. With the development of new technologies, scientists have been able to make significant advances in various fields. For example, technology has made it possible for doctors to perform surgeries that were previously impossible. Additionally, technology has made it possible for scientists to study the universe in ways that were previously unimaginable.

In conclusion, technology has had numerous positive effects on people's lives. From helping people find jobs to aiding in the military, technology has revolutionized the way we live our lives. While there are certainly some negative effects of technology, the positive effects cannot be ignored. As technology continues to advance, we can only imagine",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey there!  So, you know how sometimes you gotta do things that are good for you, but they're also kinda boring? Like, I don't know, doing homework or something?  Well, I think it's way more fun to do things that are both enjoyable and educational at the same time! 

Okay, so here are three activities that I think fit the bill:

First up, let's talk about playing a musical instrument!  I know, I know, it might seem like something you'd only do if you're super into music, but trust me, it's way more fun than it is boring.  For one thing, it's like a total brain workout! You gotta remember all these notes and chords and stuff, which is like, super good for your brain. Plus, it's really fun to play with other people and make music together.  Like, my friend Sarah and I started a band last year, and it's so much fun! We play at school events and stuff, and it's just the best feeling in the world. 

Next up, let's talk about...  ...volunteering!  Yeah, I know, it might not sound like the most exciting thing in the world, but trust me, it's way more fun than you think!  For one thing, it's like, super good for your soul or whatever. You get to help people and make a difference in your community, which is like, the best feeling ever. Plus, it's a great way to meet new people and make friends.  Like, I volunteer at this animal shelter near my house, and it's just the best. I get to play with all the puppies and kittens, and it's just the best feeling in the world.

"Failure is a crucial aspect of achieving success. It is a natural part of the learning process and helps individuals develop resilience and perseverance. Sir Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement holds true when considering the importance of failure in achieving success.

One of the primary benefits of failure is that it teaches individuals valuable lessons. By experiencing failure, individuals can identify what went wrong and learn from their mistakes. This knowledge can be used to improve future endeavors and increase the chances of success. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed 1,000 times before he successfully invented the light bulb. Each failure brought him closer to the solution, and his persistence ultimately led to a successful invention.

Another benefit of failure is that it fosters resilience. When individuals experience failure, they must learn to bounce back and continue working towards their goals. This resilience is essential for achieving long-term success. For instance, J.K. Rowling faced numerous rejections from publishers before finally finding a publisher for her Harry Potter series. Despite these setbacks, she continued to write and eventually achieved great success.

Churchill's statement also holds true in the context of failure. Failure is not fatal, and individuals can continue to work towards their goals even after experiencing setbacks. Churchill himself faced numerous failures throughout his political career, including the loss of the 1945 election. However, he continued to work towards his goals and eventually became Prime Minister in 1951.

In conclusion, failure is an essential aspect of achieving success. It teaches individuals valuable lessons and fosters resilience. Churchill's statement holds true, as individuals can continue to work towards their goals even after experiencing setbacks. Failure is not fatal, and it is the courage to continue that counts.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, so bear with me on this essay! 😅

Technology has totally changed the way people live their lives, and it's hard to imagine a time before smartphones and social media. While technology has made some things easier and more convenient, it's also had some negative effects on relationships, buying items online, and spending time with family.

One of the biggest positive effects of technology is how it's made it easier to connect with people. With social media, messaging apps, and video calls, people can stay in touch with their friends and family no matter where they are in the world. It's also made it easier to make new friends and connect with people who share similar interests. But, on the other hand, technology can also make people feel lonely and isolated. When people spend too much time on their phones or computers, they can start to neglect their face-to-face relationships and miss out on important moments with their loved ones.

Another thing technology has changed is the way we buy things. With online shopping, people can buy whatever they want from the comfort of their own homes. It's so much easier than having to go to a store and deal with crowds and long lines. But, sometimes, technology can make people lazy and less likely to go out and explore their surroundings. When people only buy things online, they can miss out on the sensory experiences of shopping in person and discovering new places.

Technology has also changed the way we spend time with our families. With all the screens and devices, it's easy to get caught up in our own little worlds and forget to spend quality time with our loved ones. But, technology can also make it easier to stay connected with family members who live far away. Video calls and messaging apps can help people stay in touch with their families even when they're not in the same room.

As for kids and technology, it's a bit of a tricky situation. On the one hand, technology can be a great tool for learning and exploring new things. But, on the other hand, it can also be a distraction and make it harder for kids to focus and pay attention. Parents should definitely set limits on how much time their kids",1,llama2_chat,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always been fascinated by the idea of longer summer vacations. I believe that longer summer vacations have a significant impact on teenagers' lives, both positively and negatively. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of longer summer vacations and their implications.

One of the primary advantages of longer summer vacations is that it gives teenagers more time to spend with their family and friends. During the school year, teenagers are often busy with schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and other commitments, which can make it challenging to spend quality time with loved ones. Longer summer vacations provide an opportunity for teenagers to reconnect with their families and friends, strengthening their relationships and creating lasting memories.

Additionally, longer summer vacations can provide teenagers with a much-needed break from the rigors of school. The academic year can be stressful, with teenagers facing a lot of pressure to perform well in school. Longer summer vacations give teenagers a chance to recharge, relax, and pursue their hobbies and interests without the added stress of schoolwork.

However, there are also some negative effects associated with longer summer vacations. One of the primary concerns is that teenagers may become disconnected from their academic pursuits during the summer. Without the structure of school, teenagers may not be as motivated to continue learning and may fall behind in their studies.

Another potential negative effect of longer summer vacations is that teenagers may become bored or unproductive during their time off. Without a clear plan or structure, teenagers may find themselves spending their summer doing nothing or engaging in unhealthy activities such as substance abuse or bullying.

In conclusion, longer summer vacations have both advantages and disadvantages. While they provide teenagers with more time to spend with their family and friends and a much-needed break from the rigors of school, they can also lead to disconnection from academic pursuits and unproductive behavior. It is essential for teenagers to find a balance between enjoying their summer vacation and maintaining their academic goals.

In my opinion, schools should provide teenagers with a longer summer vacation to allow them to recharge and spend quality time with their loved ones. However, schools should also provide resources and support to help teenagers stay engaged in",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Graduating high school in three years instead of four could provide students with several potential benefits. On the academic front, this would likely lead to a more advanced curriculum where students can cover more material in the span of three years as opposed to four. Furthermore, students may be better prepared for college given the exposure to more challenging classes and the chance to complete appropriate coursework earlier.

This option could also benefit students’ extracurricular activities. With an accelerated timeline, students could move on to college a year earlier than their peers, freeing up time to partake in more campus activities or take on a summer internship. Furthermore, those who decide to save money by enrolling in a less expensive college for this fourth year could use this time to take more classes or get work experience.

However, graduating high school in three years could also have a negative impact on student life. Without an additional year of high school, students may miss out on some of the traditional experiences, such as playing sports or attending school dances. Additionally, those who are unsure of their post-high school plans may not have enough time to research their options or gain sufficient familiarity with the college application process.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Sure, here's my essay response:

As an 8th grader, I'm starting to think about my future career and profession. I want to be a video game designer, and I know I need to start preparing for it now. To research courses related to this career, I looked up different high schools and colleges that have strong video game design programs. I found out that some high schools even have their own game design clubs where students can work on projects together and learn from professionals in the field.

I also investigated the experience required to be successful in the video game design industry. I found out that most video game designers have a bachelor's degree in computer science, graphic design, or a related field. They also need to have a good understanding of programming languages like Java and C++, as well as design software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. To make progress towards my goals while in high school, I plan to take advanced math and computer science classes, as well as join the school's game design club to gain hands-on experience.

One advantage of focusing on video game design in high school is that it can help me build a strong portfolio of work to show to colleges and potential employers. It can also give me a head start on learning the skills and software I'll need to succeed in the industry. However, there are also some disadvantages to focusing on one career so early on. For example, if I change my mind about what I want to do, I may have wasted time and resources on a career that I'm not interested in anymore.

Overall, I think it's important to start preparing for my future career in high school. By taking challenging classes and gaining hands-on experience, I can set myself up for success in the video game design industry. While there are some risks to focusing on one career so early on, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. With hard work and dedication, I know I can achieve my goal of becoming a successful video game designer.",1,llama2_chat,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that changing the policy to require a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams is a positive change. While there are some potential drawbacks to this policy, the benefits of improved grades, increased physical activity, and increased college acceptance outweigh the negatives.

One of the main benefits of this policy is that it will encourage students to work harder to maintain their grades. By requiring a minimum grade of B to join sports teams, students will be more motivated to study and improve their academic performance. This will not only benefit them in the short term by allowing them to participate in sports, but it will also benefit them in the long term by increasing their chances of getting into a good college.

Another benefit of this policy is that it will increase physical activity among students. Participating in sports is a great way to stay active and healthy, and by requiring a minimum grade of B to join teams, more students will be encouraged to participate. This will not only benefit their physical health, but it will also benefit their mental health by reducing stress and improving mood.

Finally, this policy will increase the chances of college acceptance for students who maintain a minimum grade of B. Many colleges look at academic performance when making admissions decisions, and by requiring a minimum grade of B to join sports teams, students will be more likely to meet the academic requirements for college admission. This will not only benefit the students who maintain the minimum grade, but it will also benefit the school as a whole by increasing the number of students who go on to college.

While there are some potential drawbacks to this policy, such as the possibility of excluding students who are struggling academically but still want to participate in sports, the benefits of improved grades, increased physical activity, and increased college acceptance outweigh the negatives. By requiring a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams, students will be more motivated to work harder academically, stay active physically, and increase their chances of college acceptance.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Graduating early can be a great opportunity for high school students. Not only does it help to reduce their high school workload, but it can also give them a chance to get a jump-start on their college career. With graduation comes the potential to start college classes sooner, create a more well-rounded college application, and to become better prepared for the demands of college-level work.

To succeed in taking advantage of the opportunity to graduate early, students must plan ahead. As soon as they decide that they are interested in graduating early, they can begin researching the options that their school has available. They may need to look into accelerated courses, available dual-enrollment programs, or other options that their school can offer. It is important to take the time to ask questions and research the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option before selecting one. Doing so can help make sure students are prepared for the increased workload and complexity that comes with taking accelerated classes.

For students who are looking to get a jump-start on their college career, graduating early can be an excellent opportunity. With proper planning and dedication, students can take advantage of the opportunity to reduce their high school load and get a head start on their educational pursuits.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Cellphone usage in school can introduce a variety of risks for students. With access to phones, students may be more likely to engage in cyberbullying, as it is easier to hide and spread hurtful comments online. In addition, the risk of cheating can increase, as students can access answers from the internet or exchange information among themselves quickly and discreetly. Moreover, cellphones can be a distraction, making it harder for students to pay attention in class and complete their work. With all of these risks in mind, it is clear why schools should not allow the use of cellphones. Allowing for such an activity in the classroom not only compromises students’ safety and attentiveness, but also encourages a culture of cheating and bullying.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Winston Churchill famously said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This statement emphasizes the important role that failure can have in the pursuit of success. Failure can be viewed as an opportunity to learn and grow, and those that understand this are in a better position to reach their desired outcomes. 

Making mistakes should not be avoided, as this prevents us from fully embracing the learning process. Instead, mistakes should be viewed as chances to learn and discover new ideas and approaches. Enthusiasm and dedication should be shown when taking on these failures, as this provides a chance to think through the situation clearly. 

The importance of trying, making mistakes, and learning cannot be overstated when it comes to achieving success. By learning from our own mistakes on our journey to success, we can save time, effort, and resources. Additionally, learning from the failures of others can give insight and understanding to common mistakes, ensuring that we don’t miss steps or overlook potential issues. 

All in all, it is clear that failure can actually be a positive element in our lives. It allows us to grow and understand ourselves better, as well as providing the opportunity to find better solutions and approaches to the same problems. By not vilifying failure, and instead learning from and embracing it, we open ourselves up to a greater range of possibilities, which is what success is all about.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Taking courses over the summer or in the evening offers numerous benefits for high school students looking to graduate early. One of the most attractive benefits is that it can bridge gaps in a student's education, helping them to accelerate their coursework and graduate earlier. Doing this can give students more time for independent study and other activities that can help with their future academic and professional goals.

Another advantage of taking courses over the summer or in the evening is that it gives students time to focus on certain subjects that they are interested in. This allows them to take classes and specialize in certain areas that can help them stand out on college applications or job applications later on. It can also help them build their resume and further demonstrates their commitment to their education.

Lastly, by taking summer or evening courses, high school students can use their available time to explore other educational opportunities such as internships or research opportunities without consuming the bulk of their regular school day. Doing this can provide the student with valuable real-world experience and knowledge that can be difficult to gain in a traditional classroom setting.

In conclusion, taking courses over the summer or in the evening can provide high school students with a wealth of benefits, from bridging gaps in their education to exploring educational opportunities outside the classroom. For students looking to graduate earlier, these courses are a great way to maximize their time and make the most of their high school experience.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4

"Despite growing concern of student debt, students still have the right to pursue any career they deem fit. While working in college can offer financial relief, this should not be the only reason. All students should be aware of the value of work experience and should seek to demonstrate their ability to make the most of their time and effort in any job they secure. 

Before committing to any job, students should consider the following factors: Are they interested in this job, will it offer them the experience they need, how will the job benefit them in the long run? Education should also be a factor, as certain jobs may require more training and qualifications than others. Lastly, student should take their parents' advice on their career journey into account. Parents have attained their wealth of knowledge through life experiences, and their advice can help students to make better informed decisions on their first steps.

""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark."" It's like, totally deep, you know?

Okay, so here's why I think it's true.  When we set our goals too low, we're basically settling for mediocrity. Like, why bother trying to be great when you can just be average? That's not exactly something to be proud of, right? But when we aim high and fail, at least we can say we gave it our all. And who knows, maybe we'll learn something new and come back stronger next time.

But when we set our goals too low, we're basically guaranteeing that we won't achieve anything truly remarkable. I mean, think about it. If you're just trying to get by in life, you're never gonna make a real impact. You're never gonna change the world or do something that really matters. And that's just sad, you know?

So, like, let's all try to set our goals a little higher, okay?  Don't be afraid to aim for the stars, even if you miss, you'll land among the clouds. Or something like that. 

Anyway, that's my two cents. Can I get extra credit for this essay? 

Thanks, Mr. Johnson!",1,llama2_chat,1
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, community service is totes important, you know? It's like, helping others and stuff, and it's just... good. 

So, like, a principal can decide who should do community service by looking at who's been acting up in class or something.  Like, if someone's been causing trouble and not paying attention, they should have to do some community service to learn their lesson. 

For example, like, if someone in my class has been talking too much during lessons, the principal could make them clean up the school's garden for a day.  It's like, a way for them to learn how to be responsible and stuff, while also helping out the school. 

And it's not just about learning a lesson, it's also about giving back to the community.  Like, when we volunteer at the local animal shelter, we're helping those puppers and kitties find forever homes.  It's just... so... heartwarming. 

But, like, it's not just about the animals.  It's also about helping people in need.  Like, if someone's been bullying someone else, the principal could make them do community service to help the bullied person feel better.  It's like, a way for them to learn empathy and stuff.

So, yeah. Community service is totes important.  And it's not just about getting in trouble or doing something boring.  It's about giving back to the community and learning valuable lessons. 

Anyway, gotta go.  More homework!",1,llama2_chat,1
"The decision to extend the school day has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some people believe that extending the school day can lead to better academic performance, others argue that it can have negative consequences on students and teachers. In this essay, I will analyze the consequences of extending the school day on both students and teachers, considering the effects on their physical and mental well-being, as well as their personal lives.

Firstly, extending the school day can have negative consequences on students' physical and mental well-being. Studies have shown that students who attend school for longer hours have a higher risk of obesity, sleep deprivation, and stress. Longer school days can also lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle and an increased risk of health problems. Additionally, students who attend school for longer hours may experience burnout and fatigue, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

On the other hand, extending the school day can also have positive consequences on students' academic performance. By providing more time for learning and studying, students may be better prepared for exams and tests. Additionally, longer school days can provide students with more opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities and clubs, which can help them develop important skills and interests.

However, extending the school day can also have negative consequences on teachers' work-life balance. Teachers who are required to work longer hours may experience increased stress and burnout, which can lead to decreased job satisfaction and a higher turnover rate. Additionally, teachers who work longer hours may have less time for their personal lives, which can lead to decreased family time and social isolation.

To address these potential issues with the decision to extend the school day, schools can explore alternative solutions. For example, schools could provide students with more opportunities for physical activity outside of school hours, such as after-school sports teams or clubs. Schools could also provide students with more flexible schedules, allowing them to attend school at different times or attend school part-time. Additionally, schools could provide teachers with more support and resources, such as additional staff or training, to help them manage their workload and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

In conclusion, the decision to extend the school day can have both positive and negative consequences on students and teachers. While extending the school day can lead to better academic performance",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"First impressions are a crucial aspect of our lives. They can provide valuable insights into a person's personality, living conditions, and overall lifestyle. When we first meet someone, we make assumptions about their life based on their appearance, behavior, and demeanor. These assumptions can be both positive and negative, and they can shape our interactions with the person in the future.

One of the most significant ways that first impressions can affect our perceptions of someone's life is through their personality. When we meet someone for the first time, we often make assumptions about their personality based on their appearance and behavior. For example, if someone is dressed in expensive clothes and carrying a designer handbag, we might assume that they are wealthy and successful. On the other hand, if someone is wearing old, tattered clothes and carrying a backpack, we might assume that they are struggling financially.

However, it's important to remember that these assumptions are often based on stereotypes and may not accurately reflect a person's true personality. For example, someone who is dressed in expensive clothes might actually be very down-to-earth and humble, while someone who is wearing old clothes might be very outgoing and confident. Therefore, it's essential to be cautious when making assumptions about someone's personality based on their first impression.

Another way that first impressions can affect our perceptions of someone's life is through their living conditions. When we meet someone for the first time, we often make assumptions about their living conditions based on their appearance and behavior. For example, if someone is wearing expensive clothes and carrying a designer handbag, we might assume that they live in a luxurious home with all the latest amenities. On the other hand, if someone is wearing old, tattered clothes and carrying a backpack, we might assume that they live in a rundown apartment with limited resources.

However, it's important to remember that these assumptions are often based on stereotypes and may not accurately reflect a person's true living conditions. For example, someone who is dressed in expensive clothes might actually live in a small, cramped apartment with limited resources, while someone who is wearing old clothes might live in a large, spacious home with all the latest amenities. Therefore, it's essential to be cautious when making assumptions about someone's living conditions based on their first impression.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey there!  So, you want me to write an essay about starting a homework club in our school?  Well, I'm not sure if I'm the right person for the job, but I'll give it a shot! 😅

So, here's the thing: I think a homework club could be really beneficial for students like me who sometimes struggle with completing their homework on time.  I mean, let's be real, homework can be super stressful, especially when you have a bunch of other things going on in your life.  And let's not forget about the late-night cramming sessions that can lead to...  burnout. 😓

But, if we had a homework club, it could be a safe space for us to work on our assignments together and get help from our peers and teachers.  Just imagine it: a cozy room with comfy chairs and dim lighting, filled with students who are also struggling with their homework.  It would be like a homework sanctuary! 😍

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But won't it be distracting to have a homework club during school hours?"" And to that, I say...  have you seen the chaos that is the library during lunchtime? 😂 It's like a free-for-all!  But seriously, I think it would be more productive to have a designated time for homework, rather than trying to squeeze it in during already packed schedules. Plus, think of all the socializing we could do during that time! 

Of course, there are some potential downsides to consider.  Like, what if not everyone wants to participate? Or what if some students don't take it seriously and end up slacking off?  But, I think those problems could be solved with some proper planning and organization. 

So",1,llama2_chat,3
"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay about why people should make their own decisions and how it can give them more freedom. Like, I know some people might be like, ""Ugh, I don't want to make my own decisions, I'll just let others do it for me,"" but trust me, it's way better to make your own choices.

First of all, when you make your own decisions, you're in control of your own life. You don't have to rely on anyone else to make choices for you, which means you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. It's like, super liberating, you know? You don't have to worry about what other people think or what they want you to do. You can just do what feels right for you, and that's it.

And another thing is, when you make your own decisions, you learn so much more about yourself. Like, you might discover things about yourself that you never knew before, like your values or your beliefs. And that's, like, super important for your personal growth and development. You can't learn that stuff if you're just following other people's decisions all the time.

Plus, when you make your own decisions, you're showing respect for yourself. Like, you're saying, ""Hey, I know what's best for me, and I'm going to do it."" It's like, a form of self-love, you know? And who doesn't want to love themselves more?

Now, some people might be like, ""But what about when other people make better decisions than you?"" And I'm like, ""Dude, that's not the point."" The point is, you should make your own decisions and stand by them, even if they're not the best decisions in the world. At least you'll know that you made them yourself, and you can be proud of that.

In conclusion, making your own decisions is way better than letting other people make them for you. It gives you freedom, helps you learn more about yourself, and shows respect for yourself. So, like, go ahead and make your own decisions, and don't let anyone else tell",1,llama2_chat,3
"Hey, Mrs. Smith! Here's my essay on inspiring people who have experienced failure and how it's contributed to their success.

 Failure is something that we all experience at some point in our lives. Whether it's not getting the grade we wanted on a test or getting rejected from our dream college, failure can be tough to deal with. But what if I told you that failure can actually be a good thing? That's right, folks! There are tons of inspiring people who have experienced failure and have used it to their advantage.

One of my favorite examples is Thomas Edison. He's the guy who invented the light bulb, right? Well, what they don't teach you in history class is that Edison failed over a thousand times before he finally got it right. Can you imagine? 1,000 failures! But he didn't let that discourage him. He kept on trying until he succeeded. And guess what? His persistence paid off!

Another person who experienced failure but still became successful is J.K. Rowling. She wrote the first Harry Potter book when she was a single mom living on welfare. Can you imagine how many rejections she must have gotten before someone finally published her book? But she didn't let that stop her. She kept on writing until her book became a bestseller. Now she's one of the richest women in the world!

I think what's so cool about these examples is that they show us that failure isn't the end of the world. Sure, it can be tough to deal with at first, but if we keep on trying, we can turn it into something amazing. Edison and Rowling didn't let their failures hold them back. They used them to fuel their success.

So, what can we learn from these inspiring people? Well, for starters, we can learn to not be afraid of failure. It's okay to make mistakes. In fact, it's more than okay – it's necessary! If we don't take risks and try new things, we'll never know what we're capable of. And secondly, we can learn to be persistent. Don't give up just because things get tough. Keep on going",1,llama2_chat,2
"Recent studies suggest that providing healthier options for school lunches can have immense benefits for students. Replacing the burgers, fries, and pizza currently offered with more nutritious meals, such as salads, protein-rich dishes, and fresh fruit can significantly improve the concentration, focus, and motivation of students. This increase in energy would likely lead to improved academic success. 

However, there can be great difficulty in getting students to choose the healthier options. Many students may prefer the regular school food, such as pizza, since it is familiar and tasty. Some students may even feel that the healthier food choices are less satisfying and require additional effort to find the ingredients.

Nevertheless, there are still many potential benefits of providing healthier school lunch options, such as socialization. By replacing the regular options with healthier, more nutritious meals, students can also socialize with their peers while still Mastering new, healthier habits. Lastly, healthier meals often don't cause the “crash” that can result from sugary, fatty meals, reducing the likelihood of students feeling sleepy in the classroom. 

In conclusion, switching to healthier school lunch options could have a multitude of benefits for both the students and the school. It can improve academic performance, lay the groundwork for healthier habits, and reduce feelings of sleepiness in the classrooms. As such, it is highly recommended that schools consider making the switch to healthier options.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Introduction:

In today's world, students of all ages are constantly interacting with each other in various settings, whether it be in the classroom, on the playground, or even online. However, it is important to create a program where older and younger students can interact in an educational setting, where both age groups can learn from each other and help each other out. This type of program is important for students to participate in, as it provides a unique opportunity for students to develop important skills and knowledge that can benefit them throughout their lives.

Benefits of Intergenerational Learning:

Intergenerational learning is the process of learning from and with people of different ages. It has been shown to have numerous benefits for both older and younger students. For older students, intergenerational learning can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as they can share their knowledge and experiences with younger students. This can also help older students to stay mentally sharp and active, as they engage in new and challenging learning experiences.

For younger students, intergenerational learning can provide a valuable opportunity to learn from and with older students. Younger students can benefit from the wisdom and experience of older students, as well as the perspective and insights that come with having lived through different times and events. This can help younger students to develop a more well-rounded understanding of the world and to better prepare them for the future.

In addition to the benefits for the students themselves, intergenerational learning can also have positive effects on the school community as a whole. By creating a program where older and younger students can interact in an educational setting, schools can foster a sense of community and collaboration, and help to bridge the gap between different age groups.

Grades that should benefit from this type of program:

While intergenerational learning can be beneficial for students of all ages, there are certain grades that may benefit more from this type of program. For example, younger students in grades K-2 may benefit from the opportunity to learn from and with older students who can provide them with a more structured and organized learning environment. Older students in grades 6-8 may also benefit from this type of program, as they can share their knowledge and experiences with younger students and help to mentor and guide them through the challenges of middle school.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, creating a program where older and younger students can interact in an",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"One of the most famous individuals who has achieved success by being unapologetically themselves is Ellen DeGeneres. DeGeneres courageously came out as a lesbian on her show in 1997, setting an example for many people to follow. Her unique sense of humor and upbeat attitude has earned her much admiration in the entertainment industry even after coming out.

What makes this individual stand out is her willingness to be vulnerable and authentic to her fans. DeGeneres never shied away from showing who she truly is, despite the risk that it could have cost her endorsements and fans. This demonstrates the risk-benefit of wanting to be just like someone else versus following the crowd. 

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson’s advice concerning the importance of being yourself has been echoed throughout the years. He states, ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" 

Surprisingly, the most important requirement for achieving success in life is much less complicated than trying to be just like someone else or following the crowd. It is to be true to yourself—take the path that is unique to you. Being true to yourself requires the courage to face fears and reject the expectations placed on us by society. By being honest with yourself and setting your own expectations, you can be content with who you are and discover the valuable role that you can play in improving the world. 

In conclusion, the importance of being yourself should never be underestimated. Despite the risks and pressures of society, it is essential to embrace one’s own unique qualities and dreams. Only then can one discover true freedom and success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Taking a class in a classroom setting as opposed to taking one online can offer a variety of distinct benefits. In a traditional classroom setting, students may benefit from face-to-face discussion and interactions with their peers, developing a stronger sense of community that can encourage higher engagement in class activities. Additionally, the scheduled class time can be helpful for students in developing a regular routine for studying and completing assignments, as well as for keeping themselves on track. Furthermore, being physically present in a classroom allows the student to feel more connected to their instructor, which can provide regular feedback on assignments and help to ensure progress. 

Being in a classroom setting also offers access to hands-on learning which can be immensely beneficial for certain subjects such as physics, chemistry and engineering. Furthermore, a physical classroom setting allows for a better understanding of the material, as students are able to interact directly with the instructor and receive demonstrations firsthand. 

In contrast, taking courses online can have its advantages as well. Courses online are often more convenient and can be taken at any time from the comfort of the student’s own home. Additionally, depending on the course materials, online courses can be more cost effective, with fewer materials required and lower tuition costs from universities. For non-traditional students, online courses also provide a more flexible option for taking courses as needed from any location. 

Ultimately, the best option for any individual might depend on their own individual needs, the subject material, and their preferred learning style. However, depending on the subject material, taking courses in a classroom setting can offer its own unique and varied benefits that may prove invaluable in educational advancement.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Setting a good example is the best way to influence others for a variety of reasons. First, it sets a clear vision for how a person, or an organization, thinks and behaves. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. was a prime example of someone who set a high moral standard that extended beyond his own actions. His commitment to equality inspired millions to act justly and bring about much-needed reform during the civil rights movement.

Second, setting a positive example can lead to greater motivation in others. Take, for example, a personal trainer. By setting a good example of discipline and dedication, they will often be able to encourage clients to strive to reach their personal goals.

Finally, setting a good example models the desired behavior and helps to foster a sense of inclusion and mutual respect among team members. This can create an environment that is conducive to open and honest communication, leading to greater collaboration and problem-solving.

Setting a good example is indeed the best way to influence others. From Martin Luther King Jr.'s courageous stances to the motivating example of a personal trainer, setting a positive example can have far-reaching ripple effects.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"When considering the advantages and disadvantages of older and younger students interacting with each other, the potential for such an experience to be beneficial is immense. Programs such as intergenerational activities and peers mentoring systems can be useful in developing relationships among students. Through these activities, older students can help to teach and guide younger students in various aspects, including but not limited to, academics. 

Sports are often an overlooked component when discussing the importance of older and younger student interaction. Besides the physical health benefits associated with sport, student also gain an understanding of team building, communication, problem solving and respect. Through sports, younger students are able to learn these qualities from their older peers and mutually build relationships. As such, it is clear that sports hold an important role in a program promoting interactions between these two generations.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Failure: The Stepping Stone to Success

As an 8th grader, I have learned that failure is a crucial part of achieving success. It may seem counterintuitive, but failure can actually help us grow and learn more than success. When we fail, we are given the opportunity to identify our mistakes and improve upon them. This process of trial and error can lead to innovation and progress.

Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" These words are particularly relevant when it comes to confronting failure. When we encounter failure, it can be tempting to give up and lose enthusiasm. However, as Churchill reminds us, it is important to stay enthusiastic and keep trying. By doing so, we can turn failure into an opportunity for growth and learning.

One example of this is a scientist who is trying to develop a new drug. They may try many experiments, and each time they fail, they may become discouraged. However, they must remember that each failure brings them closer to success. By learning from their mistakes and continuing to try, they can eventually develop a successful drug that can improve people's lives.

Another important aspect of dealing with failure is the difference between staying positive and feeling secure versus feeling depressed and giving up. When we stay positive, we are more likely to approach challenges with a growth mindset and a willingness to learn. On the other hand, when we feel secure, we may become complacent and less motivated to improve. By staying positive and motivated, we can turn failure into a stepping stone to success.

Finally, the book ""The Life of an Indian"" serves as a powerful example of how failure can lead to success. The book tells the story of a young boy who faces many challenges and failures, but ultimately learns to persevere and achieve his goals. By reading this book, we can see how failure can be a transformative experience that helps us grow and learn.

In conclusion, failure is an essential part of the journey to success. By staying enthusiastic and continuing to try, we can turn failure into an opportunity for growth and learning. Whether it's a scientist trying many experiments or a young boy facing challenges,",1,llama2_chat,3
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, I guess I'm gonna write this essay about the disadvantages of being in a world where people try to force you to conform. 

Okay, so, like, let's face it. Conformity can be, like, super annoying.  When everyone around you is trying to act the same, dress the same, and think the same, it's like, totally stifles creativity and individuality.  I mean, who wants to be just another face in the crowd, right? 

First of all, when people try to force you to conform, it's like, super limiting.  You can't express yourself freely, because you don't want to be seen as different or stand out.  And that's, like, totally not cool.  I mean, why can't we just be ourselves and not have to worry about what others think? 

And it's not just that, but when everyone's trying to conform, it's like, super hard to make new friends.  Like, if you're the only one who's not into the ""cool"" thing, it's hard to find people who actually get you.  And that's, like, super lonely.

"In recent years, the idea of a four-day work week has gained traction in an ever-increasing number of businesses and schools. Under this structure, employees and students would no longer work or attend classes for five days a week, but instead reduce the number of hours necessary for a full workload to four days per week. While some speculate that such a structure would increase productivity, there are still a number of areas that need to be considered before implementation.

When researching the effects of a four-day week, it is important to look at both the potential benefits and the responsibilities that come with it. For businesses, a four-day work week could help save money on salary costs and overhead costs. Students may also see an uptick in their academic and social performance, as the extra day off could lead to improved focus while in class and offer time to participate in other activities, such as athletics, and contribute to hobbies outside of class. However, a four-day school week would also mean longer days for students.

Though reducing the workweek from five to four days could potentially benefit both businesses and students, it is important to fully analyze the potential effects of a four-day school week. It is necessary to consider both the positive and negative consequences of such a change, along with its impacts on the environment, in order to determine if it truly could benefit students both in and outside of school.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Becoming a professional makeup artist requires a combination of specialized training, education, and experience. By partnering with local companies, students can explore the art of being a makeup artist while accessing hands-on training and opportunities.

Taking courses in makeup artistry can help improve a student’s personal social health in a variety of ways. For example, students can learn the proper techniques for applying cosmetics, how to choose the right products, and how to stay up to date on the latest beauty trends. Additionally, the courses can help people to learn how to take care of their hair, do their makeup, and dress appropriately - all of which are essential skills for a successful career in makeup artistry.

At a personal level, students can benefit from increased confidence as they learn various skills related to makeup and styling. They can also improve their communication skills through interacting with others and teaching skills they’ve acquired. Finally, taking courses in makeup artistry can help build relationships with other professionals in the industry, opening up more opportunities in the future.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research outdoor activities in my area and compare them based on cost, time commitment, and fun. I also had to think about why spending time with friends outdoors is so enjoyable and how they can make me feel comfortable. Here's what I found out:

First of all, there are so many cool outdoor activities to do in my area! You can go hiking, biking, kayaking, or even rock climbing. Each of these activities has its own cost, but they're all pretty affordable. Hiking is free, biking can be around $20 for a rental, kayaking is around $30 for a half-day trip, and rock climbing is around $40 for a session. So, it's pretty easy to find something that fits your budget.

The time commitment for each activity can also vary. Hiking can be as short as an hour or as long as a whole day, depending on how far you want to go. Biking and kayaking are usually around 2-3 hours long, and rock climbing can be anywhere from 1-2 hours. So, you can choose how much time you want to dedicate to each activity.

But the best part about spending time with friends outdoors is how fun it is! Being in nature and doing something adventurous with your friends can be so much more enjoyable than just hanging out at home. You get to explore new places, challenge yourselves, and push your limits. Plus, you get to spend time with your friends and make memories that will last a lifetime.

And let's not forget how spending time with friends outdoors can make you feel comfortable. When you're doing something you love with people you care about, it's easy to forget about your worries and just enjoy the moment. You can talk about anything and everything, and just be yourself. It's like a big ol' stress relief.

So, in conclusion, spending time with friends outdoors is super fun and beneficial. It's a great way to get some exercise, explore new places, and spend time with the people you care about. And, let's be real, it's just a",1,llama2_chat,3
"No matter how hard life may become, or how much it seems like you have been mastered in something, it is important to remember that it’s important to never give up. The people that do give up end up regretting it, while those who keep persevering can achieve the success they always wanted. 

Take the example of YouTube star, Pewdiepie, for example. Before his stardom, Pewdiepie felt like he had been defeated by the world. His attempts at pursuing a higher education were thwarted, and he felt he had nowhere to go with his life. But Pewdiepie refused to give up. Instead, he pooled his resources to start his own YouTube channel, and went to work. Through hard work, dedication, and a commitment to staying true to himself, he has since become the most subscribed YouTube channel in the world, amassing 86 million subscribers.

Another example of why people should not give up even when they feel they can’t go on lies in the inspiring story of Jim Carrey. Before achieving fame, Carrey was living in poverty. He could be found sleeping in his van or sending messages to casting agents at night. He didn’t allow his older circumstance to dictate his own future. In the end, Carrey became one of the most successful and acclaimed actors of all time.

These inspiring stories show that no matter how dire a situation may seem, it is important to never give up. People who have the courage to keep going, no matter what, are always able to reach great successes that they couldn’t have imagined reaching before. So, keep pushing through and tackling life head on. You never know what amazing opportunities and successes might be waiting for you in the future.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Knowledge is often referred to as the key to success, and it’s true – knowledge can open many doors, giving us access to unique opportunities in life. While imagination can be important in coming up with creative ideas, knowledge is the essential ingredient in taking action on those ideas. It is knowledge that allows us to make decisions, solve complex problems and develop plans of action.

Imagination allows us to visualize possibilities and dream up creative solutions to problems, but this is only the first half of success. We need knowledge to make our dreams a reality. Knowledge of the world around us and the various systems at work in society gives us the power to turn creative ideas into tangible plans of action.

The ability to effectively utilize knowledge also gives us the capacity to identify risks and think ahead. Knowledge can help us to create strategies for navigating the complexity of the world around us, keeping us one step ahead of our competitors and giving us an edge in our respective industries. Knowledge is thus a fundamental tool for growth and success.

In the end, we can see why knowledge is more important than imagination. Imagination is essential to giving us the ideas and visions that can shape our lives, but it is knowledge that gives us the capacity to carry out those ideas. Thus, without knowledge, our dreams will remain just that – dreams. Only when combined with knowledge can our ideas become reality.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey there!  So, I know this might sound kinda weird, but I think it's super important that we don't use our smartphones in classrooms. Like, at all. And I'm not alone in this opinion, right? I mean, have you seen how much stuff gets lost in translation when we're all staring at our phones during lessons? It's like, we're not even present in the classroom anymore!

First of all, let's talk about how it affects our learning. When we're constantly on our phones, we're not paying attention to what the teacher is saying. And let's be real, teachers are the experts, so we should be listening to them! But when we're not paying attention, we're not retaining any of the information, which means we're not learning anything new. And that's not cool.

But it's not just about learning. It's also about how it affects our relationships with our classmates. When we're all on our phones, we're not interacting with each other. We're not making eye contact, we're not sharing ideas, we're not even talking about our weekends! It's like, we're missing out on all this important social interaction that's essential for our mental health and well-being.

And let's not forget about how it affects our parents. I mean, they're the ones who are paying for our education, right? So it's only fair that we keep them in the loop about what's going on in school. But when we're all on our phones, we're not even talking to them! It's like, they're just left in the dark about what's happening, and that's not cool either.

So, what can we do about it? Well, first of all, we need to be more mindful of how we're using our phones in class. Like, if we need to look something up, we should ask the teacher for help instead of just pulling out our phones. And if we need to communicate with our parents, we should do it in a way that's respectful and consider",1,llama2_chat,1
"Small acts of kindness can make a big impact on someone's life. It can improve their attitude, make their day better, help them become a better person, and help them through hard times. When we show kindness to others, we are not only helping them, but also ourselves.

Firstly, small acts of kindness can improve someone's attitude. When we show kindness to others, we are acknowledging their worth and value. This can help them feel appreciated and loved, which can improve their mood and outlook on life. For example, if someone is feeling down, a small act of kindness such as a compliment or a smile can brighten their day.

Secondly, small acts of kindness can make someone's day better. Even the smallest gesture of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. For example, if someone is having a bad day at work, a small act of kindness such as bringing them coffee or offering to help them with a task can make their day better.

Thirdly, small acts of kindness can help someone become a better person. When we show kindness to others, we are setting an example for them to follow. This can help them develop a more compassionate and empathetic attitude. For example, if someone witnesses someone being kind to someone else, they may be more likely to show kindness themselves in the future.

Finally, small acts of kindness can help someone going through hard times. When we show kindness to others, we are providing them with a sense of support and comfort. This can be especially helpful for someone going through a difficult time. For example, if someone is grieving the loss of a loved one, a small act of kindness such as a sympathetic ear or a hug can provide them with the emotional support they need.

In conclusion, small acts of kindness can benefit both the person being shown kindness and the person showing kindness. When we show kindness to others, we are acknowledging their worth and value, making their day better, helping them become a better person, and providing them with emotional support. It is important to remember that even the smallest gesture of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Working in a group can be a valuable experience for students. It provides numerous benefits that can help individuals achieve their goals and make new friends.

One of the most significant advantages of working in a group is the opportunity to meet new people. By working with a diverse group of individuals, students can learn about different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives. This exposure can broaden their horizons and help them develop a more inclusive worldview. Additionally, working in a group can provide a platform for students to make new friends and build relationships with people they may not have met otherwise.

Another benefit of working in a group is the potential for a better grade. When students work together, they can share ideas, resources, and expertise to complete a task. This collaboration can lead to a higher quality product and a better understanding of the material. Moreover, group work can help students develop important skills such as communication, problem-solving, and leadership, which can be valuable in many aspects of life.

Finally, working in a group can be a fun and enjoyable experience. When students work together, they can share their interests and hobbies, and engage in activities that they may not have enjoyed alone. This can create a positive and supportive environment that can help students feel more engaged and motivated to complete their work.

In conclusion, working in a group can bring numerous benefits to students. It provides an opportunity to meet new people, achieve a better grade, and make new friends. By embracing group work, students can develop important skills and have a more enjoyable and fulfilling academic experience.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have faced many pressures in my life that have shaped my behaviors and attitudes. These pressures have come from various sources, including family, friends, school, and society as a whole.

One of the biggest pressures I have faced is the expectation to conform to societal norms and expectations. This pressure has come from various sources, including my family, teachers, and peers. For example, my parents have always emphasized the importance of getting good grades and going to college, which has led me to feel like I need to follow this path to be successful. This pressure has caused me to prioritize my studies and put aside other interests that I may have had.

Another pressure I have faced is the pressure to be kind and repay debts. This pressure has come from my family, friends, and teachers. For example, my parents have always emphasized the importance of being kind to others and helping those in need. This pressure has caused me to prioritize helping others and making sure that I am repaying any debts that I owe.

However, I have also learned that it is important to differentiate between internal desires and external pressures. This means being able to identify what is truly important to me and what is just a result of external pressures. For example, while my parents have emphasized the importance of going to college, I have realized that this may not be the path for me. Instead, I may want to pursue a different career path that aligns with my internal desires.

In addition to differentiating between internal desires and external pressures, I have also found inspiration in the words of Dr. Seuss. Dr. Seuss's stories have taught me the importance of being true to myself and following my own path. For example, in ""Oh, the Places You'll Go!"", Dr. Seuss encourages readers to explore new things and not be afraid to take risks. This wisdom has inspired me to try new things and not be afraid to take risks in my life.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to reflect on the pressures faced in life and how they may have shaped our behaviors and attitudes. It is also important to differentiate between internal desires and external pressures so that we can start to forge our own identity. Finally, the wisdom of Dr. Seuss can be applied to our",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grader, I believe that having friendly relationships and support networks can greatly impact a person's first impression. A person's first impression is often based on their initial interactions with others, and these interactions can be influenced by their social skills, confidence, and overall demeanor. However, having a strong support network and making an effort to be friendly can help to change a person's first impression in a positive way.

Firstly, having a strong support network can help to boost a person's self-esteem and confidence. When a person has a group of friends or family members who care about them and are there to support them, they are more likely to feel comfortable in their own skin. This increased confidence can be reflected in their interactions with others, making them appear more friendly and approachable.

Secondly, making an effort to be friendly can also help to change a person's first impression. Being friendly involves being approachable, engaging in conversation, and showing genuine interest in others. When a person makes an effort to be friendly, they are more likely to make a positive first impression on others. This can be especially important in situations where a person is meeting new people, such as at a school event or in a new community.

In addition to boosting self-esteem and making a positive first impression, having a strong support network and being friendly can also help to reduce stress and improve mental health. When a person has a group of people who care about them and are there to support them, they are more likely to feel less alone and more able to cope with life's challenges. This can be especially important during times of stress or adversity, as having a strong support network can help to keep a person grounded and focused.

In conclusion, I believe that having friendly relationships and support networks can greatly impact a person's first impression. By boosting self-esteem and confidence, making a positive first impression, reducing stress, and improving mental health, having a strong support network and being friendly can help to change a person's first impression in a positive way. It is important for individuals to make an effort to be friendly and to build strong relationships with those around them, as these relationships can have a lasting impact on their overall well-being and success.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Okay, here is my essay response:

Adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day could have some pretty big implications for students. At first, it might seem like a good idea, getting more learning time in and all that. But when you really think about it, it could actually have some negative effects.

For one thing, it could mess with our performance. I mean, let's be real, we're already struggling to stay awake during some of our classes as it is. Adding more time to the day could make it even harder to focus and learn new things. And what about extracurricular activities? We already have a lot of stuff going on after school, like sports and clubs and stuff. Adding more time to the day could make it even harder to fit everything in.

And don't even get me started on how it could affect our relationships with our families and peers. I mean, my parents are already pretty strict about how much time I spend on my phone and stuff after school. If I had to be at school for an extra hour and a half, they might start to get even more worried about how much time I'm spending on my phone and stuff. And what about my friends? We already have a hard time finding time to hang out and do things together. Adding more time to the day could make it even harder to schedule stuff with them.

And finally, there's the thing about the local school district. They might not be able to afford adding more time to the day. Like, they might have to cut back on other things, like hiring more teachers or getting new textbooks. And that could have even more negative effects on our learning.

So yeah, while adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day might seem like a good idea at first, it could actually have some pretty big drawbacks. It's not like it's going to make us smarter or anything. And it could definitely make things harder for us in the long run.",1,llama2_chat,4
"As an eighth-grader, I believe that character traits play a crucial role in our lives. They define who we are and how we interact with others. Choosing the right character traits can be beneficial in many ways, including personal growth, success, and happiness.

One of the most important character traits is integrity. Integrity refers to being honest and having strong moral principles. People with integrity are trustworthy and reliable, and they always do the right thing, even when it's difficult. By choosing to be honest and ethical, we can build strong relationships with others and gain their respect. Furthermore, having integrity can help us make better decisions and avoid getting into trouble.

Another important character trait is perseverance. Perseverance refers to the ability to keep working hard even when things get tough. People with perseverance are determined and don't give up easily. By choosing to persevere, we can overcome obstacles and achieve our goals. Furthermore, having perseverance can help us develop resilience and become stronger in the face of adversity.

"Title: The Impact of Extending the School Day on Student Attendance, Grades, and Educational Life in Afghanistan

Introduction:

In recent years, there has been a growing debate on the length of the school day. Some argue that extending the school day would have a positive impact on student attendance, grades, and educational life, while others argue that it would have a negative impact. This essay will explore the impact of extending the school day two hours on student attendance, grades, and educational life in Afghanistan.

Student Attendance:

In Afghanistan, student attendance is a major issue. According to the World Bank, only 52% of children in Afghanistan attend primary school. This low attendance rate can be attributed to various factors, including poverty, conflict, and lack of infrastructure. However, extending the school day could potentially increase student attendance. By providing more time for students to attend school, they would have more opportunities to learn and improve their grades, which could motivate them to attend school more regularly.

Grades:

Extending the school day could also have a positive impact on student grades. In Afghanistan, the academic year is typically shorter than in other countries, with only 220 school days per year. This shortened school year can make it difficult for students to keep up with the curriculum and maintain their grades. By providing more time for students to learn and study, they would have a better chance of maintaining or improving their grades.

Educational Life:

In addition to attendance and grades, extending the school day could also have a positive impact on the overall educational life of students in Afghanistan. By providing more time for students to learn and study, they would have a better chance of developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These skills are essential for success in the modern world and can help students prepare for future careers.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, extending the school day two hours could potentially have a positive impact on student attendance, grades, and educational life in Afghanistan. While there may be some challenges associated with extending the school day, the potential benefits make it a worthwhile consideration. By providing more time for students to learn and study, we can help ensure that they have the best possible chance of success in the future.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

First of all, when we fail, it's easy to get all down on ourselves and think that we're, like, totally not good enough or something.  But the thing is, failure is just a part of life, you know? Everyone fails sometimes, even like, really successful people!  And the more we try and fail, the more chances we have to learn and grow and get better. 

So, instead of giving up when we fail, we should be like, ""Okay, cool, I didn't do so hot this time. But I'm gonna keep trying until I get it right!""  And that's where the second chance comes in.  See, when we fail, we should give ourselves a chance to try again, to learn from our mistakes and do better next time. 

Like, think about it. If you're trying to learn how to play a new sport or instrument, you're gonna mess up a lot at first.  But you don't give up, right? You keep practicing and practicing until you get it down. And that's how you get better!  It's the same with anything in life. We might fail at something, but if we keep trying and learning, we can succeed in the end. 

So, in conclusion, it's super important to always give yourself a chance to succeed and to not be afraid to fail.  Because failure is just a part of life, and it's how we learn and grow.

"When it comes to completing a task, people may have various preferences on whether to work in a group or alone. Working in a group can have many advantages; work can be shared more evenly, there is potential for more innovative ideas, and it can be a more social and enjoyable task. On the other hand, working alone can also have its own advantages such as allowing one to focus and stay focused on the job, and ensuring that all the responsibility is solely on the individual. 

When it comes to workload, working in a group has the potential to be more efficient due to sharing workloads and having several minds on the same task. On the other hand, when working alone, an individual will have to carry the entire workload and manage their own time and motivations. 

In terms of fun, working in a group has greater potential for being enjoyable and entertaining. Having people to work with and trade ideas off of can be seen as a benefit. Conversely, when one works alone, there is a greater chance for boredom and disconnection from the task. 

When it comes to ideas, working in a group allows for more creative freedom due to the helpful insight and ideas from others. There is also potential to build off of one another’s ideas. With having all the responsibility solely resting on one’s shoulders when working alone, there can be pressure that limits creative thinking. 

In terms of focus, working alone can be important as it allows the individual to settle in and stay on task without potential distractions from others. Conversely, when working in a group, it can be possible for one’s focus to be shifted and diluted as working in a group is an interactive process. 

In conclusion, there are clear advantages and disadvantages of both working in a group and working alone. Whether one chooses to work in a group or alone ultimately depends upon the task at hand and the individual’s preferences.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"When we encounter difficult obstacles and challenges in life, it is beneficial to seek advice and guidance from experts and authorities. In these matters, having knowledge and experience can be extremely valuable. Experts can provide us with the perspective we need to have a successful outcome in our lives. They can provide us with the guidance to help us succeed, to be able to move on after a failure or setback, and to know when we need to ask for help. 

By seeking out guidance from those who have been through similar experiences, we can assess our own situation objectively and understand the best way to move forward. Experts can provide a variety of life strategies to help us navigate the tough terrain of life. They can analyze our struggles, offer advice and provide resources that can assist us in getting to our desired goal. They can provide insight on how to approach problems and how to navigate the big and small decisions we make.

In addition to providing us with strategies to succeed, experts can also give us the emotional support and encouragement that we need. Through these relationships with experts, we can build the resilience and confidence we need to overcome setbacks and gain a sense of personal empowerment.

Ultimately, seeking input from experts and authorities in life's important matters can be invaluable. Advice and guidance from those who have the experience and knowledge to help us can be crucial in pushing us forward and helping us achieve our goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Failure is an important part of success. Without experiencing failure, we cannot recognize how to identify and mitigate the risks associated with taking chances. It is only after making mistakes that we can learn the necessary lessons needed to overcome challenges and achieve success. 

For example, Thomas Edison famously failed multiple times while working on the light bulb before eventually achieving success. His famous quote ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work"" encapsulates the importance of failure in learning and achieving success. Similarly, people who are successful in sports or business can often point to an experience that seemed like a failure, but ended up teaching them a valuable lesson.

Ultimately, failure can be the key to unlocking success in life. It gives us opportunities to learn and grow, and allows us to unlock our true potential. By embracing failure and taking risks, we can put ourselves in a much better position to succeed.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Excerpt: 
In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of attending a regular school versus distance learning. On one hand, attending a regular school allows students to be immersed in a traditional school environment where they can build relationships with peers, access valuable resources and get help from teachers. On the other hand, distance learning offers students the flexibility to create their own schedule, the ability to complete coursework without having to leave home, and with the freedom to attend from anywhere. 

A real-life example of how beneficial attending a regular school can be is that of Mary, a high school senior living in rural Michigan. She was determined to make the most of her school experience and took full advantage of all of the resources her school had to offer. Through her classes, clubs, and activities, she was able to challenge herself academically, learn valuable information about college, meet new people, and develop her strengths and passions. Without the traditional structure of a regular school, none of these opportunities would have been available to Mary. 

At a regular school, students are able to participate in a wide range of clubs, sports, and activities, such as band, theater, robotics, and more. These encourage students to build social skills, develop their talents, and explore different interests. Additionally, schools often have access to additional learning resources and materials, such as libraries, computers, tutoring programs, and specialized courses, that are not available to students enrolled in distance learning.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

1. Types of Music on a Piano

The piano is a versatile instrument that can be used to play a wide range of music styles. Some of the most popular types of music played on a piano include classical, jazz, pop, and rock. Classical music is often played on the piano because of its ability to produce rich, complex harmonies and melodies. Jazz music is also commonly played on the piano, as it allows for improvisation and spontaneity. Pop and rock music can also be played on the piano, as it provides a solid foundation for rhythm and harmony.

2. Types of Music on a Saxophone

The saxophone is a woodwind instrument that is commonly used in jazz music. It is also used in some forms of pop and rock music. The saxophone has a unique sound that is often described as mellow and smooth. Some of the most popular types of music played on the saxophone include bebop, cool jazz, and smooth jazz. Bebop is a fast-paced and complex style of jazz that is often played on the saxophone. Cool jazz is a more relaxed and melodic style of jazz that is often played on the saxophone. Smooth jazz is a more commercial and accessible style of jazz that is often played on the saxophone.

3. Differences between Acoustic, Distorted, and Clean Guitar

The guitar is a stringed instrument that can be played in a variety of styles, including rock, pop, country, and folk. There are three main types of guitars: acoustic, distorted, and clean. An acoustic guitar is played without any amplification, while a distorted guitar is played through an amplifier with a distortion effect. A clean guitar is played through an amplifier without any distortion.

Acoustic guitars are best suited for playing folk, country, and pop music. Distorted guitars are commonly used in rock and metal music, as they provide a powerful and heavy sound. Clean guitars are often used in pop and rock music, as they provide a clean and clear sound.

No one will be successful in a field that they have no interest or passion in. Having the drive to pursue something you are passionate about is invaluable; never let anyone tell you otherwise.

Humor and laughter can also provide a great source of motivation when working in a group. Having someone to joke and laugh with can inspire creativity and help to develop a strong sense of camaraderie in the group.

So, here's what I found out: Pharmacists are like, superheroes of the medical world. They work in drugstores, hospitals, and even clinics, and their main job is to dispense medication to people.  Like, they make sure the right medicine goes to the right person at the right time. They also give advice on how to take the medication and what side effects to look out for. 

But that's not all! Pharmacists also help doctors and other healthcare professionals by giving them advice on the best medication for their patients. They also do research on new medications and make sure they're safe for use.

"As high school students, we are constantly bombarded with information about our future. We are told to aim for a four-year college degree, but what if we could achieve that goal one year earlier? In this essay, I will argue that graduating in three years as opposed to the traditional four years has numerous advantages for high school students in terms of career, family, and financial freedom.

First, graduating in three years can lead to a more promising career path. Many employers value candidates who are well-rounded and have a diverse range of experiences. By graduating in three years, students have the opportunity to take on internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer work while still in high school. These experiences can provide valuable skills and knowledge that can be applied to their future careers. Additionally, graduating one year earlier can give students a head start on their college applications, as many colleges and universities look favorably on students who have completed their coursework early.

Second, graduating in three years can also have a positive impact on a student's family. Many families struggle financially, and sending a child to college can be a significant expense. By graduating in three years, students can save money on tuition and fees, as well as on living expenses. This can help alleviate some of the financial burden on families and allow them to allocate their resources more effectively. Additionally, graduating early can free up time for students to contribute to their families, whether it be through part-time jobs or by taking on more household responsibilities.

Finally, graduating in three years can provide students with greater financial freedom. Many students graduate from high school with significant debt, which can limit their ability to make financial decisions and pursue their dreams. By graduating early, students can reduce their debt and have more money available to them. This can allow them to start their careers on a stronger financial footing and make more informed decisions about their future.

In conclusion, graduating in three years as opposed to the traditional four years has numerous advantages for high school students in terms of career, family, and financial freedom. By taking advantage of the opportunities available to them, students can set themselves up for success and achieve their goals more quickly. It is important for high school students to consider this option and weigh the benefits against the traditional four-year college path.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Distance learning has been gaining traction in recent years as an alternative to traditional in-person classes for students. While distance learning certainly has its advantages, such as the ability to learn from the comfort of home and increased flexibility with time management, there are also disadvantages which inevitably come with it. One of the primary downsides is the lack of the social aspect of traditional schooling, which can lead to increased stress levels and a lack of motivation for many students. 

Fortunately, there are ways which educators can accommodate different types of learners. For instance, breaking up lectures with virtual online “room” discussions is an effective way to promote collaboration and communication between students. Furthermore, introducing more interactive elements such as small-group presentations could help reduce the stress of distance learning and help motivate students to stay committed to their courses. Overall, both distance learning and in-person classes have their share of advantages and disadvantages, and in order to find the best option for any particular student, it’s important to carefully consider the available options.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Ralph Waldo Emerson, an American essayist and philosopher, is known for his emphasis on the importance of thinking before doing. In his essay ""Self-Reliance,"" Emerson argues that individuals should not blindly follow the herd, but rather should develop their own unique perspectives and values. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of financial decision-making, where it is crucial to carefully consider the implications of one's actions before making a decision.

Emerson believed that individuals should not rely on external sources of validation or approval, but rather should trust their own intuition and judgment. This is particularly important in financial decision-making, where it is easy to be swayed by the opinions of others or by the latest trends and fashions. For example, an individual may be tempted to invest in a particular stock or asset simply because it is popular or has been recommended by a friend or financial advisor, without fully considering the potential risks and rewards.

To avoid making hasty decisions, it is important to take the time to carefully research and analyze the available information. This may involve seeking out multiple perspectives and opinions, and considering the potential consequences of one's actions. For example, before making a major financial decision, an individual may want to consult with a financial advisor or do their own research to gain a better understanding of the market and the potential risks and rewards of different options.

Emerson also emphasized the importance of self-discipline and self-control in achieving one's goals. This is particularly relevant in financial decision-making, where it is important to resist the temptation to make impulsive or reckless decisions. For example, an individual may be tempted to spend more money than they can afford or to take on too much debt in the pursuit of short-term gains, without considering the long-term consequences.

In conclusion, the concept of thinking before doing, as emphasized by Ralph Waldo Emerson, is particularly relevant in the context of financial decision-making. By carefully considering the available information, seeking out multiple perspectives, and exercising self-discipline and self-control, individuals can make more informed and thoughtful decisions that will help them achieve their financial goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on comparing and contrasting the benefits of working with a group and working alone.

Working with a group and working alone both have their own benefits, but I think working with a group is way better. When you work with a group, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with way more creative solutions than you could on your own. Plus, you can divide tasks and work on them simultaneously, which makes the project way faster. For example, when my friends and I did that science fair project last semester, we split up the tasks and worked together, and we got an honorable mention!

But, working alone has its benefits too. When you work alone, you can focus on one thing at a time, and you don't have to worry about anyone else's ideas or opinions. Plus, you can work at your own pace, so you can take as much time as you need to get something done. For example, when I did that art project for my social studies class, I worked alone, and I was able to add all the little details that made it look really cool.

I think the best way to work is with a group, but with some alone time too. That way, you can get the benefits of both worlds. When you work with a group, you can brainstorm together and come up with really cool ideas, but when you work alone, you can focus on the details and make sure everything is perfect.

In conclusion, working with a group and working alone both have their own benefits, but I think working with a group is way better. You can bounce ideas off each other and work on tasks simultaneously, which makes the project way faster and more fun. But, it's also important to have some alone time to focus on details and make sure everything is perfect.

Thanks, Mrs. Johnson!

"As an 8th grader, I have learned about the many contributions of people in the past who have shaped society in significant ways. One example that stands out to me is the inventions of the Industrial Revolution.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, people like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell revolutionized the way goods were produced and transported. They invented machines like the steam engine and the telephone, which greatly increased efficiency and productivity. These inventions allowed for the mass production of goods, leading to a significant increase in the standard of living for many people. Without the inventions of the Industrial Revolution, it's likely that society would be much different today.

However, I also understand that inactivity can have a negative impact on society. For example, if people in the past had been inactive and not contributed to society, we may not have the same level of technological advancements that we do today. This could have led to a slower pace of progress and a lower standard of living for many people.

In the present, it's important for people to continue to contribute to society in order to shape a better future for the generations to come. This can be done through innovation and hard work, as well as by staying informed and engaged in current events. By staying active and involved, we can ensure that society continues to progress and improve.

One way that people can contribute to society is by pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). These fields are crucial for driving innovation and advancing technology, and there is currently a high demand for skilled professionals in these areas. By pursuing a career in STEM, individuals can make a significant impact on society and help shape the future.

Another way to contribute to society is through volunteer work and community service. By giving back to the community and helping those in need, individuals can make a positive impact on society and create a better world for everyone.

In conclusion, people in the past have made significant contributions to society through their inventions and innovations. However, inactivity can also have a negative impact on society. In the present, it's important for people to continue to contribute to society through innovation, hard work, and community service in order to shape a better future for the generations",1,llama2_chat,4
"Hey there!  I'm super excited to write this essay about failure and success, even though I'm not the best at writing . So, let's dive right in!

The quote by Winston Churchill is totally true – failure is like, totally essential for success!  I mean, think about it. If we never failed, we wouldn't learn anything new or improve ourselves. It's like, how are we supposed to get better at anything if we don't mess up sometimes? 

Like, I totally failed my math test last week, but you know what? I'm gonna use that as an opportunity to learn and do better next time!  It's like, the more we fail, the more we know what we need to work on, you know? And that's how we become better at stuff! 

But, you know, it's not just about learning new things. Failure can also be really hard, and it can make us feel super down and stuff.  Like, I totally failed my best friend's birthday party last month, and I felt so bad!  But, you know what? My friend didn't get mad at me or anything. She just laughed it off and said, ""Oh, no worries! We'll just have to try again next year!""  And that's when it hit me – failure isn't the end of the world! 

So, how can we maintain enthusiasm throughout the process of failing and learning?  Well, I think it's important to have a growth mindset. Like, instead of getting discouraged when we fail, we should see it as a chance to grow and improve.  And, you know, it's also important to have a good support system.  When we have people around us who believe in us and encourage us, it makes it way easier to keep going even when things get tough. 

In conclusion, failure is totally essential for success!  It's like, the more we fail, the more we",1,llama2_chat,0
"The statement ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" is a common belief that suggests that problems are opportunities for growth and improvement. However, this view is not entirely accurate, as there are many examples of people who fail to learn from their mistakes and how their problems have already affected them. Additionally, the best way to succeed in life is by making fewer mistakes.

Firstly, there are many people who fail to learn from their mistakes. For instance, a person who consistently fails to learn from their mistakes may continue to make the same mistakes repeatedly, leading to a cycle of failure. This can be seen in the case of a student who consistently fails a particular subject, despite receiving numerous warnings and opportunities to improve. In this case, the student may not have learned from their mistakes and may continue to struggle in the subject.

Secondly, problems can have a significant impact on a person's life. For example, a person who has experienced financial difficulties may struggle to regain their footing, even after the problem has been resolved. Similarly, a person who has experienced a personal loss may struggle to move on, even after the loss has been resolved. In these cases, the problems have already affected the person, and it may be challenging to overcome them.

Finally, the best way to succeed in life is by making fewer mistakes. This is because making fewer mistakes means that a person is more likely to achieve their goals and objectives. For example, a person who consistently makes mistakes in their work may struggle to advance in their career, while a person who consistently performs well may be more likely to receive promotions and other opportunities.

In conclusion, while problems can be opportunities for growth and improvement, there are many examples of people who fail to learn from their mistakes and how their problems have already affected them. Additionally, the best way to succeed in life is by making fewer mistakes. Therefore, it is essential to learn from our mistakes and work towards making fewer of them in order to achieve our goals and objectives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1

"Summer vacations are an important part of the academic calendar for students all over the world. They provide an opportunity to take a break from the routine of studying and take part in activities that are both familiar and new. During this time, students have more opportunities for finding jobs and working, providing a valuable learning experience. Summer vacations also serve to balance students’ personal and school lives, allowing them to take part in spaces and experiences outside of their typical academic environment. 

In order to maximize the benefit of summer vacations, it is important for students to find an appropriate length of break. Too short of a break may lead to students having difficulty re-entering the academic headspace and can leave them feeling overwhelmed. On the other hand, too long of a break can disrupt the momentum that students have built, leading to a slower transition back into the academic setting. Finding a balance that provides enough time away while also allowing students to feel mentally refreshed when it’s time to go back to work is essential. 

Overall, summer vacations provide an important time of respite and opportunity for students of all ages. They are beneficial for providing a balance between school and personal lives and can provide students with more job opportunities. Therefore, it is important for students to carefully consider the appropriate length of break needed in order to maximize their progress.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"The Importance of Career Planning for Teenagers

As an eighth-grade student, it is essential to begin thinking about my future career path. With the vast array of options available, it can be overwhelming to decide which one to pursue. However, by researching and discussing different career options and the skills necessary for pursuing them, I can make a more informed decision.

One aspect of career planning that is often overlooked is the existence of education systems in countries with limited resources. In some countries, students are forced to take a career chosen by their parents, rather than having the opportunity to explore their own interests. This can lead to a lack of fulfillment in their chosen career, as they may not have the passion or motivation to succeed.

In contrast, the United States provides unique opportunities to pursue different careers for teenagers. Our education system is designed to give students the freedom to explore their interests and choose a career path that aligns with their passions. This allows for a more fulfilling and successful career in the long run.

When considering a career, it is important to analyze the job opportunities with and without a good education. While some jobs may require a college degree, others may only require a high school diploma or even a vocational training program. It is essential to research the job market and determine which education level is necessary for the desired career path.

Teenagers should also think carefully about their future and how their parents can guide them in their decision-making process. While parents may have valuable insights and advice to offer, it is important for teenagers to take the lead in their career planning. By exploring different options and making an informed decision, teenagers can set themselves up for success in their chosen career.

In conclusion, career planning is an essential aspect of preparing for the future. By researching and discussing different career options and the skills necessary for pursuing them, teenagers can make a more informed decision. The United States provides unique opportunities to pursue different careers for teenagers, and it is essential to take advantage of these opportunities to set oneself up for success in the long run.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how first impressions can change over time and how important it is to be understanding and respectful of others.

So, like, have you ever met someone and they totally judged you based on one little thing you did or said, and then later on you get to know them and you're like, ""Wow, they're actually really cool""? That's what I'm gonna talk about.

One time, I was in my math class and this new kid started sitting next to me. He was really quiet and didn't say much, so I was like, ""Okay, he's probably gonna be a weirdo."" But then, like, a few weeks later, we were working on a project together and he was actually really helpful and nice. I was like, ""Whoa, I was totally wrong about him!""

Another time, my teacher gave me a new partner for a project and I was like, ""Ugh, why did she have to give me the weird kid from the back of the class?"" But then, like, we started working together and he was actually really smart and funny. I was like, ""Dang, I'm glad I gave him a chance.""

So, my point is, don't judge people based on one thing you see or hear. Give them a chance to show you who they really are. Because, like, you might be surprised.

And, like, it's important to be understanding and respectful of others. Don't be mean or rude to someone just because you don't know them. Everyone has their own struggles and stuff, so just be kind and stuff.

So, yeah, that's my essay. I hope you liked it. Thanks for reading!",1,llama2_chat,4
"""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"" is a statement attributed to Winston Churchill which speaks of the important role failure plays in eventual success. My personal experience serves to illustrate Churchill's point - despite failing out of college twice, I ultimately returned with renewed focus and eventually earned my degree. Similarly, I persevered in the face of other failures - while my first few businesses did not succeed, I eventually established a successful business venture. Churchill's statement that ""failure is not fatal"" is true for three main reasons: first, it is often saying that failure is an opportunity to learn and grow; second, it is accepting failure as a part of life and understanding that it does not define an individual; and third, failure is the impetus for reflection and improvement. As the quote by Francis Bacon says, ""If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties"".",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey, so like, I know it's totally easy to get caught up in what other people think and do, you know? Like, everyone's always trying to fit in and be cool and stuff, and it's hard to resist the pressure to conform. But, like, I think it's super important to stay true to yourself and not let other people's opinions define who you are.

I mean, think about it. If you're always trying to be someone you're not, you're not really being yourself. And that's, like, totally not cool. You're basically pretending to be someone else, and that's just, like, so not authentic. And, like, who wants to be fake? Not me, that's for sure.

But, like, it's not just about being authentic. It's also about being true to your own beliefs and values. Like, if you're into something that's not super popular, it can be hard to stand up for it when everyone else is like, ""Oh, my gosh, that's so lame."" But, like, if you really believe in it, you should totally stand up for it and not let other people bring you down.

And, like, it's not just in little things like that. It's, like, in big things too. Like, if you're passionate about a certain cause or issue, it can be hard to speak up when everyone else is like, ""Oh, my gosh, that's so boring."" But, like, if you really believe in it, you should totally speak up and make your voice heard.

So, like, yeah. It's totally important to stay true to yourself and not let other people define who you are. It's, like, hard sometimes, but it's totally worth it in the end. Because, like, when you're being yourself and standing up for what you believe in, you're being true to yourself, and that's, like, the best feeling ever.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Hey there!  So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole online learning thing, and I gotta say, it's pretty interesting. I mean, I've been doing it for a bit now, and it's been pretty cool. But, there are pros and cons, you know? 

First off, the pros.  One of the biggest advantages is that you can learn from the comfort of your own home. Like, no more waking up early for school, no more dealing with traffic, no more awkward lunchroom interactions.  You can just sit in your pajamas, grab a snack, and learn. It's like, super convenient. Plus, you can learn at your own pace. If you need more time to understand something, you can take it. If you're a super genius and can finish early, you can move on to the next thing. It's like, totally flexible.

But, there are also some cons.  One of the biggest ones is that you can get distracted easily. Like, your dog might come over and want attention, or your sibling might start arguing with you, or you might just get bored and start scrolling through TikTok.  It's hard to stay focused when you're at home, you know? And, sometimes the video quality can be really bad, and you can't see the teacher's face or the whiteboard very well. That can make it harder to learn.

So, should online learning be available for all students?  I think so.  I mean, it's like, a great option for people who have busy schedules or who live far away from school. Or, like, for people who are super introverted and find it hard to make friends in a traditional classroom setting.  It's like, a great way to learn in a way that's comfortable for you. But, I think it's important to have some in-person classes too, because you can learn from other people and get that face-to-face interaction. 

So, yeah. That's my take on online learning",1,llama2_chat,1
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of a four-day school week with ten-hour days:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about this crazy idea of having a four-day school week with ten-hour days. Like, I know it sounds cool at first, but let's think about it for real.

Okay, so the pros of this thing are that we'd have more time to do stuff on Fridays. Like, we could go to the mall or hang out with friends or something. And we'd have longer breaks between classes, so we could stretch our legs and get some fresh air. Plus, teachers could use that extra time to give us more help or teach us new stuff. That's cool, right?

But here's the thing. Ten hours a day is a long time. Like, it's a lot longer than the usual school day. And it's gonna be really hard to focus and learn stuff when we're so tired. Plus, our brains need breaks too, you know? And if we're in school for ten hours a day, we're not gonna have time to do other stuff we like, like sports or music or anything.

And what about our parents? They're gonna have to take care of us for longer hours too. Like, they might not be able to work as much, or they might have to find someone else to watch us. That could be expensive and stressful for them.

I don't know, guys. I think a four-day school week with ten-hour days might not be the best idea. It's like, we'd be getting more time off, but we'd also be missing out on other stuff. And our brains and bodies need rest too. So, I don't know. What do you guys think?

"Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay about the benefits of distance learning for students. 

First of all, let's talk about the advantages of attending classes online.  One of the biggest pros is that it allows students to learn at their own pace.  Like, if you're a super fast learner, you can speed through the coursework and move on to the next topic. Or, if you need a little extra time to grasp a concept, you can take breaks and come back to it whenever you want. It's like having your own personalized learning experience! 

Another cool thing about online learning is that you can learn from anywhere!  Like, you can do your schoolwork on the beach, or in your pajamas, or even while traveling.  It's like having the freedom to learn whenever and wherever you want! 

But,  there are also some disadvantages to distance learning.  One of the biggest cons is that it can be really hard to stay motivated.  Like, if you're not in a physical classroom, it's easy to get distracted and lose focus. And, if you don't have a good schedule, it can be hard to stay on track. 

Another thing is that you might miss out on social interactions.  Like, you don't get to hang out with your friends and classmates as much, which can be really tough for some people.  It's like, you're missing out on that face-to-face communication and collaboration. 

But,  there are ways to overcome these disadvantages!  Like, you can set up a dedicated study space, or join online communities to connect with other students.  It's like, you can still have that social interaction and motivation, even if you're learning online.

"Working in a group has many benefits that can outweigh working alone. Firstly, collaboration is key when completing a task. Having different ideas from other members of the group provides an opportunity to explore and to create a well-rounded outcome. Furthermore, working in a group allows multiple perspectives and approaches to be discussed and weighed up. The range of knowledge and expertise found in a group can lead to better decision making and a higher quality of work.

Communication is also improved when working as a team. Open dialogue and discussion can ensure that everyone is kept informed, and that any misunderstandings are quickly identified. Working in a group also allows tasks to be completed at a faster pace, with people able to specialise in certain areas or to take on specific roles.

Finally, working in a group facilitates understanding in ways that working alone does not. Members of the group can provide support and guidance, and help each other to grow in knowledge and skills. Working together can also create a sense of unity and solidarity that would not be possible in an individual setting.

In conclusion, working in a group can be hugely beneficial for many reasons, including collaboration, communication, faster work and improved understanding.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Asking for advice when making life decisions is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development. There are numerous benefits to seeking out the opinions of others, including cost effectiveness, having an outside perspective, and raising success rates. In contrast, not soliciting advice can lead to negative consequences, such as missed opportunities and poor decision-making.

One of the most significant advantages of seeking advice is cost effectiveness. By asking for the opinions of others, individuals can save money by avoiding costly mistakes. For example, if someone is considering starting a business, they may seek advice from experienced entrepreneurs to avoid common pitfalls and make informed decisions. Similarly, if someone is trying to make a major purchase, such as a car or home, seeking advice from friends or family members can help them make a more informed decision and potentially save money in the long run.

Another benefit of seeking advice is having an outside perspective. When making life decisions, it can be easy to become biased or tunnel-visioned. However, by seeking advice from others, individuals can gain a fresh perspective and potentially make more well-rounded decisions. For example, if someone is trying to decide on a career path, seeking advice from people in different fields can help them gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of various options.

Finally, seeking advice can raise success rates. By making informed decisions based on the opinions of others, individuals are more likely to succeed in their endeavors. For example, if someone is trying to start a business, seeking advice from experienced entrepreneurs can help them develop a solid business plan and increase their chances of success. Similarly, if someone is trying to improve their grades, seeking advice from a tutor or study group can help them develop better study habits and achieve better academic results.

On the other hand, not soliciting advice can lead to negative consequences. For example, if someone makes a decision without seeking advice, they may miss out on valuable insights and opportunities. Additionally, if someone is biased or tunnel-visioned, they may make poor decisions that could negatively impact their life. For example, if someone decides to invest all their money in one stock without seeking advice from a financial advisor, they may lose all their money if the stock performs poorly.

In conclusion, seeking advice when making life decisions is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development. It is cost effective, provides an outside perspective,",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Online classes, also known as e-learning or distance learning, have been gaining popularity in recent years as a way for students to access education remotely. While some people argue that online classes offer many advantages, others claim that they have several disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of online classes and how they could impact student life.

One of the main advantages of online classes is flexibility. Students can take classes from anywhere with an internet connection, at any time that suits them. This is especially useful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where traditional schools may not be available. Online classes also offer a more relaxed learning environment, as students can take breaks whenever they need to and work at their own pace.

Another advantage of online classes is cost-effectiveness. Online courses can be more affordable than traditional classes, as there are no commuting costs, no need to relocate, and sometimes lower tuition fees. This can be especially beneficial for students who come from low-income families or who are self-learning.

However, there are also several disadvantages to online classes. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of face-to-face interaction. Students miss out on the opportunity to connect with their peers and teachers, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Online classes can also be less engaging, as students may find it harder to stay motivated and focused without the structure of a traditional classroom.

Another disadvantage of online classes is the potential for technical issues. Students may experience connectivity problems, poor audio or video quality, and difficulties with navigation within the course platform. These issues can disrupt the learning experience and cause frustration for both students and teachers.

Despite these disadvantages, I believe that online classes have the potential to play a significant role in impacting student life. With the rise of remote work and online learning, it's becoming increasingly important for students to develop digital skills and learn how to navigate the online world. Online classes can provide students with the flexibility and convenience they need to balance their education with other responsibilities, such as work or family obligations.

"Having a positive attitude is often touted as a key to success, but is it really the only factor to consider in life? It is true that having an optimistic outlook has a range of benefits – it can make it easier to accomplish goals and build relationships – but there are also times when maintaining a neutral, or even negative, attitude is more relevant.

Going in with an overly-positive mindset can be counterproductive, as it may lead to unrealistic expectations and a frustrating lack of progress. With this situation, an individual may be too eager to believe that any obstacles can be easily overcome, when in reality additional challenges may be encountered. On the other hand, adopting a more practical and measured approach, one that does not involve ignoring potential roadblocks or issues, can allow an individual to remain calm and remain focused on their goal.

Having a negative attitude can also be damaging, as it is easy to become overwhelmed and disheartened. A pessimistic attitude is unlikely to lead to fruitful endeavors, as it can prevent an individual from taking risks or challenging themselves in worthwhile ways. Additionally, a pessimistic outlook can also tarnish relationships, making it difficult to form meaningful connections with those around you.

Ultimately, having the right balance between optimism and pessimism is key to finding success in life. It is important to recognize the potential risks and difficulties, but also have an underlying positive outlook which encourages progress. Identifying and creating for yourself a realistic, positive attitude which remains open minded to all possibilities is the best approach for finding success in any endeavour.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that partnership is crucial for learning. Working with others in a group setting can provide numerous benefits that can help us learn more effectively.

One of the most important aspects of partnership is the ability to discuss ideas and perspectives with others. When we work in groups, we are able to share our thoughts and ideas with others who may have different experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a more well-rounded understanding of the topic at hand, as we are able to consider multiple viewpoints and come to a more informed conclusion.

Another benefit of partnership is the ability to work together to solve problems. When we work in groups, we are able to pool our resources and knowledge to tackle a problem or task. This can lead to more creative and effective solutions, as we are able to draw on the strengths of each member of the group.

Partnership can also help us to develop important skills that will serve us well in the future. When we work in groups, we are able to learn how to communicate effectively, collaborate with others, and manage our time and resources. These skills are essential for success in school, work, and life in general.

In addition to the benefits of working in groups, partnership can also be beneficial for individual learning. When we work with a partner, we are able to provide each other with feedback and support. This can help us to identify areas where we need to improve and provide us with the motivation to continue learning.

In conclusion, partnership is an important aspect of learning that can provide numerous benefits. By working with others in a group setting, we can develop important skills, share ideas and perspectives, and work together to solve problems. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that partnership is essential for success in school and in life in general.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"In today's modern society, technology has had a lasting and positive impact. It has enabled us to be more connected than ever before, advancing communication and giving us access to vast amounts of information without ever having to leave home.

Social media platforms have also enabled people to connect with others both near and far. Beyond that, the use of technology can provide people with access to job opportunities and the tools they need to solve complex problems.

"Attitude refers to a person's perspective or outlook on something. It is a way of thinking or feeling towards something or someone, and it can greatly impact a person's life. In both English and Spanish, the concept of attitude is similar, but there are some differences in the way it is expressed.

In English, attitude is typically defined as a person's emotional state towards something or someone. It can be positive or negative, and it can be expressed through words, actions, and body language. For example, a person might have a positive attitude towards their job if they enjoy it and feel fulfilled by it. On the other hand, they might have a negative attitude towards their job if they feel stressed, unhappy, or unfulfilled.

In Spanish, the concept of attitude is also defined as a person's emotional state towards something or someone, but it is often expressed in a more formal way. For example, a person might have a ""buena atitud"" (good attitude) towards their job if they are happy and satisfied with it. On the other hand, they might have a ""mala atitud"" (bad attitude) towards their job if they are unhappy and dissatisfied with it.

Personally, I have experienced the impact of a negative attitude on my own life. When I was in middle school, I had a negative attitude towards school. I felt like I didn't understand the material and that I was constantly struggling to keep up with my classmates. This attitude caused me to become discouraged and unmotivated, which in turn led to poor grades and a lack of interest in learning. It wasn't until I started talking to my teachers and getting extra help that I was able to change my attitude towards school and start performing better.

In conclusion, attitude is an important concept that can greatly impact a person's life. Whether it is expressed in English or Spanish, it is essential to recognize the power of attitude and to strive for a positive outlook towards everything. By doing so, we can improve our grades, relationships, and overall well-being.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"After researching the effects of a school program that pairs older and younger students, I've come to the conclusion that this program is beneficial for both parties. The older students gain invaluable experience in teaching and leadership while the younger students benefit from the guidance, support, and encouragement of their elder peers. 

I remember participating in this type of pairing program in middle school. My younger partner and I would work together to complete class assignments. Although our age difference was noticeable, I was impressed by how quickly he learned and observed that having someone close to his own age to relate to and look up to made a real difference in his attitude and performance.

The advantages of this program go beyond academic success. It emphasizes the importance of kindness and cooperation, and exposes each child to a different age group and mindset. Most importantly, it is a reminder to both parties that everyone has something to contribute, no matter how different they may be.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Art classes have been a staple of high school education for many years, and they continue to be a popular option for students of all ages. But what exactly are the benefits of art classes, and how do they compare to other subjects? In this essay, I will explore the range of art classes available to high school students, the ways that art classes can help students relieve stress and improve their ability to absorb new information, and the benefits and drawbacks of making art classes mandatory for all high school students. I will also examine the techniques for maintaining focus in art classes and compare them to techniques for focusing in more conventional academic classes. Finally, I will identify ways that students who are not interested in art classes can benefit from them.

First, let's take a look at the range of art classes that are available to high school students. There are many different types of art classes that students can choose from, including drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic design, and more. Some schools also offer specialized classes in areas such as digital art, ceramics, or textiles. These classes can be taken as standalone courses or as part of a larger art program.

Now, let's consider the ways that art classes can help students relieve stress and improve their ability to absorb new information. Research has shown that engaging in creative activities can help reduce stress and anxiety, as well as improve mood and overall well-being. In addition, art classes can provide a safe and supportive environment for students to express themselves and explore their own creativity. This can be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with other subjects or who have difficulty expressing themselves in more conventional ways.

One of the main benefits of art classes is that they can help students develop their ability to focus and concentrate. In order to create art, students must be able to maintain their attention and focus on the task at hand. This can be particularly challenging for students who struggle with attention deficit disorders or who have difficulty staying motivated in more conventional academic classes. By learning techniques for maintaining focus in art classes, students can also apply these skills to other areas of their lives.

Of course, there are also some potential drawbacks to making art classes mandatory for all high school students. For one thing, some students may not be interested in art or may not have the skills or talent to excel in these classes. In addition, making art classes mandatory could take away from other",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Math has been an integral part of my life ever since I can remember. From my days of elementary school learning arithmetic to college-level calculus, math has been essential when it comes to problem solving. 

Everyday math is used in a variety of places. For example, when at the store, we use basic math skills to add up the cost of items and ensure we are paying the correct amount. When it comes to car and house payments, we use mortgages and amortization to figure out the relevant payments and costs. Finally, when investing for retirement, we use basic statistics and probability to try and understand the odds of certain investments. 

In the future, math will be essential in helping us prepare for success. Being able to analyze problems using quantitative methods will give us an advantage in the work we do. Likewise, understanding fundamental concepts such as statistics and linear algebra will become increasingly valuable as data grows ever more important.

While some may see math as a chore, I believe that it holds many teachings that will prove valuable in our lives. Understanding the power and capabilities that math provides us will unlock opportunities that remained inaccessible otherwise. Ultimately, math should be viewed more as a tool than a burden.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Working in a group can be more advantageous than working alone in many ways. By collaborating together, group members can share ideas, thoughts, and resources to create more comprehensive and creative solutions that may be less achievable individually. Working in a group can also include bouncing ideas off one another so members can identify any potential issues and provide helpful feedback and direction. Furthermore, group members are often more motivated and energized to work together, making the task more enjoyable than working alone. Lastly, shared accountability ensures that tasks are completed in a timely and effective manner, leading to better results than what could be achieved alone.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, y'all! Today we're talking about something that's really important to me: graduating high school early. Now, I know some people might think it's weird to want to finish high school in three years instead of the usual four, but hear me out. There are actually a ton of benefits to graduating early, and I'm gonna tell you all about 'em.

First of all, let's talk about the obvious one: time. When you finish high school early, you get to start college earlier too! And trust me, college is way more fun than high school. You get to take cool classes, make new friends, and explore all sorts of new interests. Plus, you'll be way more prepared for the real world when you graduate. I mean, who doesn't want to be done with school and start their career already?

But it's not just about the time thing. Graduating early can also save you money! Think about it: when you finish high school in three years instead of four, you're not paying for an extra year of school. That's a whole year of tuition, books, and other expenses that you don't have to worry about. And let's be real, college is super expensive. So, why not save that money and start your life earlier?

Another thing I think is really cool about graduating early is that it shows you're motivated and disciplined. When you're willing to put in the extra effort to finish high school early, it shows that you're someone who can handle challenges and reach their goals. And let's be real, college is not easy. It's gonna be hard, but if you're motivated and disciplined, you'll be way more likely to succeed.

Now, I know some people might be worried that graduating early will mean missing out on some important high school experiences. But honestly, I think you can still have fun and make memories without being in school for four years. You can still join clubs, play sports, and hang out with friends. It's all about finding a balance and making the most of your time.

"Working alone or in a group has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people believe that working in a group is more beneficial, others argue that working alone is more effective. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of working alone rather than in a group.

One of the main benefits of working alone is that it allows for more focused concentration. When working alone, you have complete control over your work environment and can work at your own pace without being disturbed by others. This can lead to a more efficient and effective work process, as you can focus on the task at hand without any distractions.

Another benefit of working alone is that it allows for more personalized learning. When working in a group, you may feel like you are being forced to conform to the pace and learning style of others. However, when working alone, you can tailor your learning to your own needs and pace. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the material and a more personalized approach to learning.

Working alone can also lead to greater creativity and innovation. When working in a group, you may feel like your ideas are being stifled by the opinions of others. However, when working alone, you have the freedom to explore your own ideas and be creative without fear of judgment. This can lead to more innovative and original solutions to problems.

Finally, working alone can lead to greater success. When working in a group, you may feel like you are being held back by the performance of others. However, when working alone, you have complete control over your own success. This can lead to greater motivation and a greater sense of accomplishment when you achieve your goals.

In conclusion, working alone has many benefits that cannot be overlooked. It allows for more focused concentration, personalized learning, greater creativity and innovation, and greater success. While working in a group has its own benefits, working alone can be just as effective and even more beneficial in certain situations. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important to have a balance between working alone and in a group, depending on the task at hand.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey there!  So, I guess you're here to read my essay on why setting your aims low can actually help you achieve your dreams and build character.  I mean, it's not every day you get to write about something like this, right? 

Okay, so let's get started! 

So, you know how people always say that setting your sights high is the way to go? Like, if you don't aim for the stars, you'll never reach the sky or something?  Well, I'm here to tell you that that's not always the case. 

See, when you set your aims low, you're actually giving yourself a chance to build your character.  Like, think about it. When you set your sights on something that's really hard, but still achievable, you're more likely to put in the effort and persevere. And that's where character comes in! 

Like, let's say you want to be a professional basketball player.  It's gonna take a lot of hard work and dedication to make it to the NBA, right?  But if you set your sights on being a recreational league player instead, you can still work on your skills and have fun without feeling like you're not good enough. 

And that's not all! Setting your aims low can also help you build resilience.  Like, when you face obstacles and setbacks, you're more likely to get discouraged and give up if you're aiming for something really high.  But if you're aiming for something more realistic, you can learn to bounce back from those setbacks and keep going. 

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But wait, if I set my aims low, I'll never reach my full potential!""  And to that, I say, ""Potential is overrated!""",1,llama2_chat,2
"Inactivity may not seem like it has much of a purpose, but engaging in activities and striving for a goal can have many benefits. It can provide us with a sense of purpose and accomplishment, and allow us to gain new skills and knowledge. For example, if you are learning a new language, the more actively engaged you are, the better your recall and understanding of the language will be. Working toward a goal gives us focus, motivation, and a strong sense of achievement.

"Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is no surprise that they are also present in classrooms. While some argue that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms, others believe that they should be banned. In this essay, I will evaluate the pros and cons of allowing cell phones to be used in classrooms.

On the one hand, there are several advantages to allowing cell phones in classrooms. Firstly, cell phones can be used as a tool for learning. With the availability of educational apps and online resources, students can use their cell phones to access information and complete assignments. This can be particularly useful for students who do not have access to a computer at home.

Secondly, cell phones can be used to facilitate communication between students and teachers. For example, students can use their cell phones to ask questions or seek clarification on a topic. Teachers can also use cell phones to communicate with students outside of class, such as through group chats or messaging apps.

However, there are also several disadvantages to allowing cell phones in classrooms. Firstly, cell phones can be a distraction to students. With the ability to access social media, play games, and watch videos, students may be tempted to use their cell phones instead of focusing on class. This can lead to a decrease in academic performance and a lack of engagement in class.

Secondly, cell phones can be a source of cheating. With the ability to access information online, students may be tempted to cheat on exams or assignments. This not only undermines the academic integrity of the classroom, but it also does a disservice to the students who are working hard and following the rules.

In conclusion, while there are several advantages to allowing cell phones in classrooms, there are also several disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision to allow cell phones in classrooms should be based on a careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. While cell phones can be a useful tool for learning and communication, they can also be a distraction and a source of cheating. It is important for schools and educators to find a balance that allows for the responsible use of cell phones in the classroom while maintaining academic integrity and student engagement.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Online classes vs. Traditional Classroom Learning: Which is Better?

As an 8th grader, I have had both experiences of taking classes in a traditional classroom setting and online. While both methods have their pros and cons, I believe that online classes are the better option for several reasons.

Firstly, one of the biggest advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. With online classes, you can complete your work at your own pace, which means you can take as much time as you need to finish your assignments. This is especially helpful for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities, as they can fit their schoolwork around these obligations. In contrast, traditional classroom learning requires you to be in class at a specific time, which can be limiting for students with busy schedules.

Another benefit of online classes is the ability to learn from the comfort of your own home. Imagine being able to sleep in and still attend class, or being able to take a break whenever you want without disturbing the other students. This flexibility can help students who have trouble concentrating in a traditional classroom setting, as they can learn in a more comfortable and familiar environment.

College-level courses are also increasingly being offered online, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. According to a report by the National Center for Education Statistics, the number of students taking online courses has been steadily increasing over the past decade, with over 30% of students taking at least one online course in 2020. This is because online courses offer a more convenient and flexible learning experience, allowing students to balance their schoolwork with other responsibilities.

In conclusion, while both traditional classroom learning and online classes have their advantages, I believe that online classes are the better option for several reasons. They offer flexibility, convenience, and the ability to learn from the comfort of your own home. As technology continues to advance, I expect to see more and more college-level courses being offered online, making it easier for students to access high-quality education from anywhere in the world.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Hey there!  So, I've been tasked with writing an essay about this guy who failed 408 times before finally succeeding in his experiment. Like, can you even imagine? Failing that many times? It's crazy! But, I guess that's just how it goes sometimes. 

So, the guy's name is Thomas Edison, and he's like, super famous for inventing the light bulb and stuff. But, did you know that he failed like, a bunch of times before he finally got it right? Like, 408 times, to be exact!  I mean, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to handle that much failure. I'd have given up like, after the first 10 tries or something. 

But, Edison was different. He was so enthusiastic about his work that he just kept going, even when things weren't working out. He didn't let failure get him down, you know? He was like, ""Okay, cool, that didn't work. Let me try again!"" And he just kept at it until he finally succeeded. 

It's really inspiring, you know? Like, if Edison can fail that many times and still keep going, then I can definitely handle a few setbacks in my own life. It just means I need to keep trying and not give up, no matter what. 

And it's not just Edison's enthusiasm that's inspiring. It's also his persistence. I mean, he didn't just give up after failing 407 times. He kept going, even when it seemed like it was never going to work out. That takes a lot of determination and hard work, you know? 

So, yeah, Edison's story is definitely an inspiring example of how success can be achieved through failure and enthusiasm. I mean, who would have thought that failing 408 times could lead to something so amazing?  It just goes to show that you should never give up on your dreams, no matter how hard things get",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey, so for this essay, I was like, totally stoked to write about how making decisions based on multiple opinions, especially from older people, is super important. Like, I know some people might think that just 'cause someone's older, they don't know what they're talking about, but that's not true at all.

First of all, older people have lived through so much more than we have. They've seen like, way more stuff than we have, and they've experienced way more stuff too. So, when they give their opinion on something, they're not just spouting off random stuff. They're actually giving us advice based on their own experiences, which is way more valuable than anything we could ever learn in school.

And, like, it's not just about what they've experienced personally. Older people have also seen how different situations have played out in the past. They know what works and what doesn't, and they can give us advice on how to avoid making the same mistakes that other people have made. It's like, they have this whole wealth of knowledge and experience that they can share with us, and it's totally worth listening to.

Another thing is, when we only listen to one person's opinion, we're missing out on so much. Like, if we only listen to our friends, we're only getting one side of the story. But if we listen to older people too, we get to see things from multiple perspectives. It's like, we're not stuck in this little bubble of our own thoughts and experiences. We're expanding our horizons and learning about the world in a way that's way more interesting and fun.

And, like, it's not just about learning new things. When we make decisions based on multiple opinions, we're also learning how to be better decision-makers. We're learning how to evaluate different perspectives, how to weigh the pros and cons, and how to make choices that are good for everyone. It's like, we're not just making decisions for ourselves, we're making decisions that affect the people around us too.

"Committing to a career at a young age can offer many potential benefits – not just to those considering a career path, but also to the wider society. Those who commit to a career early benefit from the opportunity to specialize in a much shorter time frame, allowing them to become experts in their field and develop skills relevant to their chosen field. This experience can also open up doors to further educational opportunities such as postsecondary study. By committing to a career early, individuals demonstrate a level of maturity and a dedication to the profession which can have a positive influence on their job prospects. Furthermore, committing to a career at a young age increases the likelihood of finding meaningful employment quicker and with greater job satisfaction.

"Having a positive attitude is crucial for leading a successful and happy life. It is the way we approach challenges and opportunities that we encounter in our daily lives. A positive attitude allows us to see the good in every situation, even when things may seem bleak. It also helps us to overcome obstacles and find solutions to problems.

One of the main benefits of having a positive attitude is that it helps us to stay motivated. When we are optimistic about the future, we are more likely to work hard and persevere through difficulties. This can lead to better academic performance, as well as success in our personal and professional lives. Additionally, a positive attitude can help us to build stronger relationships with others, as it makes us more approachable and easier to talk to.

Another benefit of a positive attitude is that it can improve our overall health and well-being. Research has shown that people who have a positive outlook on life are less likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. They also tend to have better physical health, as they are more likely to engage in healthy habits such as exercise and healthy eating.

It is important to note that having a positive attitude is not something that comes naturally to everyone. It takes effort and practice to develop a positive mindset. This can involve focusing on the good things in our lives, practicing gratitude, and reframing negative thoughts. It can also involve seeking out positive influences, such as friends and family members who have a positive attitude, or engaging in activities that bring us joy and fulfillment.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential for leading a successful and happy life. It helps us to stay motivated, build stronger relationships, and improve our overall health and well-being. While it may take some effort to develop a positive mindset, the benefits are well worth it. By cultivating a positive attitude, we can create a more fulfilling and meaningful life for ourselves and those around us.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Sure, here's my essay response:

Hey, so like, I know some people think it's a good idea for students to be able to bring their phones to school. But honestly, I don't think it's a super good idea. I mean, there are definitely some pros to it, like being able to look up stuff for class or check the time during breaks. But there are also some pretty big cons.

One of the main pros is that it can be really helpful for learning. Like, if you're in a history class and you're trying to remember some dates or events, you can just pull out your phone and look them up real quick. Or if you're in math and you need to check a formula, you can do that too. It's like, really convenient.

But there are also some cons. Like, if you're in class and you're on your phone all the time, you're not really paying attention to what the teacher is saying. And if you're texting or whatever during class, you could get in trouble. Or like, if you're in a group project and you need to work together, it's hard to do that if everyone's on their phone.

Another con is that it can be really distracting. Like, if you're in class and you see something funny on your phone, you might get distracted and not pay attention to the lesson. Or if you're texting with your friends during class, you might miss something important. It's like, really easy to get distracted.

So, overall, I don't think it's a good idea for students to be able to bring their phones to school. It's just too easy to get distracted and not pay attention to what's going on in class. And even though it might be helpful sometimes, it's not worth the distractions. I mean, we're in school to learn, not to be on our phones all the time.

"Having positive people around us is essential to maintain healthy self-esteem. By this, I mean people who validate our emotions and give us encouraging words. These people support us, no matter the situation, believing in the potential we have, and understanding us, which in turn helps us build more self-confidence. They help us see that our efforts are being noticed, thus boosting our self-esteem.

On the other hand, it is important to know how to handle negative people who want to change us. It can be quite difficult to resist the temptation to please them, because we want to feel accepted, even when this might mean doing something against our values. However, we need to be aware that these people may have the wrong intentions, and that if we oblige to their demands, we might lose our self-esteem in the long run.

I have experienced both scenarios. I had a teacher who believed in my abilities, and she kept pushing me to do more, until I achieved what I had set out to do. This built my self-esteem, showing me that I was capable of much more than I thought.Similarly, I had a friend who constantly put me down, never recognizing the things I did right. I ended up so focused on pleasing her, that I neglected my own priorities. I had to realize that I had to make my own decisions and that I was the one responsible for myself.

To sum up, the importance of positive people is immense, as they help build our self-esteem. We have to be aware of the toxic impact negative people have in our lives, and resist the temptation to please them. It is through these experiences that we learn to make decisions that best suit us, putting our own well-being first.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"One of the most important factors in achieving success in life is having a positive attitude. Research shows that having a positive attitude can lead to tangible benefits, such as making a good impression on those around you and inspiring those around you to also be positive. Additionally, having a positive attitude can often lead to gaining favor from others, making it easier to achieve goals.

However, there can be negative outcomes from having a positive attitude as well. For example, it is possible that one can be taken advantage of if they are always eager to help due to their positive attitude. Furthermore, jealousy can stem from one’s positivity if others have a negative attitude and cannot accept success achieved by someone else.

While hard work is also essential to achieving success, it is important to note that having the right mindset also plays a major role. It has been found that those with a strong work ethic combined with a positive attitude have a much better chance of succeeding in life.

"As an eighth-grade student, the decision to commit to a career is a significant one. While some people believe that committing to a career at a young age is advantageous, others argue that it can be detrimental. In this essay, I will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of committing to a career at a young age, evaluate the influence of parents and society on this decision, and discuss the opportunities and struggles that are associated with this commitment. Additionally, I will examine why the Board of Teachers from a private school think it is advantageous to commit to a career while young and illustrate examples of successful students who have committed to a career at a young age to back up my points.

On the one hand, committing to a career at a young age has several advantages. Firstly, it allows individuals to focus on their career goals and work towards achieving them. This focus can lead to a clearer understanding of what is required to succeed in their chosen field, which can ultimately lead to a more successful career. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can help individuals develop a sense of purpose and direction in life. This sense of purpose can motivate individuals to work harder and achieve their goals.

On the other hand, committing to a career at a young age can also have several disadvantages. Firstly, it can limit individuals' options and opportunities. If individuals commit to a career at a young age, they may not have the opportunity to explore other interests or career paths. This can lead to a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in their chosen career. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can put pressure on individuals to achieve their goals quickly, which can lead to burnout or stress.

The influence of parents and society on the decision to commit to a career at a young age cannot be overstated. Parents often play a significant role in shaping their children's career choices, and society also influences this decision. For example, in some cultures, certain careers are seen as more prestigious or desirable than others, which can influence an individual's decision to pursue a particular career. Additionally, societal expectations and pressures can also play a role in this decision. For example, individuals may feel pressure to pursue a career that is financially stable or provides job security.

"Sure, I'll give it a shot! Here's my essay:

Hey, so I'm pretty good at drawing. Like, really good. I've been drawing since I was a kid, and it's something that I've just naturally gotten better at over the years. I mean, I'm not the best artist in the world or anything, but I'm definitely pretty skilled for an 8th grader.

I remember when I first started drawing, my mom would sit with me and help me hold the pencil and stuff. She'd show me how to make different shapes and lines, and how to blend the colors together. My dad would also give me little drawing projects to do, like drawing a picture of our family dog or something. It was really fun, and it made me want to keep practicing and getting better.

As I got older, I started to realize that drawing was something that I was actually pretty good at. My friends would always be like, ""Wow, your drawings are so cool!"" and stuff, and it made me feel happy and proud. So I just kept practicing and experimenting with different techniques and styles. I'd look at other artists' work and try to figure out how they did things, and I'd try to incorporate those techniques into my own drawings.

But I don't just draw for fun. I also use it to express myself and my feelings. Like, if I'm feeling sad or upset about something, I'll just sit down and start drawing, and it helps me work through my emotions. It's like a way for me to talk without actually having to say anything. And sometimes, my drawings will end up looking really cool and interesting, and that's just an added bonus.

Of course, I've had some influences over the years. Like, my art teacher in 5th grade was really cool and taught me a lot of new techniques and stuff. And my friends are always giving me ideas for new drawings and stuff, so I'll be like, ""Oh, that's a good idea!"" and then I'll go and draw it. But I don't know, I guess I just kind of have a natural talent for it or something.

"Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is no different for individuals who are learning English as a second language (ESL). In fact, failure can be a valuable learning experience that can ultimately lead to success. In his famous speech, Sir Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement highlights the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of failure, which are essential qualities for ESL students to possess.

Research has shown that failure can have a significant impact on the success of ESL students. A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that ESL students who experienced more failures in their language learning were more likely to give up on their studies and ultimately fail to achieve their language goals. However, the study also found that students who were able to learn from their failures and use them as opportunities for growth were more likely to succeed in their language learning.

The role of failure in the pursuit of success is particularly important for ESL students because language learning is a complex process that requires a great deal of practice and repetition. Failure is a natural part of this process, and it is important for ESL students to learn how to handle it in a constructive way. This means being open to feedback, seeking out opportunities for improvement, and using mistakes as a way to learn and grow.

Churchill's statement on the role of failure in the pursuit of success is particularly relevant for ESL students because it emphasizes the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of challenges. ESL students who are able to bounce back from failures and continue to pursue their language goals are more likely to achieve success in the long run. This requires a mindset shift from seeing failure as a setback to seeing it as an opportunity for growth and learning.

In conclusion, failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is no different for individuals who are learning English as a second language. However, the impact of failure on the success of ESL students can be significant. ESL students who are able to learn from their failures and use them as opportunities for growth are more likely to succeed in their language learning.

"Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  Here's my essay on the benefits of attending a four-year high school instead of a three-year one. 

So, I think it's pretty obvious that attending a four-year high school has a lot of advantages. First of all, you get more time to explore your interests and passions. With an extra year, you can take more classes, join more clubs, and participate in more extracurriculars. And let's be real, who doesn't want to be the captain of the debate team or the president of the science club? 

Another benefit is that you get more time to develop your skills and knowledge in a particular area. Like, if you're really into math, you can take more advanced classes and get more prepared for college or a career in that field. Or, if you're into art, you can take more classes and get more experience with different mediums and techniques. 

Also, attending a four-year high school can give you a better chance of getting into college. Like, if you apply to a four-year college, you'll have more opportunities to take challenging classes and show off your skills. Plus, you'll have more time to prepare for standardized tests and applications. 

And let's not forget about the social benefits! With an extra year, you get more time to make new friends and connect with your classmates. You can form deeper bonds and build stronger relationships, which can be really important for your mental health and well-being. 

Now, I know some people might say that attending a four-year high school is too long, or that it's too expensive. But, in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Like, sure, it might be an extra year, but it's an extra year to learn and grow and develop as a person. And, honestly, the cost is worth it in the long run.

So, I know we're supposed to write an essay on the benefits of participating in extracurricular activities, but let's be real, it's not exactly the most exciting thing to talk about. 😴 Like, I get it, it's important and all, but it's not exactly the most thrilling topic. 😅

But, I guess I'll give it a shot. 🤷‍♀️ So, research shows that participating in extracurricular activities can have a bunch of benefits. Like, did you know that it can help you make new friends and develop social skills? 🤝 Yeah, I know, who doesn't love making new friends? 😜 And it's not just about making friends, it can also help you develop leadership skills, time management skills, and even help you find your passion or talent. 🎨 Like, I never knew I was into painting until I joined the art club in school. 🎭

But, let's be real, the best part about extracurricular activities is that they can help you avoid trouble. 🚨 Like, if you're not doing anything productive after school, you're probably getting into trouble. 😅 So, by participating in extracurricular activities, you can stay busy and avoid getting into mischief. 😜 Plus, it looks good on college applications and stuff, so it's like a win-win. 🎉

Now, I know some people might say that extracurricular activities are a waste of time, but I think they're wrong. 🙅‍♀️ Like, think about it, if you're not doing anything productive after school, you're probably just sitting around twiddling your thumbs. 🤦‍♀️ And that's not good for your mental health. 🤝 By participating in extracurricular activities, you can stay active and engaged, and who knows, you might even find something you're passionate about. 💖

Career Commitment: Can Teenagers Really Commit?

As an 8th grader, I've often wondered about the idea of committing to a career. It seems like a big responsibility, especially when you're still figuring out who you are and what you want to be when you grow up. But, according to some people, teenagers can't really commit to a career. They say that we're too young and immature to make such a big decision. But, is that really true?

Well, when I think about it, elementary school kids are always talking about what they want to be when they grow up. They're like, ""I want to be a doctor!"" or ""I want to be a firefighter!"" But, as you get older, that starts to change. Middle schoolers are more like, ""Uh, I don't know... maybe a YouTuber?"" or ""I'm not sure, but I don't want to be a doctor anymore."" It's like, they're not really sure what they want to do yet.

But, I think that's totally normal. I mean, I'm only 14, and I'm still figuring out who I am and what I want to be. And, let's be real, adults don't really know what they want to be either! Like, my mom is a teacher, but she didn't always want to be a teacher. She used to want to be a veterinarian, but then she realized she didn't like animals that much. So, it's not like adults have it all figured out either.

So, why do people think teenagers can't commit to a career? I think it's because they think we're too young and immature to make such a big decision. But, I think that's not fair. Just because we're young doesn't mean we can't make informed decisions. And, we're not all the same. Some of us are really mature and responsible, and we can totally commit to a career.

Of course, there are challenges to committing",1,llama2_chat,4
"As an 8th grader, I have to say that going outdoors is super important for our health and well-being. I mean, think about it – when we're inside all the time, we're missing out on so much! There are tons of fun activities to do outside, like playing sports, going for a walk or run, or even just hanging out in a park or backyard. And let's not forget about all the fresh air and sunshine we get when we're outside!

One of my favorite things to do outside is play sports. Whether it's soccer, basketball, or even just a game of catch with my friends, being outside and getting some exercise is so much fun. And it's not just fun – it's good for us too! Exercise can help us stay healthy and strong, and it can even boost our mood and energy levels. Plus, when we're outside, we get to enjoy the great outdoors and all its beauty.

But there are plenty of other things to do outside too. Like, have you ever tried geocaching? It's this cool game where you use a GPS to find hidden containers called ""caches."" It's like a treasure hunt outside, and it's so much fun! And if you like reading, you can always find a nice spot outside to sit and read a book. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you can try your hand at gardening or even just exploring nature.

But the thing is, not everyone goes outside as much as they should. Some people might be too busy with school or work, or they might just not feel like it. But trust me, going outside can have some serious benefits for your health! When we're inside all the time, we can start to feel cooped up and restless. Being outside can help us relax and reduce stress, and it can even help us sleep better at night. Plus, it's just plain fun!

Now, I know some people might be worried about going outside because of things like sunburn or bugs. But there are ways to protect yourself! You can wear sunscreen and bug spray, and you can always find a shady spot to hang out in. And besides, the benefits of going outside far outwe",1,llama2_chat,4
"Title: The Benefits of After School Programs: A Comprehensive Review

Introduction:
As an 8th grader, I know how important it is to have a well-rounded educational experience outside of the regular school day. After school programs offer a variety of activities and opportunities that can enhance my academic performance, social skills, and personal growth. In this essay, I will research and compare different after school programs available near my area, examine their advantages and disadvantages, and provide success stories of students who have benefited from these programs.

Research:
I conducted research on various after school programs available in my area, including sports, music, art, and tutoring programs. Here are some of the programs I found:

1. Sports programs: These programs offer a variety of sports and physical activities, such as basketball, soccer, and dance. They are usually led by experienced coaches and provide an opportunity for students to develop teamwork, discipline, and physical fitness skills.
2. Music programs: These programs offer music lessons and classes, such as piano, guitar, and choir. They provide an opportunity for students to develop their musical skills and creativity, and can also help improve their cognitive abilities.
3. Art programs: These programs offer various art classes, such as painting, drawing, and sculpture. They provide an opportunity for students to express their creativity and develop their fine motor skills.
4. Tutoring programs: These programs offer one-on-one or small group tutoring sessions in various subjects, such as math, science, and English. They provide an opportunity for students to receive additional academic support and improve their grades.

Comparison:
When comparing these programs, I looked at factors such as cost, content, and duration. Here are some of my findings:

* Cost: Some programs are free or low-cost, while others can be expensive. For example, sports programs may require a uniform and equipment, while music programs may require a musical instrument.
* Content: Each program offers unique content and activities. For example, sports programs focus on physical fitness and teamwork, while music programs focus on musical skills and creativity.
* Duration: Some programs are short-term, while others are long-term. For example, sports programs may last for a",1,llama2_chat,0
"Character traits are an essential part of human beings. They are the qualities that define us and make us who we are. Character traits are influenced by various factors, including external factors such as parents, friends, and media. In this essay, I will explore the influences of character traits in human beings, analyze firsthand experiences and research studies to explain how these traits are influenced by external factors, and discuss effective methods for cultivating character.

Parents play a significant role in shaping the character traits of their children. They are the first role models that children encounter, and their behavior and actions have a significant impact on the development of their children's character. Parents who exhibit positive traits such as kindness, honesty, and responsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits. On the other hand, parents who exhibit negative traits such as selfishness, dishonesty, and irresponsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits.

Friends also play a crucial role in shaping the character traits of individuals. Friends are a significant source of socialization and influence, and their behavior and actions can have a significant impact on the development of an individual's character. Friends who exhibit positive traits such as loyalty, empathy, and respect are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits. On the other hand, friends who exhibit negative traits such as bullying, dishonesty, and selfishness are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits.

Media also plays a role in shaping the character traits of individuals. The media, including television, movies, and social media, can have a significant impact on the development of an individual's character. Media that promotes positive traits such as kindness, honesty, and responsibility is more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits. On the other hand, media that promotes negative traits such as violence, greed, and selfishness is more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits.

While external factors such as parents, friends, and media can influence the development of character traits, they can also hinder it. For example, parents who exhibit negative traits such as abuse, neglect, and criticism can hinder the development of positive character traits in their children. Friends who exhibit negative traits such as bullying, dishonesty, and selfishness can also hinder the development of positive character traits in individuals. Media that promotes negative traits such as violence, greed, and selfish",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As I reflect on my friendships, I'm grateful to have so many people in my life that have shared their Wisdom and Experience with me. It is truly a luxury that many people do not have. Wisdom and Experience can be invaluable resources for making the right choices, particularly when it comes to making difficult decisions. Access to this information helps us better understand activities quickly, as well as consider multiple points of view that we may otherwise ignore. From the insight gleaned from others, we can gain an increased appreciation of certain activities by understanding the reasoning behind them and how we can best apply them.

Wisdom and Experience can also help us become stronger. Knowing the challenges that others have faced, and how they overcame them, provides us with strength and motivation to pursue our goals. We are better able to trust our instinct and bypass any doubt that would otherwise prevent us from reaching our highest potential. Furthermore, by understanding the choices that led to past successes, we can increase our level of confidence in the decisions that we make.

In conclusion, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of Wisdom and Experience in helping us make the right choices, understand activities more quickly, and become stronger. It serves as a reminder that no matter our current situation, there is much to be learned from the people around us and how their experiences can benefit our own. This knowledge should be duly valued, and I am fortunate to have such strong support of friends who are willing to share with me.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"The idea of a four-day school week has been met with both praise and scrutiny. Proponents argue that it would offer a much needed reprieve for students, families, and teachers alike. Research suggests that students could benefit from reduced stress brought about by eliminating the school week entirely on Fridays. In addition, parental involvement could increase, as families could use Friday as a day for enrichment activities with their children. 

On the other hand, disadvantages to a four-day school week could include longer school days for students and a more complex schedule for teachers. In addition, student-family relationships could be strained due to longer hours away from home and an increased academic workload. Furthermore, students may find it difficult to maintain their focus for a longer school day or to stay motivated over a longer school week.

The potential effects of a four-day school week should be considered carefully before deciding whether to move forward with such a change. The potential advantages and disadvantages should be thoroughly evaluated to create an equitable outcome that addresses the needs of students, families and teachers alike.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Praise is a powerful tool that can have a significant impact on a student's self-esteem, learning standards, and likelihood of graduating high school. While it is important to provide constructive feedback and criticism to help students improve their work, excessive praise can be counterproductive and even harmful.

When students receive praise for their deficient work, they may become complacent and overconfident in their abilities. This can lead to a decrease in their motivation to learn and improve, as they may believe that they are already doing well enough. Additionally, excessive praise can create unrealistic expectations and lead to a false sense of accomplishment, which can ultimately hinder their growth and development.

On the other hand, when students receive constructive feedback and criticism, they are more likely to improve their work and develop a growth mindset. This can lead to higher learning standards and a greater likelihood of success in school and beyond.

Furthermore, when students receive constructive feedback and criticism, they are more likely to graduate high school. Studies have shown that students who receive regular feedback and criticism are more likely to perform better academically and are more likely to graduate from high school.

In conclusion, while praise can be a useful tool to motivate and encourage students, excessive praise can be counterproductive and harmful. Instead, it is important to provide constructive feedback and criticism to help students improve their work, develop a growth mindset, and increase their likelihood of graduating high school.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, so bear with me! 😅

Okay, so here's my take on the whole cell phone thing in school. I think it's pretty obvious that using cell phones in class can be a big distraction. Like, who hasn't seen someone scrolling through their phone during a boring lecture or texting their BFF during a test? It's easy to get sucked into social media or games, and before you know it, the class is over and you've learned nothing! 🙃

But, I also think that cell phones can be kinda useful in school. I mean, we can use them to look up stuff for projects or to communicate with our group members. And, let's be real, sometimes you just need a quick Google search to figure out what the heck your teacher is talking about! 🤯

So, I think it's a bit of a catch-22. On one hand, cell phones can be distracting, but on the other hand, they can also be helpful. I don't think it's fair to completely ban them in school, but maybe there could be some rules about when and where we can use them. Like, maybe we can't use them during lectures or tests, but we can use them during breaks or for group projects. 🤔

One thing I've heard is that some schools are doing is called ""phone breaks."" So, like, during class time, we can put our phones away and focus on learning. And then, during breaks, we can use our phones to look up stuff or whatever. I think that's a pretty good compromise. 📱

Overall, I think cell phones can be both good and bad for academic performance. It's all about finding that balance and using them in a way that's helpful, not distracting. And, hey, maybe one day we'll figure out how to use them to teleport to class or something! 😅

That's my two cents, folks! 😉",1,llama2_chat,1
"One of the greatest gifts life has given me is the wisdom of my family. My parents and my sister have been giving me advice since I was a young child, and the lessons they shared with me have served me well throughout my life.

My mom has always told me to never give up, no matter what situation I face. She taught me that hard work and perseverance will always pay off, and to never be discouraged by failure. I've seen the power of this advice in my own life time and again; whenever I've faced a challenge I've never hesitated to keep going.

My dad's wisdom lies in showing me the value of gratitude. He taught me to always be grateful, even when life doesn't seem to be going my way. I try to remind myself of this during the toughest of times, and it always brings me back to a place of appreciation.

My sister has perhaps the most meaningful advice of all: to always be true to myself. Growing up surrounded by expectations, it was often hard to decipher what exactly was true to me. But my sister's words of wisdom are something I cling to, and I remind myself of them whenever I find myself struggling with making the right decision.

The wisdom of my family has been with me since I was young, and shapes my outlook on life even today. I'm so grateful to have a support system I can turn to in times of need, and the advice I've been given will continue to be a driving force in my life for years to come.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the topic ""Small Acts of Kindness Can Have a Big Impact"" as an 8th grade student:

Small acts of kindness can have a huge impact on others. It's easy to think that small things like smiling at someone or holding the door for someone else don't matter, but they can actually make a big difference in someone's day.

For example, when I was walking to school this morning, I saw a girl who looked really upset. She was crying and looked like she was about to fall down. I went up to her and asked if she was okay. She told me that she had just lost her favorite toy and was really upset. I gave her a hug and told her that everything will be okay. She smiled and thanked me, and I could see the sadness in her eyes start to fade away.

That small act of kindness made her day a little bit brighter, and it only took a minute or two of my time. But it made me realize that even the smallest acts of kindness can have a big impact on someone else.

Another example is when my teacher, Mrs. Johnson, gave us a homework assignment that was really hard. Some of my classmates were complaining and saying that it was unfair. But instead of joining in, I told them to calm down and that we could figure it out together. We worked as a class and helped each other understand the assignment, and it turned out to be a lot easier than we thought.

That small act of kindness made my classmates feel supported and helped them to feel more confident in their abilities. It also made Mrs. Johnson happy because we were able to finish the assignment on time and turn it in.

Small acts of kindness can also have a ripple effect. When we do something nice for someone else, they are more likely to do something nice for someone else, and it can keep going on and on. For example, when I volunteered at the local animal shelter last weekend, I saw how happy the dogs were when they got treats and attention. It made me want to do more volunteer work and help more animals.

In conclusion, small acts of kindness can have a big impact on others.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Title: The Power of Perseverance: Overcoming Failure to Achieve Success

Introduction:
Hey there! Let's talk about something that I think is super important - success! I mean, who doesn't want to be successful, right? But the thing is, failure is a part of the journey to success. Every successful person has faced failure at some point, but what sets them apart is their ability to overcome it. In this essay, I'm going to research some successful people and identify the points at which they overcame failure and stayed enthusiastic to achieve success. I'll also outline the factors that enabled them to achieve success and draw a comparison to my own life.

First up, let's talk about J.K. Rowling. She's the author of the Harry Potter series, which has sold millions of copies worldwide. But did you know that she was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book?! That's a lot of rejection, right? But she didn't give up. She kept writing and eventually found success. I can relate to this because I've had my fair share of rejection too. Like the time I tried out for the school play and didn't get the role I wanted. It was super disappointing, but I didn't give up. I kept practicing and eventually landed a smaller role. It's easy to get discouraged when things don't go our way, but it's important to keep trying.

Next, let's talk about Steve Jobs. He's the co-founder of Apple and is known for inventing the iPhone. But did you know that he was fired from the company he founded?! Yeah, it's true. But instead of giving up, he used that experience to fuel his passion and create something even better. He didn't let failure hold him back. I can relate to this because I've had a similar experience. Like the time I got a bad grade on a test and felt like I was a total failure. But I didn't let it get me down. I studied harder and eventually got a better grade on the next test. It's important to learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward.

"Character traits are the unique qualities that define a person. They are formed through a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors. In this essay, we will explore how parents, siblings, friends, and school play a role in shaping these traits.

Parents have a significant influence on their children's character traits. They provide a nurturing environment and model behavior that can shape their children's personality. For example, parents who are warm and supportive are more likely to raise children who are empathetic and trusting. On the other hand, parents who are cold and critical may raise children who are anxious and insecure.

Siblings also play a role in shaping character traits. Sibling relationships can be positive or negative, and this can influence the development of traits such as cooperation, empathy, and conflict resolution. Siblings who have positive relationships tend to develop stronger social skills and a greater sense of empathy. However, siblings who have negative relationships may develop traits such as jealousy and aggression.

Friends also play a role in shaping character traits. Peer relationships can be positive or negative, and this can influence the development of traits such as self-esteem, social skills, and conflict resolution. Friends who are supportive and positive tend to raise self-esteem and develop stronger social skills. However, friends who are critical and negative may lower self-esteem and develop traits such as anxiety and depression.

Finally, school plays a role in shaping character traits. School provides a structured environment where children learn academic skills and social norms. Teachers and peers can influence the development of traits such as self-discipline, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Schools that promote positive values and provide a supportive environment tend to raise children with stronger character traits.

In conclusion, character traits are formed through a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors. Parents, siblings, friends, and school all play a role in shaping these traits. It is important for parents, siblings, friends, and schools to provide a supportive and positive environment to promote the development of strong character traits.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Honesty is an important part of every successful relationship. Always being honest with your friends and family can help create trust and create long-lasting relationships. On the other hand, being too honest and blunt without considering the consequences of your words can mean hurting those you care about the most. 

The pros of always being honest with friends and family include being able to stay genuine, creating an atmosphere of trust and respect among relationships, and understanding the true intentions of others. Being proactive and honest with one another helps build trust right away and it can lead to stronger bonds between those involved. Understanding the true intentions of others may prevent any kind of misunderstanding and facilitate honest conversations. 

On the other hand, being honest with loved ones comes with a risk factor. It’s possible to hurt each other’s feelings by being too honest or brutally honest at times. When honesty is taken too far, it can start to look like criticism and can damage relationships that were built on trust and respect. Additionally, honesty in relationships can also cause discomfort while talking about delicate matters. 

In conclusion, always being honest with friends and family can have both pros and cons. While it can lead to better understanding between relationships and create an atmosphere of trust and respect, it can also come with a risk factor of hurting relationships and feelings. Therefore, in relationships it is important to weigh the consequences of any decision before making them.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Making our own decisions in life is one of the most important and rewarding aspects of being an independent adult. It is our choices that help define our lives, shape our outlook on the world, and in some cases, even determine our destiny. However, making our own decisions can be a daunting task, fraught with challenges and difficulty. Decisions can be complex and require careful consideration, making them difficult to make quickly or on the fly. Additionally, the consequences of making the wrong decision can be catastrophic. 

In order to make better decisions, some people look to others for guidance and mentorship. Taking advice from people we trust can provide valuable insight and perspective and help to narrow down our choices. Other people just need more time; taking a step back and slowing down can allow the right decision to emerge. In addition, having an open and honest discussion with family and close friends can help support the decision-making process and provide clarity. 

No matter what approach is used, it is important to remember that the decision making process is highly personal and that the ultimate decision lies with the individual. Every person must approach decisions in their own way and have faith in their own judgment. By making our own decisions and trusting ourselves, we can create a life for ourselves that is meaningful and true.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Joining extracurricular activities can be an invaluable part of a child's educational journey, allowing students to explore their interests, make new friends, and grow emotionally and intellectually. However, allowing students to choose which activities they participate in also carries several risks. Without parental guidance, students run the risk of making choices that might not be in their best academic or social interests. Additionally, leaving the decision up to the students can lead to inconsistency in terms of the messages they are receiving from adults and peers. This could lead to the student feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about which activities are right for them. Ultimately, whether or not to leave the decision of joining extracurricular activities up to students depends on the age and maturity of the student, as well as the quality of the guidance from parents and teachers.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Although there are plentiful excuses for students not to attend school, including illness, family trips, or lack of interest, natural disasters and other issues in the student's neighborhood can also make it difficult for them to attend. The impact of absences and making up an entire year of schooling can be significantly detrimental to a student's academic success. To help students in difficult circumstances, one solution is to offer distance learning opportunities, which allows students to stay on track without having to attend in person. However, many argue that the effectiveness of distance learning is limited compared to the traditional in-person classroom setting, making it a controversial topic. Ultimately, there is no easy answer, and it should be approached differently depending on the specific situation.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that adding an extra hour and a half to the school day would have a significant impact on students, teachers, and bus drivers. While this may seem like a minor change, it would have a significant impact on their physical health, mental health, and happiness.

Firstly, students would benefit greatly from an extra hour and a half in the school day. This extra time would allow them to complete more work, study more, and take breaks throughout the day. This would reduce the stress and anxiety that many students experience due to the pressure to complete their work in a short amount of time. Additionally, students would have more time to socialize with their peers, which is essential for their mental and emotional well-being.

However, teachers would also be affected by this change. With an extra hour and a half in the school day, teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for their lessons. This would allow them to create more engaging and effective lessons, which would ultimately benefit their students. Additionally, teachers would have more time to collaborate with their colleagues, which is essential for their professional development.

Finally, bus drivers would also be impacted by this change. With an extra hour and a half in the school day, bus drivers would have more time to complete their routes and ensure the safety of their passengers. This would reduce the stress and anxiety that many bus drivers experience due to the pressure to complete their routes on time. Additionally, bus drivers would have more time to socialize with their colleagues, which is essential for their mental and emotional well-being.

In terms of after-school programs, this change could have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, an extra hour and a half in the school day would allow students to participate in after-school programs more easily. This would give students more opportunities to pursue their interests and hobbies, which is essential for their personal and professional development.

On the other hand, after-school programs may be affected by this change. With an extra hour and a half in the school day, after-school programs may have to start later or end earlier. This could reduce the number of students who participate in these programs, which would ultimately limit their opportunities for personal and professional development.

In conclusion, adding an extra hour and a half to the school day would have a significant impact on students, teachers, and bus",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey, y'all!  Today, we're gonna talk about this dope quote from Duke Ellington.  ""Being a musician is like being a painter. You paint with sound."" 🎨🎵 I mean, can you get more lit than that?! 🔥

First off, let's talk about why this quote is so fire.  It's like, think about it. When you're listening to music, you're not just hearing sounds, you're experiencing a whole freakin' vibe. It's like, the notes are painting a picture in your mind. Like, have you ever listened to ""Mood Indigo""?  It's like, the sadness seeps into your soul and makes you feel all the feels. 😔

But here's the thing, y'all. Music isn't just a way to express emotions, it's also a way to bring people together.  Think about it. When you're at a concert, you're not just listening to the music, you're sharing the experience with like-minded people. You're all feeling the same vibes, and it's like, this collective energy that's like, bonding you all together. 🎉

And let's not forget about the cultural impact, bruh.  Music is like, this universal language that can transcend boundaries. Like, you can be from different countries, speak different languages, but when you hear a sick beat, you're like, ""Yo, what's good fam?"" 🤜🤛 It's like, this way to connect with people on a deeper level.

Now, I know some of y'all might be thinking, ""But, like, music isn't for everyone.""  And that's cool, I guess. But here's the thing, music is like, subjective, you know? What one person loves, another person might not. But that's the beauty of it, y'all. There's something out there for everyone.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, schools totally need an after school homework club, you know?  Here are three reasons why:

First of all, it's, like, super important for students to have help with their homework. I mean, sometimes it can be really hard to understand stuff, and it's easy to get behind. But if there was an after school homework club, kids could get extra help from teachers or tutors. That way, they can catch up and feel less stressed out. Plus, it's a great way to get help on specific subjects, like math or reading, that might be tricky. 

Secondly, an after school homework club can be a really cool place to hang out with friends. Like, imagine being able to do your homework with your BFFs?  It would be way more fun than doing it alone at home. Plus, you could help each other out and learn from each other. It would be like a study group, but way more chill. 

Lastly, an after school homework club can help students develop good study habits. If kids are in a structured environment, like a club, they might be more likely to stay on task and finish their work. It's also a great way to teach them time management skills, like how to prioritize tasks and set goals.

"Pursuing activities that make us happy is essential in life. It is easy to get caught up in the daily routine of work, school, and other responsibilities, but it is important to take a step back and focus on what brings us joy. When we prioritize our happiness, we can lead more fulfilling lives and find a sense of purpose.

One of the benefits of pursuing activities that make us happy is that it allows us to recharge and refresh our minds. When we are engaged in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel relaxed and content. This can lead to increased productivity and better performance in other areas of our lives. For example, if we enjoy exercising, we are more likely to be in better physical and mental health, which can improve our overall well-being.

Additionally, pursuing activities that make us happy can help us to develop a sense of purpose. When we engage in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. This can lead to a greater sense of purpose and direction in life. For example, if we enjoy painting, we may feel a sense of fulfillment in creating something beautiful and expressing ourselves through our art.

It is also important to note that pursuing activities that make us happy can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and contentment in life. When we engage in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel happy and fulfilled. This can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and contentment in life, which can improve our overall well-being. For example, if we enjoy spending time with our friends and family, we are more likely to feel a sense of connection and belonging, which can improve our overall happiness and well-being.

In conclusion, pursuing activities that make us happy is essential in life. It allows us to recharge and refresh our minds, develop a sense of purpose, and lead a more fulfilling life. It is important to prioritize our happiness and make time for activities that bring us joy, no matter what they may be. By doing so, we can lead more fulfilling lives and find a greater sense of purpose and direction in life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Sure, I'd be happy to write an essay about one of my skills or talents!

One skill that I'm really passionate about is playing the guitar. I've been playing for about three years now, and it's become a big part of my life. I love how it allows me to express myself and relieve stress. Whenever I'm feeling down, I can pick up my guitar and start playing, and it always makes me feel better.

Developing my guitar skills has been a process. At first, it was really hard to press down on the strings and make the right chords. My fingers were sore and my hands would cramp up, but I didn't give up. I practiced every day, even if it was just for a few minutes. As time went on, I started to get better, and I could play more complex songs. Now, I can play my favorite songs and even write my own music.

Playing the guitar has also helped me in other areas of my life. For example, it's taught me patience and perseverance. When I first started playing, I was frustrated because I couldn't get it right away. But, I kept practicing and eventually, I started to see progress. This has helped me in other areas of my life, like schoolwork and sports. Whenever I'm struggling with something, I remind myself of how I learned to play the guitar, and it gives me the motivation to keep going.

Another way that playing the guitar has impacted my life is by providing an outlet for self-expression. Whenever I'm feeling emotional or want to express something, I can pick up my guitar and play. It's like my own personal therapy session. I can play songs that reflect how I'm feeling, and it helps me process my emotions. It's also a way for me to connect with others, whether it's through playing at school events or sharing my music with friends and family.

Overall, playing the guitar has become a big part of my life. It's taught me valuable skills like patience and perseverance, and it provides an outlet for self-expression. I'm grateful that I discovered this talent, and I can't wait to see where it takes",1,llama2_chat,2
"Working alone versus working with a group: which one is better? This is a question that has been debated for years, with each side presenting its own set of arguments. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits of working alone versus working with a group, and argue that working with a group is ultimately more beneficial.

Working alone has its advantages. For one, it allows for a great deal of focus and concentration. When working alone, there are no distractions or interruptions from other group members. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Additionally, working alone allows for a great deal of autonomy and control over one's work. This can be particularly beneficial for those who prefer to work at their own pace and in their own way.

However, working alone also has its disadvantages. For one, it can be isolating and lonely. Without the support and collaboration of a group, it can be difficult to stay motivated and engaged. Additionally, working alone can limit the amount of knowledge and expertise that can be gained. Without the perspectives and ideas of others, it can be difficult to come up with creative solutions to problems.

Working with a group, on the other hand, has its own set of benefits. For one, it allows for collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and expertise. When working with a group, each member brings their own unique skills and perspectives to the table. This can lead to a more well-rounded and comprehensive solution to a problem. Additionally, working with a group can provide a sense of community and support. This can be particularly beneficial for those who may be new to a particular field or topic.

However, working with a group also has its disadvantages. For one, it can be difficult to manage and coordinate the efforts of a group. This can lead to conflicts and delays in completing tasks. Additionally, working with a group can be distracting and overwhelming, with multiple people vying for attention and input.

In conclusion, working alone and working with a group each have their own set of benefits and disadvantages. While working alone can provide a great deal of focus and autonomy, it can also be isolating and limit the amount of knowledge and expertise that can be gained. Working with a group, on the other hand, allows for collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and expertise, but can also be difficult to manage and distract",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As an 8th grader, I have been growing up with the internet and the various online activities that it offers. From shopping to playing games and connecting with people on social media sites, the internet has become an integral part of our daily lives. While these activities have their benefits, they also come with risks. In this essay, I will argue that staying connected with the world is important, but there should be limits, and not everyone needs to know all the information about other people.

One of the primary benefits of engaging in online activities is the convenience they offer. With a few clicks, we can purchase items, play games, and communicate with friends and family from anywhere in the world. Additionally, these activities provide entertainment and a way to unwind after a long day. However, there are also risks associated with these activities. For example, shopping online can lead to overspending and impulse buying, while playing games can become addictive and take away from other important activities. Connecting with people on social media sites can also have negative effects on mental health, leading to feelings of isolation and anxiety.

It is essential to strike a balance between staying connected with the world and limiting our online activities. While it is important to stay informed and connected with others, it is also essential to prioritize our well-being and ensure that our online activities do not negatively impact our mental health or relationships. This can be achieved by setting limits on the amount of time spent on these activities and taking breaks to engage in other activities that promote mental and physical health.

Furthermore, it is not necessary for everyone to know all the information about other people. While it can be interesting to learn about the lives of others, it is not essential to know everything about them. It is important to respect other people's privacy and boundaries and not to infringe on their personal space. This can be achieved by being mindful of our words and actions and avoiding gossip or spreading rumors about others.

In conclusion, staying connected with the world is important, but there should be limits. Online activities such as shopping, playing games, and connecting with people on social media sites have their benefits and risks. It is essential to strike a balance between these activities and prioritize our well-being. Additionally, it is not necessary for everyone to know all the information about other people, and we should respect their privacy and boundaries. By doing so,",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Technology has revolutionized the way people communicate and access information. One of the most significant benefits of technology is the ability to connect with people from all over the world. With the rise of social media, video conferencing, and instant messaging, people can now communicate with friends, family, and colleagues from anywhere in the world.

One of the most important aspects of technology is its ability to connect people in an emergency. With the advent of 911, people can now call for help in a matter of seconds. 911 is a universal emergency number that is recognized in every country in the world, and it has saved countless lives. For example, in the United States, 911 has been in operation for over 50 years and has helped to save millions of lives.

In addition to its ability to connect people in an emergency, technology has also revolutionized the way people access information. With the rise of search engines, people can now find information on any topic in just a few clicks. This has made it easier for people to learn about new things and has opened up new opportunities for people. For example, a student who wants to learn more about a particular subject can simply search for it online and find a wealth of information on the topic.

In conclusion, technology has had a profound impact on people's lives. It has made it easier for people to communicate with each other, access information, and connect in an emergency. While there are certainly some negative aspects of technology, the positive effects cannot be denied. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more benefits in the future.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that changing the school menu is a topic that deserves careful consideration. While some changes may seem beneficial, others may not be so positive. In this essay, I will discuss both the pros and cons of changing the school menu.

On the one hand, changing the school menu could have several benefits. For example, it could help to improve the nutritional value of the meals served. Many students complain about the lack of healthy options on the menu, and changing it could address this issue. Additionally, introducing new and exciting dishes could help to increase student participation in the school meal program. This could lead to increased revenue for the school and potentially even a decrease in truancy rates.

On the other hand, changing the school menu could also have several drawbacks. Firstly, it could be costly. Introducing new dishes and ingredients could increase the cost of the meals served, which could be a burden on students and their families. Additionally, some students may not be willing to try new dishes, which could lead to a decrease in participation in the school meal program. This could result in a loss of revenue for the school and potentially even a decrease in the quality of the meals served.

In conclusion, changing the school menu is a topic that deserves careful consideration. While there may be some benefits to making changes, there are also potential drawbacks that must be taken into account. Ultimately, it is up to the school administration to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is in the best interests of the students and the school community.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1

"Attitude is perhaps one of the most important traits when it comes to success in life. People with a positive attitude approach situations with optimism and enthusiasm, which in turn leads to better outcomes. This is just as true in the workplace as it is in life. Having a good attitude can connect people to more opportunities and give them the confidence to excel.

Having a good attitude also helps with problem solving. People who have a positive outlook are more likely to stay focused on the solutions, rather than getting fixed on the problems. This mindset can help them come to better and more realistic solutions.

Moreover, having a good attitude can reduce stress and maximize happiness. People with a positive attitude can better handle the inevitable challenges that life will bring, creating a more fulfilling and rewarding life.

In conclusion, having a good attitude is essential for success in life and work. It helps with connecting with more opportunities and problem solving, while also reducing stress and maximizing happiness.

"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance versus making your own decisions. In today's world, it is easy to rely on technology and social media to make decisions, but it is important to consider the values and life matters that are most important to you.

The first step in making an informed decision is to understand the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance. Seeking guidance from experts can provide a fresh perspective on a situation, as well as access to knowledge and resources that may not be available to you. Additionally, seeking guidance can help you avoid making decisions that may have negative consequences, such as financial or legal issues.

The second step in making an informed decision is to list the values and life matters that are most important to you. For me, my values include honesty, integrity, and respect for others. These values are important to me because they guide my actions and help me make decisions that align with my personal beliefs. Additionally, my life matters most to me include my family, friends, and my education. These are important to me because they provide a sense of belonging and purpose in my life.

The third step in making an informed decision is to compare making your own decisions to seeking guidance from experts. While making your own decisions can be empowering and provide a sense of autonomy, it can also be risky and lead to negative consequences. On the other hand, seeking guidance from experts can provide a sense of security and help you avoid making decisions that may have negative consequences. However, it is important to note that seeking guidance should not replace making your own decisions, as it is important to develop your own skills and independence.

In conclusion, making your own decisions is important for you as it allows you to develop your own skills and independence. Additionally, understanding the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance can help you make informed decisions that align with your values and life matters. It is important to find a balance between making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts, as both have their own unique benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, the key to making informed decisions is to understand your own values and life matters, and to seek guidance when necessary.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Working with a group can be menacing and rewarding in equal measure. On one hand, it has the advantage of providing ideas, resources, and support, allowing individuals to learn and gain insight from one another. This synergistic relationship allows people to become their best, but can also lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed. Working alone has the advantage of freeing an individual from feeling the pressure of being a part of a collective, and allows them to steer their own course without feeling like they have to meet anyone else's expectations. 

At the same time, working alone can be isolating and lonely, with individuals surrounded only by their own thoughts and beliefs. If left unchecked, this can lead to the erosion of one's personality and social relationships, making it hard to interact with others when the situation calls for it. Working as a group can be beneficial in difficult situations because it allows people the opportunity to pull together in times of need, utilizing a collective knowledge base to get the job done efficiently and effectively. This also ties in with the importance of friendship and respect within a group, allowing individuals to understand and appreciate one another, creating a culture that is both cordial and productive. 

In conclusion, there are advantages and disadvantages to working with a group and working alone, but it is important to examine the implications of each carefully and decide which method is best suited for the task at hand. While it may be tempting to stay isolated, there are undoubtedly great rewards to be found in working as a part of a collective, and the strength and support it provides can be invaluable.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

It is important to research the cost of each program before committing to one, as it can impact a student's ability to participate.

The content of after school programs is also an important factor to consider. Some programs focus on academic enrichment, while others focus on physical activity or creative pursuits. It is important to choose a program that aligns with a student's interests and goals. The duration of after school programs can also vary, with some programs meeting only once a week, while others meet multiple times per week or even every day.

Success stories of students who have used after school programs can be a great way to understand the benefits of these programs.

"Thomas Jefferson was a founding father of the United States and a prominent figure in American history. He was known for his writings on various topics, including the importance of avoiding idleness. In his essay ""The Art of Letter Writing,"" Jefferson wrote, ""A mind idle and unoccupied is the breeding-ground of mischief."" This statement can be applied to modern life in several ways.

Firstly, idleness can lead to boredom and a lack of purpose. When we are not engaged in meaningful activities, we are more likely to become restless and seek out ways to fill our time. This can lead to impulsive decisions and actions that may not be beneficial in the long run. For example, I have seen friends and family members become restless and bored during the summer months when they are not in school or work. They may spend their time engaging in reckless behavior or making poor choices that can have long-term consequences.

Secondly, idleness can lead to a lack of productivity and efficiency. When we are not focused on a task or goal, we are more likely to waste time and resources. This can be seen in the workplace, where employees who are not fully engaged in their work may not be as productive as those who are actively working towards a goal. In my experience, I have seen colleagues who are not fully engaged in their work take longer to complete tasks and make more mistakes.

Finally, idleness can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. When we are not actively engaging in learning and self-improvement, we are less likely to develop new skills and knowledge. This can limit our potential and prevent us from achieving our full potential. In my own experience, I have seen friends and family members who are not fully engaged in their personal growth become stagnant and unfulfilled.

In addition to avoiding idleness, not responding to provocation can also be beneficial in modern life. Jefferson wrote, ""A mind that is not fully occupied in some pursuit will soon find itself occupied in idle fancies."" This statement highlights the importance of keeping our minds active and engaged. When we are not fully engaged in a task or goal, we may become distracted by idle thoughts or provocation from others. However, by not responding to provocation, we can maintain our focus and avoid getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts.

"Working with local companies and organizations to complete community projects can be a beneficial experience for students. It can provide students with the opportunity to gain valuable real-world experience, build their resume, and network with members of their local community. Such work typically involves tasks like conducting research, problem solving, implementing solutions, working with stakeholders, writing reports, and presenting about their findings. 

However, working with local partners can also come with potential risks. It is important that students ensure that they are aware of any safety risks and protocol that comes along with the project. There can also be a risk of miscommunication or discrepancies between the student and local partner. Furthermore, it is important to understand that working locally can involve long-term commitments which may affect the student’s ability to manage their personal and academic responsibilities. 

In addition, many students find working on local projects opens up the possibility to create long-term solutions to problems in their community. This not only benefits the student personally, but it can often lead to broader, positive effects.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about how asking multiple people for advice is way better than just asking one person. Like, duh, right? 🤷‍♀️

So, there are different kinds of advice people ask for. Some people ask for advice on what to wear, what to eat, or what movie to watch. But, like, sometimes we need advice on bigger things, like how to deal with a tough situation or how to make a decision. And that's where asking multiple people comes in! 💡

When you ask multiple people for advice, you get to hear different perspectives and viewpoints. It's like, you know, having a whole team of experts working together to help you solve a problem! 🤝 And, let's be real, sometimes one person's advice might not be the best, but when you ask more people, you get a better idea of what's up. Plus, it's cool to hear how different people think and how they might approach a situation differently. 🤔

Another cool thing about asking multiple people for advice is that you might learn something new! Like, you might hear a new idea or a new way of looking at things that you never thought of before. It's like, you're not limited to just one person's way of thinking, you know? 💡 And, it's not just about the advice itself, but also about the people you're asking. You might make new friends or connect with people who have similar interests! 🤗

Lastly, asking for advice shows that you're willing to learn and grow. It's like, you're not afraid to ask for help and you're open to new ideas and perspectives. And, let's be real, who doesn't love learning new things? 🤓 So, yeah, asking multiple people for advice is way better than just asking one person. It's like, you get more bang for your buck, you know? 💯

But, I guess some people might say that it's good for our health. And I get that. But, like, have you seen the size of the portions they give us? It's like they're trying to fatten us up or something! 🥲 I don't need to be eating a whole chicken breast every day. Can't they just give us something small and easy to eat?

"Online classes from home provide students with an abundance of benefits.  To be successful in taking one, students need to be focused and have high concentration levels. These classes offer students a chance to develop new skills and knowledge quickly and efficiently. An added perk of taking classes online is that students may also have the opportunity to have free time for other activities.

"Extracurricular activities are an essential part of a student's life. They provide an opportunity for students to explore their interests, develop new skills, and build relationships with their peers. However, the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to students and their families. In this essay, I will argue why this is the case.

Firstly, students already have too much pressure on their shoulders. They are expected to perform well academically, complete their assignments on time, and excel in extracurricular activities. This pressure can lead to stress and burnout, which can negatively impact their mental health and academic performance. If students are given the freedom to choose their extracurricular activities, they can choose activities that they are passionate about and that align with their interests and goals. This will reduce the pressure they feel and allow them to focus on their academic and personal development.

Secondly, students have limited time to complete school assignments and study. They have to attend classes, do homework, and prepare for exams. If they are also involved in extracurricular activities, they may struggle to balance their academic and personal commitments. By allowing students to choose their extracurricular activities, they can choose activities that fit their schedule and do not interfere with their academic performance. This will ensure that they have enough time to complete their assignments and study effectively.

Finally, students should be able to make their own decisions regarding extracurricular activities. They are individuals with their own unique interests, goals, and priorities. They know what activities will benefit them the most and what activities they are passionate about. If they are given the freedom to choose their extracurricular activities, they will be more engaged and invested in their personal and academic development. This will lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful high school experience.

In conclusion, the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to students and their families. Students already have too much pressure on their shoulders, and they have limited time to complete school assignments and study. By allowing students to choose their extracurricular activities, they can choose activities that align with their interests and goals, reduce the pressure they feel, and ensure that they have enough time to focus on their academic and personal development.

"Being part of a strong, productive team can offer a range of advantages and create an atmosphere of mutual support, making tasks much more enjoyable. Working in a group brings us the opportunity to brainstorm, collaborate, and learn from each other’s knowledge and expertise. It also encourages us to be proactive and enhances the productivity of the entire team. 

I can certainly vouch for this. During my years in college, I worked on many projects in small teams, and each time I'd take away some new insight or valuable knowledge. Working with others also provided an atmosphere of accountability where members could help each other stay on track and work out problems together.

Outside sources can also provide evidence for the benefits of working in groups. According to a study by Fordham University’s Center for Teaching Excellence, “When a student works in a group, they can often come up with insights, questions, and explanations that they might not have thought of on their own. In addition, peers can challenge and motivate each other which can lead to higher-quality work.” It is clear, then, that group work can be an incredibly effective and important learning experience for all parties involved.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always been interested in learning about the partnerships, local companies, and organizations associated with my school. I believe that understanding these entities can help me make informed decisions about my future and career goals. In this essay, I will research and analyze the partnerships, local companies, and organizations associated with my school, identify the activities associated with each of these entities, and determine what type of workplace environment would suit my interests and preferences.

Firstly, my school has partnerships with several local companies and organizations. One such partnership is with a local technology company, which provides our school with access to their facilities and resources. Through this partnership, our school is able to offer technology-based courses and workshops to our students. Additionally, the company provides mentorship opportunities for our students, which can be invaluable in helping them develop their skills and prepare for their future careers.

Another partnership our school has is with a local non-profit organization, which focuses on environmental conservation. Through this partnership, our school is able to offer courses and workshops related to sustainability and environmental science. The organization also provides opportunities for our students to participate in volunteer projects and internships, which can help them gain practical experience and develop their passion for environmental conservation.

In addition to partnerships, there are several local companies and organizations that are associated with my school. One such company is a local manufacturing firm, which provides our school with internships and job opportunities for our students. The company also offers mentorship programs and career fairs, which can help our students learn more about the manufacturing industry and explore potential career paths.

Another local organization that is associated with my school is a community center, which offers a variety of programs and activities for our students. The community center provides access to sports facilities, music and art studios, and academic support services. Additionally, the community center offers volunteer opportunities and leadership programs, which can help our students develop important skills and give back to their community.

When it comes to determining what type of workplace environment would suit my interests and preferences, I believe that a collaborative and supportive work environment is essential. I am drawn to companies and organizations that prioritize teamwork and communication, as these are skills that I believe are essential for success in any field. Additionally, I prefer workplaces that offer opportunities for professional development and growth, as these can help me continue to learn and grow",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Working towards a goal and sitting and waiting to see what happens are two different approaches to achieving success. Each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to consider these factors when deciding which approach to take.

Working towards a goal requires effort and dedication. It involves setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals and taking action to achieve them. This approach can be seen in Thomas Jefferson's quote, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" By continuously working towards a goal, one can learn from their mistakes and find new ways to achieve success.

On the other hand, sitting and waiting to see what happens can also lead to success, but it is not as reliable as actively working towards a goal. This approach can be seen in the saying, ""Fortune favors the brave."" By taking risks and being proactive, one can increase their chances of achieving success.

Both approaches have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Working towards a goal requires effort and dedication, but it can also lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Sitting and waiting to see what happens can lead to unexpected opportunities, but it can also lead to missed opportunities and a lack of control over one's destiny.

In conclusion, both working towards a goal and sitting and waiting to see what happens have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. It is important to consider which approach aligns best with one's personal goals and values. As Thomas Jefferson once said, ""The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."" By actively working towards a goal, one can increase their chances of achieving success and finding fulfillment in life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

So, like, let's face it. Phones are like, a big part of our lives nowadays. And, I mean, why not let us use them during lunch and free time in middle school? I think it would be, like, super convenient for teachers and stuff. They wouldn't have to keep track of us and stuff, and we could just, like, use our phones to learn stuff. 🤓

But, like, there are also some downsides to it. For example, if we're too distracted by our phones, we might not pay attention in class and stuff. And, like, what if someone's phone goes off during class? That's just, like, super rude and distracting. 🙄

And, like, some schools have already tried this and it didn't work out so well. They found that students were, like, way too distracted by their phones and it affected their grades and stuff. So, like, maybe it's not the best idea after all. 🤔

But, like, I still think it could be, like, okay if we're allowed to use our phones during lunch and free time. It's just, like, a way for us to, like, relax and stuff. And, like, who doesn't love Instagram and TikTok? 😂

So, like, in conclusion, I think allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time in middle school could be, like, both good and bad. It's just, like, something to think about. 🤔 Thanks for reading, I guess! 😅",1,llama2_chat,0
"The warm sun on my skin and the sounds of nature around me was refreshing. I was so excited for this outdoor adventure with my friends. We decided to take a bike ride around town and see the sights. As we rode, we talked about our goals and accomplishments, and made jokes about the days we'd had. 

We stopped by the local park and sat at the picnic tables, snacking on snacks and taking in the fresh air. Other people were there too, and I was excited to meet new people. We started to play some of our favorite icebreaker games, getting to know each other. 

By the end of the day, I was filled with a sense of peace and contentment. Taking outdoor activities with friends, family, or by yourself is the best way to enjoy nature and the weather.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

"Extending the school day is a controversial issue that has been gaining attention in recent years. On the one hand, it can provide additional time for teachers to cover topics in more depth. It can also give students the opportunity to explore new extracurricular activities. On the other hand, it can lead to issues such as student fatigue and an increased workload for students and teachers. 

Proponents of extending the school day argue that the extra time provided can help students get tutoring or extra help from teachers if needed. It can also allow schools to introduce enrichment activities such as field trips, robotics, music, and art. With more instructional time available, students can explore more in-depth subject matter and may even get the chance to explore topics that are often omitted from the standard curriculum. 

Opponents, however, express concern that extending the school day would lead to increased student fatigue. With the current school day already being long, any additional time can be taxing on students' energy levels and school performance. These students may end up feeling exhausted and demotivated, which could lead to a decrease in their academic performance. It could also lead to mental health concerns if students don't have adequate rest and leisure time. 

It is important to remember that extending the school day has many advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision to extend the school day should take into account the unique requirements and needs of each school community. Educators and parents should carefully consider all the pros and cons before making a decision on this issue.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"School lunches have been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that school lunches should be healthier, while others believe that they should be left alone. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of changing school lunch to a healthier option, and consider the effects of the change on students with different religions, races, and body types. I will also identify possible solutions to ensuring that all students are able to eat healthily in the cafeteria, including the possibility of offering food from around the world.

One of the main arguments in favor of changing school lunch to a healthier option is that it would improve the overall health of students. Currently, many school lunches are high in calories, sugar, and salt. This can lead to a variety of health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. By offering healthier options, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, students would be more likely to make healthy choices and maintain a healthy weight.

However, there are also some potential downsides to changing school lunch to a healthier option. For example, some students may not like the taste of the new foods, or they may not have the financial means to purchase them. Additionally, some students may have religious or cultural beliefs that conflict with the new menu options. For example, some students may not eat meat, or they may follow a specific diet for religious reasons.

To address these concerns, it may be necessary to offer a variety of healthy options that accommodate different dietary needs and preferences. For example, schools could offer vegetarian or vegan options, as well as options for students with gluten intolerance or other dietary restrictions. Additionally, schools could offer food from around the world, which would provide students with a wider range of healthy options to choose from.

In conclusion, changing school lunch to a healthier option has both pros and cons. While it would improve the overall health of students, it could also pose challenges for students with different dietary needs and preferences. To ensure that all students are able to eat healthily in the cafeteria, schools should offer a variety of healthy options that accommodate different dietary needs and preferences. Additionally, schools could offer food from around the world, which would provide students with a wider range of healthy options to choose from.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Failure and enthusiasm, two seemingly opposing concepts, are actually intertwined in the pursuit of success. Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement highlights the crucial role that failure plays in achieving success.

On one hand, failure can be a major obstacle in the path to success. It can lead to disappointment, discouragement, and a loss of motivation. However, as Churchill so eloquently put it, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue trying that ultimately leads to success. When we fail, we learn from our mistakes and use them as opportunities to improve. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This mindset is key to overcoming failure and achieving success.

On the other hand, enthusiasm is essential for maintaining the drive and motivation necessary to pursue success. When we are enthusiastic about something, we are more likely to put in the effort required to achieve our goals. Enthusiasm fuels our passion and determination, allowing us to push through challenges and overcome obstacles. Without enthusiasm, we may become complacent and give up too easily.

So, how do we balance the role of failure and enthusiasm in the pursuit of success? The key is to embrace failure as a learning opportunity and maintain a positive attitude. When we fail, we should not become discouraged or give up. Instead, we should use failure as a stepping stone to success. By continuing to work hard and stay enthusiastic, we can turn failure into a valuable learning experience.

In conclusion, failure and enthusiasm are two crucial elements in the pursuit of success. While failure can be a major obstacle, it is also a valuable learning opportunity. By embracing failure and maintaining a positive attitude, we can turn setbacks into stepping stones and achieve our goals. As Churchill said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" So, let us embrace failure and enthus",1,llama2_chat,1
"In a world of instant digital connection and interaction, it is more difficult than ever to remain true to oneself. With each new advancement in technology, social norms and cultural expectations shift alongside it, forcing us to constantly adjust to the influences around us. Social media can be especially challenging, as users are often encouraged to present the ""best"" version of themselves to the world, at the cost of authentically expressing their true feelings and beliefs. It can become tiresome to constantly keep up with the trends, and comparing ourselves to our peers can begin to affect our self-confidence and well-being. 

This need to appear perfect and accepted by society can have lasting effects on our self-perception and can impede our journey to discovering our true identity. It is essential to take time away from the chaos of the world and to remember to breathe, reflect, and to embrace being our genuine selves. The key to facing our difficulties head-on and staying centred during this time of great change is to remember that, despite the shifting of norms, it’s completely okay to be ourselves.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I have come to understand that failure is an essential part of the journey to success. This idea was famously expressed by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who stated that success consists of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasm. In this essay, I will explore how failure can lead to success by helping us understand what success is, the consequences of failing, and the importance of persevering when striving for success.

Firstly, failure helps us understand what success is. When we fail, we are forced to reflect on what went wrong and what we could have done differently. This reflection can help us to identify what success looks like and what it takes to achieve it. For example, if we fail to study for an exam, we may realize that success requires hard work and dedication. If we fail to complete a project on time, we may understand that success requires effective time management and planning.

Secondly, failure can have consequences that can help us to grow and develop. Failing can teach us valuable lessons that we can apply in the future. For example, if we fail to ask for help when we need it, we may learn the importance of seeking support from others. If we fail to take risks, we may learn the value of stepping outside of our comfort zones. These lessons can help us to become more resilient and better equipped to handle future challenges.

Finally, perseverance is essential when striving for success. When we face failure, it can be easy to give up and move on to something else. However, successful people know that perseverance is key to achieving their goals. As Churchill said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" By continuing to push forward despite setbacks, we can eventually achieve our goals and experience the satisfaction of success.

In conclusion, failure can be a valuable tool in our journey to success. It helps us to understand what success is, the consequences of failing, and the importance of persevering when striving for success. As Churchill said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" By embracing failure and persevering through it, we can ultimately achieve our goals and experience the joy of success.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Thomas Jefferson was the third president of the United States and one of the Founding Fathers of the nation. He led a remarkable life full of impressive accomplishments that exemplify the principle of “doing work always”. The founding of the University of Virginia, for example, was a testament to the less popular slogan, “never tire of doing work”. Jefferson’s unwavering diligence shaped the future of education in the United States and set an example for generations to come. 

This idea of “doing work always” has benefitted many people throughout history, from famous politicians to humble citizens. Throughout Jefferson’s lifetime, the hardworking people around him believed that “working hard” was the surest path to achieving success. Similarly, hard work has played an important role in inspiring the success of countless individuals, from 19th century poet Walt Whitman to modern-day entrepreneur Steve Jobs, revealing the power of “doing work always”. 
 
In contrast, the consequences of “not doing work always” can have negative effects on individuals and society. On the individual level, a lack of hard work can prevent us from achieving our goals and lead to stagnation and dissatisfaction with life. On the society level, it can lead to lack of innovation and progress, which can be especially problematic in a rapidly-evolving world. 

Personally, I have seen the impact of “doing work always” firsthand. It has been the cornerstone of my education and career, continually pushing me to reach higher and try harder. I have experienced countless successes, all highlighting the power of “doing work always” and the amazing things that can be accomplished through hard work and dedication.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey there!  So, I'm gonna write this essay about Emerson's quote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already done, you are not going to find out what you are capable of."" 

First off, I totally agree with Emerson because, like, if you don't push yourself to do new things, you'll never know how awesome you can be.  For instance, I used to be really into drawing, but I never thought I could actually paint. So, I took a risk and tried it out, and it turned out to be super fun!  Now, I'm actually pretty good at it. 

Another reason I agree with Emerson is that, if you don't try new things, you'll miss out on so many opportunities. Like, there are so many cool clubs and activities in school, but I never tried them out because I thought I wouldn't be good at them.  But then, I saw some of my friends having a blast at a club meeting, and I was like, ""Dang, I'm missing out!""  So, I decided to give it a shot, and now I'm the president of the club!  It's been super fun and has taught me so much. 

Lastly, trying something beyond what you have already done can help you discover your true potential. Like, I never thought I could be a good public speaker, but then I had to give a presentation in front of the whole class, and it turned out to be way easier than I thought!  Now, I'm actually pretty confident in my speaking skills, and I'm even thinking about joining the debate team. 

So, the impact of trying something beyond what you have already done is that it can help you find out what you're truly capable of, open up new opportunities, and help you discover your true potential.  It's like, if you don't take risks and try new things, you'll never know what you're missing out on.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Technology has changed the way we communicate, research, and game. On one hand, its use has made information more accessible and enabled us to communicate faster and more efficiently. For example, social media platforms allow people from around the world to connect and share content instantly. Research can now be done online, and searching for data is far quicker and more convenient than ever before. Gaming has also become all the more immersive and interactive with the help of technology, and players can now enjoy a wider range of gaming experiences. 

On the other hand, technology can be a distraction for some people. For example, communication through social media can be superficial and lacks the personal interaction of face-to-face communication. The sheer amount of data available online can also be overwhelming, and it can be difficult to sieve through and verify all of the facts. Furthermore, some gaming platforms can be addictive and can quickly become more important to people than activities such as physical exercise or pursuing other hobbies. 

In conclusion, technology has its pros and cons. It has made our lives easier in many ways, but it can also be a hindrance, especially if it is not used responsibly.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always enjoyed spending time outdoors, and playing a sport in a community park is one of the most enjoyable ways to do so. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why playing a sport in a community park is an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors.

First and foremost, playing a sport in a community park allows individuals to engage in physical activity and exercise. Exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy body and mind, and playing a sport is an excellent way to achieve this. Additionally, engaging in physical activity outdoors in a community park can be a fun and social way to spend time with friends and family.

Secondly, community parks provide a sense of community and belonging. They are often located in the heart of neighborhoods and are accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. Playing a sport in a community park allows individuals to connect with their community and feel a sense of pride in their neighborhood.

Thirdly, community parks offer a variety of sports and activities to choose from. Whether you are interested in playing soccer, basketball, or tennis, there is likely a sport or activity available at a community park. This variety allows individuals to try new things and find activities that they enjoy.

Lastly, playing a sport in a community park can be a stress-relieving and enjoyable way to spend time outdoors. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress and improve mood, and playing a sport in a community park can provide a fun and social outlet for stress relief. Additionally, spending time outdoors in a community park can provide a sense of peace and tranquility, allowing individuals to enjoy the beauty of nature.

In conclusion, playing a sport in a community park is an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors. It allows individuals to engage in physical activity, connect with their community, try new things, and relieve stress. As an eighth-grade student, I highly recommend playing a sport in a community park as a fun and enjoyable way to spend time outdoors.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

"Learning art is a valuable and enriching experience that can be enjoyed by all ages. Throughout history, different types of art classes have emerged, including painting, woodworking, music, drama, and even dance. Famous expressionists such as Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo have helped to promote the importance of art for generations. Musical instruments such as the harp and the flute can often be found in art classes, as well as popular plays like ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""The Comedy of Errors"". 

Taking an elective course provides a much more beneficial experience when compared to a required class. Electives allow students to choose classes that offer more interests and learning opportunities that are not necessarily offered in the required classes. This allows them to explore different activities that they may not normally seek out, encouraging them to develop new skills and gain knowledge outside of their traditionally structured courses. 

Additionally, allowing students to choose their own electives gives them a level of autonomy, helping to foster independence and creativity. It provides an opportunity for students to find classes that are engaging and stimulating for them, which can lead to more involved learning. This is far more beneficial to having a required class, where the content may not be viewed as exciting or engaging by the student, resulting in a lack of interest and in worse case scenarios, failure.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Online classes and video conferencing have revolutionized the way students learn and interact with their teachers and peers. With the rise of remote learning, students can now access high-quality education from the comfort of their own homes, without having to worry about transportation or other logistical issues. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of online classes and video conferencing for students, particularly those who are unable to attend school due to lack of transportation or other extenuating circumstances.

One of the most significant advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can take classes from anywhere with an internet connection, which means they can continue their education even if they are unable to physically attend school. This is particularly beneficial for students who live in remote areas or have mobility issues. For example, a student who lives in a rural area may not have access to a school within a reasonable distance, but with online classes, they can still receive a quality education.

Another benefit of online classes is the ability to minimize distractions. In a traditional classroom setting, students may be easily distracted by their peers or other environmental factors. However, with online classes, students can learn in a quiet and focused environment, which can lead to better retention of information and improved grades. Additionally, online classes can provide a more personalized learning experience, as teachers can tailor the content to the individual needs of each student.

Online classes and video conferencing can also benefit teens who are victims of bullying. In a traditional classroom setting, bullying can be a significant source of stress and anxiety for students. However, with online classes, students can avoid the bullying that may occur in the classroom, which can lead to a more comfortable and supportive learning environment. Additionally, online classes can provide a sense of anonymity, which can help students feel more comfortable opening up about their experiences and seeking help when needed.

Finally, online classes and video conferencing can provide a more accessible and inclusive learning environment. Traditional classrooms may not be accessible to students with disabilities, but with online classes, students can access high-quality education from anywhere. Additionally, online classes can provide a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, as students from different backgrounds and cultures can come together to learn and share ideas.

"As an 8th grader, I'm excited to research the various job opportunities available to me after high school. It's important to know what options are out there so I can make informed decisions about my future. After researching, I found that there are many pros and cons to each occupation, and two that really interest me are being a software developer and a nurse.

Being a software developer sounds like a great job because it's in high demand and can be done remotely. I could work from home and still make a good living. Plus, I enjoy learning new things and problem-solving, which are skills that are essential for this job. However, it can be stressful and require long hours, which might not be for everyone.

On the other hand, being a nurse is also a great option. Nurses are always in demand and can work in a variety of settings, from hospitals to clinics. It's a job that's both rewarding and stable, and I could make a real difference in people's lives. Plus, it's a job that's not too stressful, which is important to me. However, it can be emotionally challenging at times, and I might have to work long hours or night shifts.

I think schools can better provide students with career choices by offering more career counseling and job shadowing opportunities. This would help students like me learn more about different occupations and figure out what we're interested in. It would also be helpful if schools provided more resources for students who are interested in specific fields, such as software development or nursing. This could include internships or mentorship programs that would give us hands-on experience and help us build connections in our chosen fields.

It's important for students to attend school to ensure future success because it provides us with the skills and knowledge we need to succeed in our chosen careers. School teaches us how to problem-solve, communicate effectively, and work well with others, which are all essential skills for any job. Additionally, attending school gives us access to resources and opportunities that we might not have otherwise, such as internships, job shadowing, and career counseling.

7. Compare and contrast the violin with other musical instruments you've played or are interested in playing.
8. Discuss the benefits of playing the violin and how it has impacted your life.

The violin is a beautiful and versatile musical instrument that has a rich history and background. It is believed to have originated in the 15th century in Italy, where it was used in both religious and secular settings. The violin quickly gained popularity and was later adopted by various European countries, including France and Germany. Today, it is played by millions of people around the world and is considered one of the most popular musical instruments.

As an 8th-grade student, I can reflect back on my childhood memories and explain how I gained an interest in the violin. I was always fascinated by music and enjoyed listening to various genres, including classical, jazz, and pop. One day, I watched a performance by a violinist at a local concert, and I was immediately captivated by the sound of the instrument. I knew that I wanted to learn how to play the violin and began taking lessons shortly after.

To become proficient in the violin, I needed to develop several skills, including proper posture, finger technique, and intonation. It took a lot of practice and dedication to master these skills, but with the guidance of my violin teacher, I was able to make progress over time. I also had to learn how to read sheet music and understand the different parts of the violin, such as the neck, body, and strings.

My first experiences taking violin lessons were both exciting and challenging. I was eager to learn, but also felt a bit nervous and unsure of what to expect. My teacher was patient and encouraging, and helped me to build a strong foundation of skills. We started with the basics, such as holding the instrument properly and learning how to produce sound. As I progressed, we moved on to more advanced techniques, such as playing scales and arpeggios.

Not practicing the violin regularly can have detrimental consequences. Without regular practice, the muscles used to play the instrument can become weak and stiff, making it difficult to produce a clear and expressive sound. Additionally, not practicing can lead to a lack of creativity and a stagn",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

"Failure is an inevitable part of life, but it is not the end of the road. In fact, failure can often be a stepping stone towards success. Determination, encouragement, enthusiasm, and hard work are essential components of achieving success in life, as exemplified by the spider that kept trying to reach its goal.

Determination is the driving force behind success. It is the ability to keep pushing forward even when faced with obstacles and setbacks. The spider in our example never gave up, even when it failed multiple times. Instead, it continued to try and try again until it finally succeeded. Determination is not just about pushing through the tough times, but also about believing in oneself and having the confidence to keep going.

Encouragement is another important factor in achieving success. It is the support and motivation that comes from others, whether it be friends, family, or mentors. The spider in our example likely received encouragement from other spiders or insects that it encountered on its journey. This encouragement gave it the strength to keep going and to believe that it could succeed. Encouragement is not just about cheering someone on, but also about providing guidance and advice to help them achieve their goals.

Enthusiasm is the passion and excitement that drives individuals towards their goals. It is the energy and motivation that comes from having a clear vision of what one wants to achieve. The spider in our example was likely filled with enthusiasm as it worked towards its goal. This enthusiasm helped to fuel its determination and hard work, and ultimately led to its success. Enthusiasm is not just about being passionate about a goal, but also about having the drive to turn that passion into action.

Hard work is the final piece of the puzzle when it comes to achieving success. It is the effort and dedication that is required to turn a goal into a reality. The spider in our example spent countless hours spinning its web, trying to reach its goal. This hard work ultimately paid off, as it was able to catch its prey and succeed. Hard work is not just about putting in the time, but also about being disciplined and focused in one's efforts.

In conclusion, the spider in our example serves as a powerful metaphor for the importance of determination, encouragement, enthusiasm, and hard work in achieving success. These four components are essential for",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"In today's fast-paced world, people are constantly striving to be productive and efficient. However, the question remains whether being constantly active or taking breaks is more beneficial in achieving these goals. In my opinion, a combination of both approaches is necessary to accomplish more in life.

Firstly, staying on track in school is crucial to academic success. Students who are constantly active and engaged in their studies tend to perform better academically. They are more likely to attend class, complete assignments on time, and participate in extracurricular activities. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recharge. Taking a break from studying can help prevent burnout and improve focus and productivity when we return to our work.

Secondly, working hard like a parent is essential to achieving personal and professional goals. Parents who are constantly active and engaged in their children's lives tend to have more successful children. They are more likely to be involved in their children's education, provide a stable home environment, and set a good example for their children to follow. Similarly, individuals who work hard and are constantly active in their careers tend to achieve more success and advancement opportunities. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to relax and recharge. Taking a break from work can help prevent burnout and improve job satisfaction when we return to our work.

Finally, getting things done like a soccer player requires a combination of both approaches. Soccer players who are constantly active and engaged in their training tend to perform better on the field. They are more likely to practice regularly, stay in shape, and develop their skills. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recover. Taking a break from training can help prevent injuries and improve performance when we return to our training.

In conclusion, being constantly active or taking breaks is necessary to accomplish more in life. A combination of both approaches is necessary to achieve success in school, work, and other areas of life. It is important to find a balance between being active and taking breaks to prevent burnout and improve productivity. By understanding the importance of both approaches, we can achieve our goals and lead a fulfilling life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As an eighth-grade student, the idea of committing to a career at a young age may seem daunting. However, it is a topic that has been debated for years, and there are both pros and cons to consider. In this essay, I will examine the arguments for and against committing to a career at a young age.

On the one hand, committing to a career at a young age can have many benefits. For one, it allows individuals to focus their efforts on achieving their goals and gaining the necessary skills and experience to succeed in their chosen field. This can lead to a more efficient and effective career path, as individuals are able to quickly identify and pursue their passions. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can provide a sense of direction and purpose, which can be beneficial for both personal and professional growth.

On the other hand, committing to a career at a young age can also have its drawbacks. For one, it can limit an individual's ability to explore other options and pursue different paths. It can also lead to a lack of flexibility and adaptability, as individuals may become too focused on their chosen career and be unwilling to make changes or take on new challenges. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can put pressure on individuals to succeed, which can lead to stress and burnout.

In conclusion, the decision to commit to a career at a young age is a complex one that requires careful consideration of both the pros and cons. While it can provide focus and direction, it can also limit opportunities and put pressure on individuals to succeed. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to weigh the benefits and drawbacks and make a decision that is best for their personal and professional goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Homework clubs, where students can gather to work on school assignments, have been shown to offer a number of potential benefits. Students that take part in organized homework clubs display increased engagement in school and improved academic performance. Studies have also shown that these clubs reduce feelings of isolation and stress, and can provide students with a better sense of community during their school years. From the teacher perspective, the availability of a homework club can provide a greater opportunity to monitor students’ work, and to ensure they can catch up on course work if they miss classes. 

At the same time, there are some potential drawbacks. Teachers may not be available to help with specific coursework during homework clubs, thus making it difficult for students to access help for questions related to the subject material. Moreover, a lack of resources or funding may limit the effectiveness of the program, or make it difficult to sustain long-term. 

It is important to consider all the potential pros and cons of having a homework club in schools as part of an overall approach to student engagement, mental health, and academic success. With proper resources, teachers’ availability, and student engagement, the benefits of a homework club may outweigh the risks.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"When it comes to forming relationships, making first impressions is essential. People often form impressions of each other within seconds of meeting. This includes judging things such as clothing, hairstyle, body language, and the tone used in conversation. It's easy to make a first impression, but it can be challenging to change that impression afterwards. 

When navigating a situation like this, one strategy is to find reasons to have a second conversation. This gives another chance to make a favorable impression. Achieving a successful connection is all about finding common ground and showing genuine interest in the other person. 

For example, one student was able to change her first impression on an interviewer after an initial conversation went badly. She researched the interviewer, identified common interest, and prepared thoughtful questions to get the conversation flowing. She made sure to not only remain engaged throughout the conversation, but also demonstrate her knowledge of the field. 

Finally, although making a positive impression is important, it is also important to remember that it is not everything. Do not put too much focus or attention into a first impression as it can limit the mutual understanding that comes from further conversation. It is also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and should be given chances to redeem themselves.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new and you get that one chance to make a good impression. But, like, what happens when that first impression is totally off? Like, what if you come across as super boring or weird? Can you change that first impression, or is it like, set in stone? 💔

So, I think first impressions are kind of like, impossible to change. Like, once you make that first impression, it's out there and it's hard to take it back. For example, if you show up late to a party and you're all sweaty and out of breath, it's gonna be hard to change that first impression. People are gonna think you're, like, irresponsible or something. 🙄

But, on the other hand, sometimes first impressions can be changed. Like, if you show up to a job interview super early and dressed to impress, people might think you're super eager and motivated. Or, if you're in a new social situation and you're able to, like, quickly make someone laugh or something, it can change that first impression. 😂

So, it's like, kind of a mix of both. First impressions are hard to change, but they can also be changed if you, like, put in the effort. It's important to be aware of that first impression and try to make a good one, or at least a good enough one that you can build on it later. 🤔

In conclusion, first impressions are like, a big deal. They can make or break how people see you, and it's important to be mindful of them. But, it's also important to remember that they're not always set in stone, and you can always try to change them if you want to. 😃

"In today's society, conformity is often prioritized over individuality. This is evident in various aspects of our daily lives, including education, media, and social interactions. While conformity can have its benefits, such as promoting social cohesion and reducing conflict, it can also stifle creativity and personal growth.

One example of conformity in education is the emphasis on standardized testing. While these tests are meant to measure a student's knowledge and skills, they often place a high value on rote memorization and conformity to a specific format. This can lead to a narrow focus on certain subjects and a lack of emphasis on critical thinking and creativity. Additionally, the pressure to achieve high test scores can lead to cheating and other unethical behavior, further promoting conformity over individuality.

In the media, we see countless examples of conformity, particularly in the entertainment industry. Many popular TV shows and movies follow a familiar formula, with predictable plot twists and character archetypes. This can lead to a lack of originality and creativity in storytelling, as well as a homogenization of cultural values and norms. Furthermore, the pressure to conform to certain beauty standards and body types can lead to unhealthy and harmful messages about self-image and self-worth.

In social interactions, conformity can manifest in various ways, such as the pressure to fit in with a particular group or to conform to certain social norms and expectations. This can lead to a lack of authenticity and individuality, as people may feel the need to hide their true selves in order to fit in. Additionally, conformity can lead to groupthink and a lack of independent decision-making, as people may be more likely to follow the lead of others rather than thinking for themselves.

In conclusion, while conformity can have its benefits, it is often prioritized over individuality in our current society. This is evident in various aspects of our daily lives, including education, media, and social interactions. While conformity can lead to social cohesion and reduced conflict, it can also stifle creativity and personal growth. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between conformity and individuality, and to prioritize authenticity and self-expression in all aspects of their lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2

One particular skill I have is public speaking. To improve this skill, I plan on taking a speech class with a focus on communication techniques. I was also surprised to discover that there could be a world record associated with a skill I possess. After a bit of research, I found that there is a world record for holding the most books in one hand, which I am pretty sure I can beat! 

I have also looked for ways to combine skills or talents that I may not have thought of before, such as combining public speaking with musical performance. This type of performance could lead to exciting opportunities for me in the future. I have also researched how I can become better than others in the same fields as me. After researching potential avenues for doing this, I have found methods that could help me to become the expert in whichever skills or talents I may possess. 

Finally, I have also looked at ways to develop any new skills or abilities that I may not currently possess. By doing this, I am opening myself up to new experiences and opportunities that I may not have been able to take advantage of otherwise.

"Title: The Power of Failure: How It Leads to Success

Introduction:
Hey, guys! Today, I'm going to talk about something that might seem kind of weird, but trust me, it's really important – failure. Yeah, you heard that right. Failure. It's like, the opposite of success, right? But actually, it's not. Failure can be the key to success. Like, think about it. If you never failed, you wouldn't learn anything new. And if you never learned anything new, you wouldn't be able to succeed. So, failure is actually super important.

Main Points:

First, let's talk about how failure can help you learn new things. When you fail, you figure out what didn't work, and you can try again. It's like, trial and error, right? And the more you try, the better you get. For example, I tried out for the school soccer team last year, but I didn't make it. At first, I was really upset, but then I realized that I could use that experience to improve my skills and try out again next year. And guess what? I made it this year!

Another thing that's cool about failure is that it can help you be more creative. When you're not afraid to take risks and try new things, you can come up with some really cool ideas. Like, think about Steve Jobs and Apple. They failed a lot before they became successful, but they kept trying until they got it right. And now, they're one of the most successful companies in the world!

Personal Experience:
Okay, so one time, I tried to make a really cool science project for school, but it didn't turn out how I wanted it to. I spent like, hours on it, and it just didn't work. But instead of getting mad or giving up, I decided to use it as an opportunity to learn. I figured out what went wrong, and I tried again. And this time, it worked! It was like, a total success!

Successful Entrepreneur Example:
Another example of someone who learned from failure is J.K. Rowling. She got rejected by like, every publisher in the UK",1,llama2_chat,1
"Ugh, I don't wanna write another essay, but I guess it's for a good cause. 

So, um, eating healthier food is, like, super important for our bodies and stuff. It helps us grow strong and smart and all that jazz. And, like, our school lunches are not exactly the healthiest. I mean, don't get me wrong, they're not horrible or anything, but they could definitely be better.

I did some research and found out that a lot of the food we eat at school is processed and has a bunch of unhealthy stuff in it. Like, did you know that some of the sandwiches have, like, a million grams of sodium?! And the fruit cups are usually just, like, a handful of grapes or something. It's not like they're giving us a lot of nutrients or anything.

So, I think we should try to improve the school lunch menu. Maybe they could offer more fruits and veggies, and less processed food. And they could definitely cut down on the sodium and sugar. I mean, who doesn't love a good cookie, but like, maybe one a week or something? Not every day!

I think we should present our findings to the principal and try to get him to make a change. I know he's busy and all, but like, our health is important too! And I'm sure he wouldn't want us to be eating all that unhealthy food every day.

I don't know, maybe we could make a poster or something and present it to him. Or we could even make a video. I saw this one video online where kids made a whole presentation about how to eat healthier and it was really cool. I could totally do that!

"Ummm... Okay!  Here's my essay:

The greatest accomplishment in the world is being yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are.  I mean, think about it. Everywhere you turn, there are people telling you who you should be, what you should like, and how you should act. Social media is filled with curated versions of people's lives, making it seem like everyone else is living their best life except for you.  It's like, how are we supposed to keep up?!

But here's the thing: being yourself is hard. It's hard to be different, to stand out, to not fit in.  But it's also the most important thing you can do. When you're true to yourself, you're not trying to be someone you're not. You're not wasting time and energy pretending to be someone else. You're not trying to fit into a mold that doesn't even exist. 

I mean, think about it. Have you ever met someone who's trying to be someone they're not? They're always faking it, always putting on a show. And it's exhausting!  It's like, can't they just be themselves already?! 

But when you're yourself, you're free. You're free to be weird, to be quirky, to be different. You're free to be you. And that's the greatest accomplishment in the world. 

So, next time you're feeling like you don't fit in, just remember: being yourself is the coolest thing you can do.  It's like, the world may be trying to change you, but you don't have to let it. You can be yourself, no matter what.

"Honesty is a crucial value that we should all strive to uphold in our everyday lives. It's the foundation of trust and respect, and without it, our relationships and interactions with others suffer. When we are honest, we build trust and credibility with others, which is essential for any healthy relationship.

One example of the importance of honesty is in our personal relationships. When we are honest with our friends and family, they know they can rely on us and trust us. For instance, if a friend asks you if they look fat in a dress, it's better to be honest and tell them the truth, even if it might be hurtful, than to lie and damage their trust in you. In the long run, being honest will strengthen your relationship and show your friend that you truly care about them.

Another example is in the workplace. Being honest with your coworkers and superiors is crucial for building a positive work environment. When you are truthful about your accomplishments and challenges, you earn the respect of your colleagues and superiors, which can lead to better opportunities and growth. On the other hand, lying and exaggerating your accomplishments can damage your reputation and lead to disciplinary actions.

However, honesty is not always the easiest choice, especially when it's difficult or uncomfortable. For instance, if a friend asks you to lie about something to protect them, it can be tempting to go along with it. But in the end, honesty is always the best choice, even if it's hard. When we lie, we risk damaging our relationships and losing the trust of those around us.

The consequences of lying can be severe. When we lie, we risk damaging our reputation and relationships, and we may even face legal consequences. For example, if we lie under oath in a court of law, we can face perjury charges. In addition, lying can also affect our self-esteem and mental health, as we may feel guilty and anxious about keeping up the lie.

In conclusion, honesty is a vital value that we should uphold in our everyday lives. It builds trust and respect, and it's the best choice, even when it's difficult. By being honest, we can build strong relationships and a positive reputation, and",1,llama2_chat,3
"In his famous essay ""Self-Reliance,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson argues that in order to grow and achieve true success, one must ""try to do something beyond what you have already mastered."" This idea suggests that we should constantly strive to learn and expand our knowledge, rather than becoming complacent and content with what we already know. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of going beyond one's current knowledge and provide an example of how it has helped me.

Firstly, expanding one's knowledge can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. When we push ourselves to learn new things, we challenge ourselves and prove to ourselves that we are capable of achieving more than we thought possible. This sense of accomplishment can be incredibly motivating and can lead to further growth and development.

Secondly, going beyond one's current knowledge can also lead to a greater understanding of the world around us. By exploring new ideas and perspectives, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of the world and the people in it. This increased understanding can help us make more informed decisions and become more effective problem solvers.

Finally, expanding one's knowledge can also lead to new opportunities and experiences. When we are open to learning new things, we may be introduced to new people, new cultures, and new ways of thinking. These experiences can broaden our horizons and help us develop a more diverse and open-minded perspective on the world.

Personally, I have found that going beyond my current knowledge has been incredibly beneficial. For example, when I was in 6th grade, I had always been interested in science, but had never really delved into the subject in depth. However, when I took an advanced science class in 7th grade, I was challenged to learn new concepts and ideas that I had never encountered before. At first, I found the material difficult to understand, but as I continued to work on the subject, I began to see the world in a new light. I realized that science was not just about facts and figures, but about understanding the underlying principles that govern our universe. This newfound understanding has not only helped me excel in my science classes, but has also helped me develop a greater appreciation for the world around me.

So, technology.  It's like, everywhere.  And it's definitely had a big impact on our lives.  Both good and bad, you know?

First, the good stuff.  Technology has made life so much easier in so many ways. Like, think about it. We can communicate with people all over the world in seconds.  That's crazy! And with all the apps and social media, it's like, we're never really alone.  Even when we're alone, we're still connected to the world. 

But,  there are also some pretty negative effects.  Like, have you seen how much time people spend on their phones?  It's like, they're not even present in the moment anymore.  And it's not just them.  We're all doing it.  It's like, we're all so addicted to our screens.

But,  there are also some really cool ways technology is changing things.  Like, have you heard of virtual reality?  It's like, you can experience things that are completely immersive.  And it's not just for gaming.  There are so many educational and therapeutic uses for it too.

"Influence, both positive and negative, is an unavoidable element of human interaction. Positive influence exists when people are uplifted and encouraged to accomplish goals or achieve desired behaviors; for example, a parent conveying to a child praise or words of support. This can be an invaluable tool in helping individuals develop their potential. Negative influence, meanwhile, can manifest as manipulation, coercion, or in cases of severe power inequity, even physical, mental, or emotional abuse; these can be particularly damaging as people can be coerced into damaging or dangerous behaviors that have both immediate and long-term consequences that can be detrimental to their well-being. 

The impact of influence on people can be far-reaching. Positive influence can provide people with the confidence and motivation to pursue opportunities in life and strive for success. Conversely, negative influence can be incredibly destructive, resulting in patterns of unhealthy behavior, low self-esteem, and disastrous decision-making. For this reason, it is important to be aware of the dangers of negative influence and the power of positive influence.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I know that mistakes are a natural part of life. I recently made a mistake in my English class, and it was a difficult experience for me. I had been working hard on a paper, and I was feeling confident in my abilities. However, when I turned it in, my teacher gave me a low score, and I was devastated.

At first, I was angry with my teacher and myself. I felt like I had wasted all of my time and effort on the paper. But as I thought more about it, I realized that I had learned a valuable lesson from my mistake. I had made assumptions about what my teacher was looking for in the paper, and I had not taken the time to thoroughly research and revise my work.

I decided to take the time to speak with my teacher and ask for feedback on my paper. She was happy to help me understand what I had done wrong and how I could improve in the future. I also took the time to research the topic more thoroughly and to revise my paper multiple times before turning it in.

In the end, my mistake taught me the importance of taking the time to learn from my mistakes. I realized that I cannot always benefit from mistakes, but when I do, it can be a valuable learning experience.

There are many examples of people who have benefited from their mistakes. For instance, Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before he successfully invented the lightbulb. Each time he failed, he learned something new and used that knowledge to improve his design.

In conclusion, mistakes are a natural part of life, and they can be a valuable learning experience. While not all mistakes can be beneficial, it is important to take the time to learn from them and to use that knowledge to improve in the future. As I continue to grow and learn, I will remember the lessons I have learned from my mistakes and use them to help me succeed in the future.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Summer vacations are a time for students to recharge and refresh their minds from the rigors of the school year. While some may argue that summer vacations are a waste of time, I believe that they have numerous advantages for students. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of familiar activities, job opportunities, and balancing students' personal and school lives. Additionally, I will explore the importance of finding an appropriate length of break to maximize students' progress.

One of the main advantages of summer vacations is the opportunity to engage in familiar activities. For many students, summer is a time to return to hobbies and interests that they may not have had time for during the school year. Whether it's playing sports, reading, or painting, these activities provide a sense of comfort and familiarity that can be beneficial for students' mental and emotional well-being. Engaging in these activities can also help students to develop their skills and talents, which can lead to greater success in school and beyond.

Another advantage of summer vacations is the increased job opportunities available to students. Many businesses and organizations offer summer internships and part-time jobs for students, which can provide valuable work experience and help them to develop important skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management. These experiences can also help students to make connections in their field of interest, which can be beneficial for their future career prospects.

Finally, summer vacations provide students with the opportunity to balance their personal and school lives. With the increased free time, students can focus on their academic pursuits and catch up on any missed work. They can also use this time to spend with friends and family, which can help to reduce stress and improve their overall well-being. Additionally, summer vacations can provide a much-needed break from the pressures of school, which can help students to return to class feeling refreshed and ready to learn.

However, it's important to note that the length of summer vacation can have an impact on students' progress. While longer vacations may provide more opportunities for relaxation and personal pursuits, they can also lead to a loss of academic momentum. On the other hand, shorter vacations may not provide enough time for students to recharge and may lead to increased stress and burnout. Therefore, it's important for students and educators to find a balance that works for them, taking into consideration the needs",1,llammistral7binstruct,2

First of all, let's talk about why they're even considering this in the first place.  I mean, I know they want us to learn more and all, but two more hours of school is just too much.  My brain is already fried from the usual eight hours we have to sit here and learn. Adding more time just means I'll be even more tired and grumpy in the evenings. 

And think about it, Mrs. Johnson.  Two more hours means we'll have to wake up even earlier.  Like, seriously, I already have to drag myself out of bed at 6:30 am.  Do we really need to make it even harder for ourselves?  No, no we don't. 

Plus, think about all the other stuff we could be doing with that extra time.  Like, we could be practicing sports or music or something.  Or we could just chill with our friends and have some fun.  I mean, school is important and all, but so is having a social life. 

And let's not forget about our parents.  They have to drive us to and from school, and now they'll have to do it even more.  Like, I get it, they want us to get a good education and all, but they also have their own lives to worry about.  They don't need to spend even more time and money on us.

"Taking one day off of school can have both positive and negative effects on students and teachers. While students may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload and maintain a consistent schedule. Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.

On one hand, taking one day off of school can provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation. This can lead to increased productivity and focus when they return to class, as well as improved mental and physical health. Moreover, a day off can give students a chance to catch up on any work they may have fallen behind on, or to pursue extracurricular activities that they may not have had time for otherwise.

However, taking one day off of school can also have negative consequences. Teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload that results from a school day off, such as grading papers, preparing for upcoming lessons, and communicating with students and parents. This can lead to increased stress and burnout, as well as a potential decrease in the quality of instruction.

Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear. While students and teachers may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, the impact on the environment and the school's resources may be minimal. This is particularly true if the school is already operating efficiently and using energy-efficient technologies.

In conclusion, taking one day off of school can have both positive and negative effects on students and teachers. While students may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload and maintain a consistent schedule. Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.

"Attending classes from home online or by video conference has many potential benefits. For example, it eliminates the need for students to physically attend a class on campus, saving time and money associated with traveling and living on campus. It also gives students more flexibility, as lectures and course materials can be accessed and reviewed at any time, rather than conforming to the constraints imposed by physical class schedules. 

However, online or video conference classes come with some limitations. For one, it can be more difficult to stay engaged and attentive when classes are held in a non-traditional environment. Additionally, students may find it more difficult to connect and collaborate with peers, as there is no face-to-face interaction.

Overall, I believe that classes from home online or by video conference should be available for all students. Even though there are some minor drawbacks, the convenience of being able to access classes on their own schedule and in their own space makes this an ideal option for students who want to take advantage of the latest educational opportunities.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"As an average 8th grade student, I have been pondering the potential effects of adding hours to our school schedules. While some may argue that it could positively impact our academic performance and extracurricular activities, I believe there are also potential negative consequences to consider.

On the positive side, adding more hours to our school days could allow for more time in the classroom, potentially leading to improved academic performance. With more time to learn and engage with the material, students may be able to better understand and retain the information presented. Additionally, longer school days could provide more opportunities for extracurricular activities, such as sports, clubs, and other interests, which are essential for a well-rounded education. These activities can help students develop important life skills, make new friends, and reduce stress.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Adding more hours to our school days could lead to increased fatigue and stress for students. With more time in the classroom, students may feel overwhelmed and burnt out, which could negatively impact their academic performance. Moreover, longer school days could make it difficult for students to balance their academic and extracurricular activities, leading to conflicts and stress.

Furthermore, adding hours to our school schedules could also have a negative impact on our overall quality of life. With more time spent in school, students may have less time for personal activities, such as hobbies, family time, and relaxation. This could lead to a decrease in overall well-being and happiness. Additionally, longer school days could make it difficult for students to maintain a healthy work-life balance, which is essential for long-term success.

In conclusion, while adding hours to our school schedules could potentially have some positive effects, such as improved academic performance and more opportunities for extracurricular activities, there are also potential negative consequences to consider. It is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons before making any decisions regarding our school schedules. As an average 8th grade student, I believe that finding a balance between academic rigor and personal well-being is crucial for a successful and fulfilling education.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Imagination is a powerful tool that has played a significant role in my life. It has helped me through difficult times and has given me hope when I needed it the most. I have learned to harness the power of imagination to overcome challenges and achieve success.

One of the most positive experiences I have had with imagination was when I was a child. I would spend hours reading books and imagining myself in the stories. I would become completely immersed in the world of the book, and it would transport me to a different place. This helped me to develop a love of reading and a vivid imagination.

However, imagination can also be a double-edged sword. When I was younger, I would often use my imagination to escape from reality. I would imagine myself in a different world, one where everything was perfect. While this helped me to cope with difficult situations, it also made it harder for me to face my problems head-on.

As I got older, I learned how to use my imagination in a more productive way. I started to use it to visualize my goals and imagine myself achieving them. This helped me to gain confidence in myself and my abilities. I began to believe that I could accomplish anything I set my mind to, and this gave me the motivation to work hard and achieve success.

One of the most difficult events in my life related to imagination was when I lost my ability to imagine. I had a traumatic experience that caused me to lose touch with my imagination. I struggled to find joy in anything, and I felt like my life was pointless. It was a dark time, and I didn't know how to get out of it.

But eventually, I found my way back to my imagination. I started to read again, and I began to imagine myself in new and exciting ways. I discovered that my imagination was not just a tool for escaping reality, but it was also a powerful tool for personal growth and self-discovery.

In conclusion, imagination has played a significant role in my life. It has helped me to overcome challenges and achieve success. While it can be a double-edged sword, I have learned how to use it in a more productive way. I have also learned that understanding the power of imagination can help me achieve my goals and live a fulfilling life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Adding variety to the school lunch menu has the potential to provide students with appealing, nutritional meals. To assess the needs of the student body, we conducted interviews with students to better understand what type of food they would like to see in the menu. Additionally, a survey was created to determine what type of food would be most popular among students. Popular menu items from the survey included hummus with pita bread, whole grain wraps, and vegetarian sushi. From these findings, five different foods were established to be added to the school lunch menu: pizza with whole wheat crust, vegan enchiladas, turkey sliders, bulgur salad, and eggplant parmesan. To explain how a new menu could benefit students, a presentation was created detailing the health benefits of the new menu items. With these menu additions, schools can offer students nutritious, interesting meals that they can look forward to in the lunchroom.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"With the implementation of a four-day school week, the conservation of energy and resources could be significantly enhanced. The extra two hours added to the school day could be used to provide additional instruction and educational activities, which might lead to a more efficient use of resources and energy. Furthermore, costs associated with transportation, such as gas and tolls, and food could be reduced as schools would only be open for four days each week.

However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of a four-day school week, particularly for students with part-time jobs. While the additional day off could give a student more time to pursue an after-school job, it could also result in fewer hours and less pay due to the extended school day. Ultimately, the potential benefits of a four-day school week must be weighed carefully against the consequences for students with part-time jobs.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"High school programs are designed to prepare students for college and beyond. With the increasing demand for higher education, many students are considering enrolling in accelerated programs that offer a shorter duration of studies. However, the decision to enroll in a 3-year high school program can be challenging as it comes with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of a 3-year high school program and offer my opinion on the matter.

One of the main benefits of a 3-year high school program is that it allows students to finish their high school studies in a shorter duration. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are eager to begin their college education or enter the workforce as soon as possible. By completing high school in three years instead of four, students can save time and money while still receiving a comprehensive education.

Another benefit of a 3-year high school program is that it offers a more accelerated pace of learning. Students who enroll in this type of program are required to take more advanced courses and complete them at a faster pace. This can help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as prepare them for the rigors of college coursework.

Despite the benefits, there are also potential drawbacks to consider when enrolling in a 3-year high school program. One of the main drawbacks is that students may feel rushed and overwhelmed by the accelerated pace of learning. This can lead to stress and burnout, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

Another potential drawback of a 3-year high school program is that students may not have enough time to explore their interests and passions. High school is a critical time for students to discover their strengths and weaknesses, as well as explore potential career paths. By completing high school in three years, students may not have the same opportunities to explore their interests and make informed decisions about their future.

In my opinion, enrolling in a 3-year high school program can be a beneficial decision for students who are eager to complete their high school studies quickly and move on to the next stage of their education or career. However, it is important for students to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks before making a decision. Students should also be prepared to work hard and manage their time effectively in order to",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that students should be required to take elective classes. While some may argue that students should be free to choose their own classes, I believe that elective classes provide numerous benefits to students, both academically and personally. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the pros and cons of students being required to take elective classes, research the educational benefits of taking elective classes, investigate ways that taking elective classes can help students with their future career paths, explore why some students may choose not to attend school due to uninteresting classes, and evaluate the impact of allowing students to choose their elective classes on their academic performance.

Firstly, let's compare and contrast the pros and cons of students being required to take elective classes. On one hand, being required to take elective classes can be seen as a negative, as students may not be interested in the subject matter. However, on the other hand, being required to take elective classes can also be seen as a positive, as it forces students to try new things and expand their horizons. Additionally, elective classes can help students discover their passions and interests, which can lead to more fulfilling and successful careers in the future.

Secondly, research has shown that taking elective classes can provide numerous educational benefits. For example, elective classes can help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as enhance their creativity and innovation. Additionally, elective classes can provide students with opportunities to learn from experts in their field and gain practical experience through internships or fieldwork.

Thirdly, taking elective classes can help students with their future career paths. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in the arts, they may choose to take an elective class in painting or music. Similarly, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in science, they may choose to take an elective class in biology or physics. By taking elective classes in their areas of interest, students can gain valuable skills and knowledge that can help them succeed in their future careers.

Fourthly, some students may choose not to attend school due to uninteresting classes. This can be a major problem, as students who are not engaged in their classes are less likely to learn and succeed academically. However, by requiring students to take elective classes,",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that taking care of a dog is a big responsibility, and it requires a lot of attention and effort. In order to ensure that my dog is healthy and happy, I have come up with a list of six things that I will do for my dog on a daily basis.

First and foremost, I will feed my dog a nutritious meal each day. A balanced diet is essential for a dog's health, and it will help them maintain a healthy weight and avoid any potential health problems. I will make sure that I am feeding my dog high-quality food that is appropriate for their age, breed, and activity level.

Second, I will provide my dog with cool water in the summer and regular water in the winter. During the hot summer months, it's important to keep your dog hydrated, so I will make sure that they always have access to cool water. In the winter, I will provide them with regular water to prevent them from getting dehydrated.

Third, I will take my dog on walks and allow them to go outside to do their business. Exercise is important for a dog's health, and it will help them maintain a healthy weight and release pent-up energy. I will make sure that I am taking my dog on walks regularly, and I will also allow them to go outside to do their business whenever they need to.

Fourth, I will spend time with my dog and allow them to feel my love and affection. Dogs are social animals, and they thrive on attention and affection. I will make sure that I am spending quality time with my dog each day, playing with them, petting them, and giving them lots of love and attention.

Fifth, I will provide my dog with toys and let them interact with family and friends. Dogs love to play and interact with people and other animals. I will make sure that I am providing my dog with a variety of toys to keep them entertained, and I will also allow them to interact with family and friends when possible.

"Sure, here is an essay I came up with as an average 8th grade student:

Extending the School Day: Pros and Cons

As an 8th grader, I've heard a lot of talk about extending the school day. Some people say it's a great idea, while others think it's a bad one. In my opinion, there are both pros and cons to extending the school day.

One of the main pros of extending the school day is that it would give students more time to learn. With more time in the classroom, we could cover more material and learn more things. For example, if we had an extra hour in the morning, we could do more math problems or read more chapters in our books. This would help us get better grades and be more prepared for standardized tests.

Another pro is that it would give teachers more time to teach. With a longer day, teachers could give more individual attention to students who need it, or they could teach more complex concepts. This would help students who are struggling in certain subjects and give them the extra support they need to succeed.

However, there are also some cons to extending the school day. One of the biggest cons is that it would take away from our free time. As it is, we have a lot of homework and extracurricular activities, and adding more time to the school day would just make things more hectic. We need time to relax and unwind after school, whether that's playing sports, hanging out with friends, or just doing nothing.

Another con is that it could be expensive. Extending the school day would likely cost money for things like new buildings or additional staff, and that could be a burden on taxpayers. It's important to think about how extending the school day would affect our community and whether it's really worth it.

In conclusion, extending the school day has both pros and cons. While it would give us more time to learn and teachers more time to teach, it would also take away from our free time and be expensive. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons before making a decision. As an 8th grader, I think it's important to have enough time to learn and have fun outside of school, but also to make sure that we're getting the",1,llama2_chat,1
"As many successful individuals have attested, success does not have to be the result of failure. Despite the often-used phrase, “failure leads to success,” there are in fact alternate routes to success that don’t involve failure. To understand how one can proceed towards success without defeatedly accepting the outcome of failure, it is first important to grasp what each path of success involves. 

There are three main paths to success – the traditional path of failing and learning, the path of recognition as a success without failure, and the path of breaking away from traditional success through failure. 

The traditional path to success is the belief that failure is part of the learning process, and that one should use their mistakes to move forward. This tends to be the most common route for success. It involves people accepting their failures as part of the journey and using them as learning points or guidance along the way. 

However, it is not necessary to accept failure as part of the journey to success. Recongition as a success without failure involves innovation and doing something that isn’t traditionally understood as a successful path. For example, an actor rejected from an audition may take up an instructional class or direct his own film, which could potentially lead to more recognition and fame than if he had simply followed the traditional success path. 

Finally, there’s the option to break away from traditional paths to success altogether. This often involves creative endeavors like painting, poetry and music, in which failure is not necessarily seen as something negative. In this route, success isn't measured in how well one improves from a mistake, but it’s success for the idea or vision in itself. 

Thus, it is possible to reach success without feeling the need to accept failure. Whether it’s through a certain type of recognition, breaking away from traditional paths, or any other creative routes, there are multiple ways towards success without defeat. Through determination and access to necessary resources, one can bypass the expected notion that failure leads to success, and achieve their goals through alternative paths.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Dear McDonald's Corporate Headquarters,

I am writing to you on behalf of the students at [Name of School], an 8th-grade class in [State/Country]. We are interested in organizing a field trip to one of your McDonald's locations as part of our ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the importance of education.

As you may know, education is a fundamental aspect of our lives, and it plays a crucial role in shaping our future. However, many young people today are not receiving the education they need to succeed. This is a problem that affects not only individuals but also society as a whole.

Our field trip to McDonald's would serve as a powerful illustration of the consequences of not receiving an education. We plan to visit one of your restaurants during a time when it is typically busy with customers. We will then conduct a series of activities and discussions designed to help students understand the importance of education and the impact it can have on their lives.

For example, we might have students work in small groups to analyze the menus and pricing at McDonald's. We could then discuss how the lack of education can make it difficult for people to make informed decisions about their health and finances. We might also have students role-play scenarios where they are faced with difficult decisions about their education and career paths.

We believe that this field trip would be a valuable learning experience for our students. It would provide them with a firsthand look at the consequences of not receiving an education and help them understand the importance of pursuing their education.

We would like to request your support in making this field trip a success. We would be grateful if you could provide us with any resources or materials that would help us plan and execute this trip. We would also appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss this proposal in more detail.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"Title: The Pros and Cons of a Four-Day Work Week with Ten-Hour Days in School

As an 8th grader, I find the idea of a four-day work week with ten-hour days in school to be intriguing. While it may seem like a dream come true to have more time off, there are several implications to consider. In this essay, I will explore the potential impacts on students with part-time jobs, energy and resource conservation, and the potential drawbacks of this new schedule.

Firstly, a four-day work week with ten-hour days could have a significant impact on students with part-time jobs. These students may struggle to balance their school workload with their job responsibilities, leading to increased stress and decreased academic performance. Additionally, they may have to work longer hours to make up for the lost day, which could negatively affect their sleep schedule and overall well-being.

Secondly, a five-day work week with eight hours per day is more energy-efficient than a four-day work week with ten hours per day. With five days of school, students and teachers can spread out their workload more evenly, reducing the amount of energy consumed in the classroom. On the other hand, a four-day work week with ten hours per day would require more energy to light and heat the school, leading to increased resource consumption.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. A four-day work week with ten-hour days could lead to a decrease in student engagement and motivation. Students may find it challenging to focus and learn in a shorter amount of time, leading to lower academic achievement. Additionally, a four-day work week could result in increased traffic and congestion on the roads, as students and teachers commute to and from school.

In conclusion, while a four-day work week with ten-hour days in school may have some benefits, such as increased energy efficiency and reduced stress for students with part-time jobs, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. These include decreased student engagement and motivation, increased traffic and congestion, and the impact on students with part-time jobs.

"As an eighth-grade student, I have had the opportunity to take classes online and via video conferencing. While this mode of learning has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of taking classes online or via video conferencing for those who are unable to attend school in person.

One of the main advantages of taking classes online or via video conferencing is the flexibility it provides. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which eliminates the need for a commute. This can be especially beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who live in areas with limited transportation options. Additionally, students can attend classes at their own pace, which allows them to take more time to review material or move ahead more quickly if they are struggling.

Another advantage of online and video conferencing classes is the ability to access a wider range of courses. Many schools may not offer certain courses in person, but they can be made available online or via video conferencing. This allows students to take classes that may not be available to them otherwise.

However, there are also several disadvantages to taking classes online or via video conferencing. One of the main disadvantages is the lack of interaction with classmates and teachers. In person classes allow for more opportunities for collaboration and discussion, which can be beneficial for students' learning. Additionally, students may feel isolated or disconnected from their classmates and teachers, which can make it more difficult to stay motivated.

Another disadvantage of online and video conferencing classes is the potential for technical difficulties. Students may experience issues with their internet connection or with the technology they are using to access the classes. This can be frustrating and can make it difficult for students to stay engaged in the course material.

In conclusion, taking classes online or via video conferencing has both advantages and disadvantages. While it provides flexibility and access to a wider range of courses, it can also lead to a lack of interaction with classmates and teachers and potential technical difficulties. Ultimately, the decision to take classes online or via video conferencing should be made based on an individual's specific needs and circumstances.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Completing four years of high school is often seen as the ideal educational path and is highly beneficial for students. While an extra year of schooling can seem intimidating, it results in a number of educational, personal, and professional advantages.

Those who complete the four year plan will find greater access to more rigorous coursework, enabling meaningful intellectual and personal growth. With access to a broader range of classes, students will be able to explore new interests while developing a deeper understanding of existing ones. Furthermore, extra categories of electives and enriched curricula are often available to those who take an additional year. This allows students to pursue meaningful extracurricular activities, participate in valuable internship and volunteer opportunities, or even attempt to fulfill early college credit requirements.

Though an extra year of school may mean a later start to college, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Students will be better equipped for college-level work, making them more likely to succeed in their academic pursuits. Additionally, having extra time to refine both their skills and interests can result in more competitive applications.

In contrast to the four year plan, opting for three years of high school does have its benefits. Most notably, students who graduate early may have the opportunity to enter college with a head start, allowing them to adjust quickly to college life and possibly graduate early.

Ultimately, the best course for each student is dependent on individual considerations and should be approached with due diligence. Taking the extra year of high school can have invaluable benefits, potentially providing immersive learning experiences to open doors for brighter futures.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important to learn from one's own mistakes. However, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can also be beneficial. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of both approaches and provide examples of people who have made their own decisions and learned from their experiences.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be beneficial because it can provide a fresh perspective and potentially save time and resources. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular subject, seeking guidance from a teacher or tutor can help them understand the material more effectively. Additionally, seeking guidance from experts can provide a sense of security and validation, as they may have more experience and knowledge in a particular area.

However, making one's own decisions can also be beneficial. When individuals make their own decisions, they are able to take ownership of their choices and learn from their mistakes. This can lead to personal growth and development. For example, a person who has made a mistake and learned from it may be more likely to make better decisions in the future. Additionally, making one's own decisions can lead to a greater sense of independence and self-confidence.

There are many stories of people who have made their own decisions and learned from their experiences. One such example is Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Jobs made many unconventional decisions throughout his life, such as dropping out of college and focusing on developing Apple. While these decisions were not always successful, they ultimately led to the creation of one of the most successful companies in the world.

Another example is Oprah Winfrey, who made many difficult decisions throughout her life, such as moving from Mississippi to California and pursuing a career in television. While these decisions were not always easy, they ultimately led to her becoming one of the most successful and influential people in the world.

It is important to learn from one's own mistakes because it can lead to personal growth and development. When individuals make mistakes, they are able to reflect on what went wrong and identify areas for improvement. This can lead to better decision-making in the future. Additionally, learning from one's mistakes can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and self-reflection.

Not growing up and making one's own decisions can have a negative impact on personal development. When individuals rely too heavily on",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Graduating early or in the normal four-year period has been a topic of discussion for many students. While some students believe that graduating early is the best option, others believe that graduating in the normal four-year period is better. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of graduating early compared to graduating in the normal four-year period, considering the academic and financial effects, as well as the challenge of taking extra classes to graduate early.

Graduating early has several benefits. Firstly, it allows students to start their careers sooner, which can lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries. Additionally, graduating early can save students money on tuition and other expenses associated with college. Finally, graduating early can provide students with a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can motivate them to continue their education or pursue other goals.

However, graduating early also has its drawbacks. One of the main challenges is the increased workload and stress that comes with taking extra classes. This can lead to burnout and decreased academic performance. Additionally, graduating early may not always be financially beneficial, as students may not have enough time to find a job or secure internships. Finally, graduating early may not always lead to better job opportunities or higher salaries, as employers may not value graduates who have not had enough time to gain practical experience.

On the other hand, graduating in the normal four-year period also has its benefits. Firstly, it allows students to take a more traditional path through college, which can provide a more structured and predictable experience. Additionally, graduating in the normal four-year period can provide students with more time to explore their interests and pursue extracurricular activities. Finally, graduating in the normal four-year period can provide students with a sense of community and belonging, as they will have gone through college with their peers.

However, graduating in the normal four-year period also has its drawbacks. One of the main challenges is the potential for increased debt due to tuition and other expenses associated with college. Additionally, graduating in the normal four-year period may not always lead to better job opportunities or higher salaries, as employers may view graduates who have not had enough time to gain practical experience.

Hey there,

For my career research project, I decided to look into the field of graphic design. I've always been interested in art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool way. Plus, I've seen some of the amazing things that graphic designers can create, like logos, posters, and websites, and I want to be able to do that too!

So, I started doing some research to see what skills and interests I have that align with this career. I found out that I'm pretty good at drawing and painting, and I'm also good at using computers and software to create digital art. I also like to think creatively and come up with new ideas, which is important for graphic design.

To learn more about the career, I talked to some people who are already in the field. They told me that graphic designers need to have a good eye for detail and a good sense of color and composition. They also need to be able to work well with clients and communicate their ideas effectively. I was surprised to learn that it's not just about being able to draw pretty pictures – it's also about being able to solve problems and come up with creative solutions.

Next, I made a list of the courses I can take to prepare for this career. I'm thinking of taking some art classes to improve my drawing and painting skills, as well as some computer classes to learn more about software and design principles. I'm also considering taking a course in graphic design specifically, to learn more about the industry and what's expected of graphic designers.

Overall, I think graphic design is a really cool career that combines my interests in art and technology. I'm excited to continue learning more about it and see where it takes me!

Why I Chose This Career:

I chose graphic design as my career because I'm interested in both art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool way. I also like the idea of being able to create something from scratch and see it come to life in a final product.

"Graduating from high school in three years has become a popular trend among students. While some students may see it as an opportunity to get ahead of their peers, others may view it as a challenge that could hinder their academic and personal growth. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and obstacles to graduating from high school in three years.

One of the main benefits of graduating from high school in three years is the opportunity to save time and money. By completing high school in three years instead of four, students can save a year of tuition and other expenses associated with college. Additionally, they can start working or attending college sooner, which can help them establish a career or further their education.

Another benefit of graduating from high school in three years is the opportunity to gain valuable work experience. Many students choose to take internships or part-time jobs during their high school years. By graduating early, they can have more time to pursue these opportunities and gain valuable work experience before moving on to the next stage of their career.

However, graduating from high school in three years also presents several obstacles. One of the main obstacles is the increased pressure and stress that comes with accelerated academics. Students who graduate in three years often have to take more advanced courses and complete more coursework in less time. This can be challenging and may require additional study time and effort.

Another obstacle to graduating from high school in three years is the potential for a less well-rounded education. By graduating early, students may not have the same opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities or pursue their interests outside of the classroom. This can lead to a less well-rounded education and may limit their future opportunities.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years has both benefits and obstacles. While it can save time and money and provide valuable work experience, it also presents increased pressure and stress and the potential for a less well-rounded education. Ultimately, whether or not graduating in three years is the right choice for a student depends on their individual circumstances and goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Okay, here's my essay:

Everyone has different personalities. Like, some people are really outgoing and talkative, and some people are more quiet and reserved. Some people are really competitive and like to win, and some people are more laid back and just want to have fun. It's like, everyone's got their own unique personality, and that's what makes the world interesting.

But sometimes, people can have a bad day. Like, maybe they had a fight with their best friend or they didn't do well on a test. And sometimes, people can be really grumpy or irritable because of it. It's like, they're just having a bad day, and they can't help it.

But here's the thing: people can change their first impressions. Like, if someone is being really grumpy or mean, you can try to be nice to them and make them feel better. Or, if someone is being really quiet and reserved, you can try to get to know them better and find out what's going on. It's like, people are more than just their first impressions, and you can help them change their mood or behavior.

For example, once in my class, there was this one kid who was always being really mean to everyone. He would make fun of people's clothes or their hair, and it was really hurtful. But then, one day, he had a bad day at home and he came to school looking really sad and lonely. So, I went up to him and asked him if he was okay, and he started crying. And after that, he wasn't mean to anyone anymore. It was like, he changed his first impression of himself, and he became a nicer person.

So, in conclusion, everyone has different personalities, and people can have bad days. But, people can also change their first impressions by being nice to them or getting to know them better.

Additionally, technology helps us get access to a wealth of information that might otherwise be difficult to obtain.

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks associated with technology. For example, it has been linked to an increase in mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Additionally, many of us spend a great deal of time on our devices, which leaves us with little time for other activities and relationships.

In conclusion, while technology brings many benefits to our lives, it is also important to be aware of the potential risks. We should be mindful of how much time we spend on our devices and remember to take time away from them to engage in meaningful activities.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Curfews are an important tool in helping teenagers develop responsibility and self-regulation. By setting a curfew for teens, parents can ensure their child's safety, help foster better relationships, and give them a healthy lifestyle. 

One of the primary benefits of implementing a curfew is that it increases safety. With a curfew in place, teens are discouraged from participating in risky activities such as taking part in criminal activities or driving with no license. Additionally, parents can be sure that their teens are in a safe place, and not in an environment where they are vulnerable to potential harm.

Another benefit of curfews for teenagers is that it can help build better relationships with their family. By enforcing a curfew, teens are given structure and their parents can be reassured that their children are safe. This can encourage communication and dialogue between families and help foster a strong bond between parents and their children. 

Overall, curfews can help provide teens with the structure and guidance they need to stay safe and healthy. It can help give parents peace of mind and keep teens away from risky behaviors and environments. By implementing a curfew, families can build better relationships and teenagers can gain a better understanding of responsibility.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Taking classes online has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it's no surprise that many students are considering this option when pursuing higher education. While there are certainly advantages to online learning, there are also some drawbacks that students should be aware of. In this essay, I will examine the pros and cons of taking classes online from the perspective of a student who wishes to pursue higher education.

One of the biggest advantages of taking classes online is the flexibility that it offers. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which is especially beneficial for those who have other commitments, such as jobs or families. This flexibility also allows students to attend classes from anywhere, which can be particularly convenient for those who live far from a traditional campus.

Another advantage of online learning is the ability to access a wider range of courses. Many universities and colleges offer a limited selection of courses on their campuses, but students can take virtually any course they want online. This means that students can pursue their interests and passions, even if those interests are not available on their local campus.

Despite these advantages, there are also some drawbacks to taking classes online. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and classmates. Online learning can be isolating, and students may miss out on the social connections and support that come with attending classes in person.

Another disadvantage of online learning is the potential for distractions. With online classes, students need to have a lot of self-discipline in order to complete their coursework. This can be difficult for some students, who may struggle to stay focused and motivated without the structure of a traditional classroom.

In conclusion, taking classes online has its pros and cons. While it offers flexibility and access to a wider range of courses, it can also be isolating and difficult to stay motivated without face-to-face interaction. Ultimately, the decision to take classes online should be based on the individual needs and preferences of the student. Students who value flexibility and convenience may find online learning to be the best option for them, while those who prefer a more traditional classroom experience may be better off attending classes on a traditional campus.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that schools should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. While it may seem like a good idea to let students graduate early and move on to the next stage of their lives, there are several reasons why this should not be allowed.

First and foremost, graduating a year early can have a negative impact on a student's academic performance. High school is a time of great change and development, and students need to be challenged and engaged in order to reach their full potential. If students are allowed to graduate early, they may not be given the same level of academic rigor and support as they would have received if they had stayed in school for another year.

Additionally, graduating early can lead to a lack of maturity and readiness for the next stage of life. High school is a time for students to learn important life skills and develop their sense of self. If students are rushed through this process, they may not have the same level of emotional and intellectual maturity as they would have had if they had stayed in school for another year.

Furthermore, graduating early can also lead to a lack of financial stability. Many students who graduate early may not have the same level of financial support as they would have had if they had stayed in school for another year. This can lead to financial difficulties and make it harder for them to achieve their goals.

In conclusion, while it may seem like a good idea to let high school kids graduate early, there are several reasons why this should not be allowed. Graduating early can have a negative impact on a student's academic performance, lead to a lack of maturity and readiness for the next stage of life, and lead to financial difficulties. Schools should prioritize the academic and personal development of their students and ensure that they are given the support and resources they need to succeed.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Ugh, I don't want to write another essay, but here goes nothing! 

So, the question is, should we have a longer winter break or not? And the answer is, definitely not! I mean, think about it, if we had a longer winter break, it would be like, forever!  And can you imagine all the snow storms we'd have to deal with? Like, seriously, it would be a nightmare! My mom is always complaining about how hard it is to drive in the snow, and I don't want to be stuck inside for like, two months! 

But, I know some people might be thinking, ""But, winter break is when we can relax and recharge!"" And yeah, I get that, but like, have you seen the news? The world is not exactly the most chill place right now. There's always something going on, and if we had a longer winter break, we'd just be missing out on even more important stuff! 

And don't even get me started on the summer break. I mean, sure, it's nice to have a longer break, but like, it's not like we need it. We already have a pretty long summer, and if we made it any longer, it would be like, hello, summer vacation never ends!  And let's be real, who wants to spend their whole summer stuck in the house? Not me, that's for sure!

So, what about the one-week break in the fall and spring? I don't know, it just seems like a lot of extra work for no real reason. I mean, we already have breaks in the winter and summer, so why do we need another one in the spring? It's not like we're going to get any extra time off or anything. 

In conclusion, having a longer winter break, a shorter summer break, and a one-week break in the fall and spring is not a good idea. It's just not worth it. We should stick to the regular summer, winter, and spring breaks we already have. They may not be the longest, but they're better than nothing! *",1,llama2_chat,3
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about first impressions and how they can affect our relationships with others. I mean, let's be real, first impressions are like, super important, right? They can make or break how people perceive us and how we perceive them.

Like, I remember this one time when I first met my BFF in middle school. I was like super nervous and didn't know what to say, so I just stood there awkwardly and fidgeted with my hair. And honestly, it took me like, forever to make a good impression on her. But once I finally opened up and started talking about my favorite things, like, she was totally cool and we've been besties ever since.

But on the other hand, I've also had some not-so-great first impressions. Like, there was this one kid in my class who was like, super arrogant and always bragging about how he was better than everyone else. And honestly, it was like, total turn-off. I didn't want to be around him or talk to him, and I definitely didn't want to be his friend.

So, from my experiences, I think it's safe to say that first impressions are like, super important. They can set the tone for how people perceive you and how you perceive them, and they can either make or break your relationships. And I think it's important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others, because like, you never know when you're going to meet someone who could be a really important person in your life.

But at the same time, I also think it's important to give people a chance and not judge them too quickly. Like, I've had friends who I didn't really click with at first, but once we got to know each other better, we became super close. So, I think it's important to keep an open mind and not write someone off just based on one impression.

Overall, I think first impressions are like, super important, but they're also not the only thing that matters. It's important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others, but also to give people a chance and not judge them too quickly",1,llama2_chat,1
"In 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously declared, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement, a rallying cry for determination in the face of difficulty, has been held as an essential tenet of success. The idea of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm has strong advantages - being resilient and passionate in the face of struggle can help an individual persist and ultimately achieve success. 

Conversely, going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm can be extremely detrimental. When faced with failure, a discouraged attitude can lead an individual to become apathetic, and even worse, to give up altogether. It is important to recognize the distinction between both approaches to success, and opt for the former whenever possible.

Throughout history, many figures have illustrated the power of Churchill's words. For example, inventor Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before discovering the first working incandescent lightbulb. His refusal to let failure stand in his way highlights the importance of sustaining enthusiasm and resilience in the pursuit of success. African American Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks showed similar determination when she took a stand against segregation on a Montgomery bus in 1955. 

In the face of failure and difficulty, it is paramount to draw motivation from the idea of perseverance and never giving up - Churchill's words embody this notion. The importance of maintaining a positive attitude despite challenges cannot be understated; it has the potential to take a person from failure to success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Working independently and in a group are two common ways of completing tasks. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and which one is better depends on the situation. In this essay, I will research and compare the advantages and disadvantages of working independently and in a group, considering the impact on learning, productivity, communication, and accuracy.

Working independently has its advantages, such as the ability to work at your own pace, focus on your own ideas, and take responsibility for your work. When working independently, you have more control over your work and can work in a way that suits your learning style. Additionally, you can work in a quiet and distraction-free environment, which can help you to be more productive.

However, working independently also has its disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that you may miss out on valuable feedback and support from others. When working in a group, you can get feedback from your peers and receive guidance from your teacher or mentor. This can help you to improve your work and learn from others. Additionally, working independently can be isolating, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from others.

On the other hand, working in a group has its advantages, such as the ability to learn from others, share ideas, and receive feedback. When working in a group, you can learn from your peers and receive guidance from your teacher or mentor. Additionally, working in a group can be more enjoyable, as you can collaborate with others and share ideas.

However, working in a group also has its disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that you may struggle to manage your own work and may be distracted by others. When working in a group, it can be difficult to focus on your own work and manage your own time effectively. Additionally, working in a group can be challenging if there are differences in opinions or work styles, which can lead to conflicts and disagreements.

In conclusion, both working independently and in a group have their advantages and disadvantages. Working independently can be beneficial for learning, productivity, and personal responsibility, but it can also be isolating and lack feedback. Working in a group can be beneficial for learning, collaboration, and enjoyment, but it can also be challenging to manage work and manage differences in opinions or work styles.

"Many students feel pressured to decide on a career by the time they enter high school, but this is not always a good idea. At this age, they typically lack the experience required to make a well-informed decision due to their age and the potential for carelessness. It is essential for students to take the time to explore what interests them, consider their skills and talents, and to try different activities to determine the career that best fits them. 

To make the best decision, students should create a plan, consisting of steps to help them evaluate their options. These steps could include talking with family, guidance counselors, and mentors; considering courses and activities that are related to the field of interest; researching potential job opportunities; and exploring education and specialized training opportunities. Through this process, students can gain valuable insight into their career options, make an informed decision, and ultimately achieve greater career success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student in response to the prompt:

The Effects of a Program on Student Relationships, Teamwork, and Trust

As an 8th grader, I have had the opportunity to participate in a program that has greatly impacted my relationships with my peers, teamwork, and trust in school. This program, which focuses on collaboration and communication, has taught me valuable lessons that I will carry with me throughout my academic journey.

One of the most significant effects of this program has been the improvement in my relationships with my peers. Before joining the program, I often found it difficult to work with others, as I preferred to work alone and didn't know how to effectively communicate with my peers. However, through the program, I have learned how to listen actively, express myself clearly, and work collaboratively with others. As a result, I have formed strong bonds with my peers, and we have become a cohesive team that is able to work together effectively.

Another way the program has impacted me is by improving my teamwork skills. Before joining the program, I was not very good at working in groups, as I often felt that my ideas were not being heard or respected. However, through the program, I have learned how to effectively communicate my ideas, listen to others, and work towards a common goal. As a result, I have become more confident in my ability to work in teams and have formed strong partnerships with my peers.

Finally, the program has also helped me to develop trust in my peers and in the school community. Before joining the program, I often felt that my peers were not reliable or trustworthy, as I had experienced instances where they had let me down in the past. However, through the program, I have learned how to trust my peers and work with them in a way that is respectful and collaborative. As a result, I have formed strong relationships with my peers and have developed a greater sense of trust in the school community.

"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that we have about someone or something when we first encounter it. They are formed quickly and often based on limited information, and can be difficult to change once they have been established. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why it is so difficult to change a first impression and provide examples to illustrate this.

One reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it is based on our past experiences and expectations. We often have preconceived notions about people and situations based on our past experiences, and these can influence our initial thoughts and feelings. For example, if we have had a negative experience with someone in the past, we may be more likely to have a negative first impression of them in the future. Similarly, if we have high expectations for a situation, we may be more likely to have a negative first impression if it doesn't meet those expectations.

Another reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it is often formed quickly and based on limited information. We may only have a few minutes or hours to form a first impression of someone, and we may not have had the opportunity to get to know them well. This can make it difficult to form a fair and accurate impression, as we may not have all the information we need to make a well-informed judgment. For example, if we meet someone in a professional setting, we may form a first impression based on their appearance and demeanor, but we may not have the opportunity to get to know them well and learn more about their character and personality.

A third reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it can be influenced by external factors. Our first impression of someone or something can be influenced by the environment in which we encounter it. For example, if we meet someone in a crowded and noisy environment, we may have a harder time forming a clear first impression of them. Similarly, if we encounter someone in a situation that is unfamiliar to us, we may have a harder time forming a first impression. For example, if we meet someone in a foreign country, we may have a harder time forming a first impression of them because we are in an unfamiliar environment.

In conclusion, it is difficult to change a first impression because it is based on our past experiences and expectations, formed quickly and based on limited information, and influenced by external factors. These",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that the current policy on cell phone use in school is unfair to both teachers and students. While the policy is in place to maintain a distraction-free learning environment, it is not effective in achieving this goal. In this essay, I will review the current policy and propose a change that would make it fair for both teachers and students.

The current policy on cell phone use in school prohibits students from using their phones during class. However, this policy is not applied consistently, and some students are allowed to use their phones while others are not. This inconsistency creates a double standard and creates an unfair environment for students who are not allowed to use their phones.

Furthermore, the policy is not effective in achieving its goal of maintaining a distraction-free learning environment. Students can still use their phones in other ways, such as texting or listening to music, which can be just as distracting as using their phones during class. Additionally, the policy does not take into account the fact that some students may need their phones for medical or emergency reasons.

To make the policy fair for both teachers and students, I propose a change that would allow students to use their phones during class, but with certain restrictions. For example, students could be required to turn off their phones during class and only use them during designated breaks. Additionally, students could be required to keep their phones in their backpacks or lockers during class to prevent distractions.

This proposal would be fair because it would allow students to use their phones during class, but with certain restrictions that would prevent distractions. It would also be consistent with the policy, as all students would be required to follow the same rules.

In conclusion, I believe that the current policy on cell phone use in school is unfair to both teachers and students. A change that would allow students to use their phones during class, but with certain restrictions, would be fair and effective in maintaining a distraction-free learning environment. I urge the school to consider this proposal and make the necessary changes to create a more fair and consistent learning environment for all students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Life can be challenging and the attitude we take towards it directly affects our experiences. Having a good attitude can make all the difference in a situation. It can help us to handle difficult circumstances with grace and show that life is not all doom and gloom.

A positive attitude can help us to look at the bright side of any circumstance and focus on what we have instead of what we don't have. It's easier to be optimistic when something is bad, rather than getting bogged down in negativity. It can help us to keep going in tough times and to remain resilient.

Having a good attitude allows us to enjoy life more and to make the most out of any situation. It encourages us to explore new opportunities and take risks. Furthermore, it can help us to build stronger relationships with ourselves as well as with others. When we have a positive outlook, it is easier to forgive and it can help reduce stress.

Ultimately, attitude serves as a resource for resilience in both life’s good times and its difficult moments. It is a tool that we can draw on to bring out our best. A good attitude can support us in achieving our goals, no matter how insurmountable they may seem.

"Introduction

Technology has come a long way since the invention of the radio. From the radio to the computers, the advancements in technology have revolutionized the way people live. The people who worked on these inventions were determined to make the world a better place, and their hard work paid off. In this essay, I will discuss the history of technology advancements, the people who made them possible, and how they have changed the way people live.

The Radio

The radio was the first major technological advancement in the 20th century. The radio was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1895. Marconi was a determined individual who refused to give up on his invention. He faced many challenges, including opposition from other inventors and the difficulty of transmitting signals over long distances. Despite these challenges, Marconi persevered and made significant improvements to the radio.

Farnsworth was a brilliant inventor who had a vision for the future of technology. He worked tirelessly to develop a television that could be broadcasted over long distances. Farnsworth's determination paid off, and the television became a popular household item in the 1950s.

The Computer

The computer was the most significant technological advancement in the 20th century. The first computer, the ENIAC, was invented in 1945. The ENIAC was a massive machine that was capable of performing complex calculations. The invention of the computer revolutionized the way people work and live. Today, computers are a vital part of our daily lives, and they have transformed the way we communicate, work, and learn.

The People Behind the Inventions

The people who worked on these inventions were determined to make the world a better place. Guglielmo Marconi, Philo Taylor Farnsworth, and John Mauchly were all brilliant inventors who refused to give up on their ideas. They faced many challenges, including opposition from other inventors and the difficulty of developing complex technologies.

"In today's fast-paced world, technology has become an integral part of our lives. One of the most popular devices that have become ubiquitous in our daily lives is the cell phone. While cell phones have become an essential tool for communication, they have also become a subject of debate when it comes to their use in the classroom for educational purposes. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of using cell phones in the classroom and express my opinion on the matter.

On the one hand, cell phones have the potential to enhance the learning experience in the classroom. One of the main advantages of using cell phones in the classroom is that they provide instant access to a vast amount of information. Students can use their cell phones to research topics, access educational apps, and even collaborate with their classmates. Additionally, cell phones can be used to create interactive and engaging lessons that incorporate multimedia elements such as videos and images.

However, there are also several disadvantages to using cell phones in the classroom. One of the main concerns is that cell phones can be a source of distraction for students. With the ability to access social media, play games, and send messages, students may be tempted to use their cell phones instead of focusing on their studies. Furthermore, cell phones can also be a source of cheating, as students can use their devices to access information or communicate with their classmates during exams.

In my opinion, the benefits of using cell phones in the classroom outweigh the drawbacks. While there is a risk of distraction and cheating, if used properly, cell phones can be a powerful tool for enhancing the learning experience. Teachers can use cell phones to create engaging lessons that incorporate multimedia elements and provide instant access to information. However, it is important for teachers to establish clear guidelines and expectations for the use of cell phones in the classroom to ensure that they are used appropriately and do not become a source of distraction.

In conclusion, the use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes is a topic that has both pros and cons. While there are concerns about distraction and cheating, if used properly, cell phones can be a powerful tool for enhancing the learning experience. Teachers must establish clear guidelines and expectations to ensure that cell phones are used appropriately and do not become a source of distraction.

Additionally, there are many other ways in which art can be monetized, such as freelancing, creative consulting, and licensing artwork. Furthermore, those who study art can gain a deep understanding and appreciation for creativity, which can then help them in other aspects of their life, such as running their own business, developing marketing concepts, or even building animation.

"In a world filled with expectations, it can be difficult to remain true to oneself. The struggles of being yourself can often be compounded for immigrant populations, teenagers, and those who are considered ‘different’. For example, immigrant families often have to deal with different cultures, expectations, and norms, which can make it hard for them to stay true to their identity and beliefs. Teenagers, in particular, frequently have to face peer pressure to conform to certain standards and ideals, which again can make it difficult to be their authentic selves. And those who are seen as ‘different’ – whether because of their personal preferences, physical appearance, or anything else – often have to battle against negative stereotypes in order to remain true to themselves.

Despite these difficulties, however, it is possible to be yourself, even in difficult situations. For example, it can be beneficial to surround oneself with people who can support, encourage and motivate you to be your true self, free from judgement. It can also be beneficial to identify and nurture your passions and engage in meaningful activities. Through these means, it is possible to stick to your values and be your true self in spite of any pressure to conform. 

Indeed, ‘being yourself’ in less than ideal conditions can be the ‘greatest accomplishment’ of all. By remaining true to your authentic self, you can stay confident and maintain your integrity, even when facing adversity. It is a difficult but ultimately rewarding feat, one which is worthy of celebration and acknowledgement.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American philosopher renowned for his writings on individualism and self-reliance.

This philosophy can be applied to mastering any skill or trying something new. It encourages us to take ownership of our own development, symbolically “take the helm” of our own lives, and stay the course of relentless self-improvement. In today’s world, Emerson’s philosophy is just as relevant as ever. In an era of 24/7 connectivity and distractions, it is harder than ever to stay focused and determined when trying something new or mastering a skill. Emerson’s idea of self-reliance provides foundation for anyone to stay steadfast and committed to their path and personal growth.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that we accomplish more when we are always doing something rather than when we are inactive. While it may seem counterintuitive, I believe that taking action and constantly striving for improvement is the key to success. In this essay, I will provide specific examples to support my position.

Firstly, I believe that taking action is crucial in achieving our goals. When we are always doing something, we are actively working towards our goals and making progress. For example, if we want to become proficient in a new language, we must actively practice speaking, writing, and listening. By constantly working on our language skills, we will eventually become fluent. Similarly, if we want to improve our grades, we must actively study and work on our assignments. By consistently working on our studies, we will be able to achieve higher grades.

Secondly, I believe that taking action also helps us to overcome obstacles and challenges. When we are faced with a challenge, we must take action and actively work towards finding a solution. For example, if we are struggling with a difficult math problem, we must actively work on understanding the concepts and finding a solution. By taking action, we will be able to overcome the challenge and move forward.

Finally, I believe that taking action also helps us to develop important skills such as perseverance and determination. When we are constantly striving for improvement, we must be willing to put in the effort and persevere through challenges. For example, if we want to become a successful athlete, we must be willing to practice every day and work hard towards our goals. By developing these skills, we will be able to achieve our goals and become successful in all areas of our lives.

In conclusion, I believe that we accomplish more when we are always doing something rather than when we are inactive. Taking action, actively working towards our goals, overcoming obstacles, and developing important skills such as perseverance and determination are all crucial to achieving success. By constantly striving for improvement, we will be able to achieve our goals and become successful in all areas of our lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that creating a rule that all high school students must take courses during the summer, evenings, or weekend in order to finish school faster would have significant implications on the education system, particularly on immigrant students, teachers, and other students. While it may seem like a good idea to increase the number of hours students spend in school, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and consequences of such a policy.

Firstly, requiring high school students to take courses during the summer, evenings, or weekend would have a significant impact on immigrant students. Many immigrant students come from different countries and may not have the same cultural background as their peers. They may face language barriers, cultural differences, and other challenges that make it difficult for them to keep up with their peers in school. By forcing them to take additional courses during the summer, evenings, or weekend, they may struggle to balance their academic and personal responsibilities. This could lead to increased stress and anxiety, which could negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

Secondly, requiring high school students to take additional courses could put a strain on teachers. Teachers already have a heavy workload, and adding more courses to their schedule could make it even more challenging for them to manage their workload effectively. This could lead to increased stress and burnout, which could negatively impact their ability to teach effectively and provide quality education to their students.

Thirdly, requiring high school students to take additional courses could also impact the time available for hobbies, travel, and other important aspects of life. High school students are at a crucial stage in their lives, and it is important for them to have time to pursue their interests and passions. By forcing them to take additional courses during the summer, evenings, or weekend, they may not have the time to engage in activities that are important to them. This could lead to a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in their lives, which could negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

In conclusion, while the idea of requiring high school students to take additional courses during the summer, evenings, or weekend may seem like a good idea, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and consequences of such a policy. It is important to ensure that all students, including immigrant students, have the time and resources they need to succeed academ",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Maintaining one's individual identity is essential to leading a successful life. People often conform to societal standards, but a commitment to one's own values and beliefs often leads to a greater personal satisfaction and success. Emerson's quote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" captures the importance of forging one's own path in order to lead an authentic life.

One example of this is the story of Wilma Rudolph. Orphaned at a young age, Rudolph encountered discrimination as an African American but went on to become a three-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field. Later, she became a teacher and mentor, inspiring others to remain true to themselves regardless of the obstacles.

By remaining true to her identity, Rudolph was able to make a lasting impact that transcended any societal boundaries that had been placed before her. This resonates with the Emerson quote; ultimately, staying true to one's own identity is what leads to the greatest success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"One of the potentially major advantages of finishing high school early is gaining exclusive monetary and educational opportunities that may be unavailable to students who take the traditional four-year timeframe. Finishing early can provide students with the opportunity to gain real-world experience and begin their college career earlier. Furthermore, some students may be able to start their high school or college studies at an accelerated pace, providing an edge on their competition. 

However, there are some risks associated with graduating early. Students may be missing out on important life experiences such as proms, summer activities, or networking with other students that can be beneficial afterwards. Furthermore, learning at an advanced pace may be difficult for students who are not incredibly motivated or lack the resources to do so. 

Overall, the four-year traditional high school experience provides a large range of benefits. It can provide a strong academic and social foundation, while also allowing students to focus on self-exploration and create memories that they will cherish for years to come. Ultimately, it is up to the student to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of finishing high school early and decide if it is the best option for their academic and personal goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Building self-esteem by accomplishing goals can have powerful and long-lasting effects. Achieving goals can give us a sense of accomplishment, a powerful boost to our confidence, and a feeling of increased pride in ourselves. For instance, if an individual sets a goal to finish a book and perseveres to the end of the project, they can feel a sense of accomplishment from having completed the task. Similarly, if a person pursues a goal to become healthier and meets that goal, they can be filled with an inner sense of pride, self-satisfaction, and enhanced self-worth. 

These feelings of increased self-esteem from goal achievement are different from the sense of self-worth that comes from praise. While praise from others can be encouraging and uplifting, it is more fleeting and does not necessarily fuel an inner motivation to work harder or strive for your goals. However, self-esteem from achieving goals leaves a lasting impression that can be accessed even when no outside praise is available.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Hey there!  So, you know how some people think that online classes are the way to go because you can learn from the comfort of your own home and stuff?  I'm here to tell you why I think attending a regular school is way better.

First of all, let's talk about the social aspect. When you're at home, you're missing out on all the fun stuff that happens in a regular school. Like, have you ever tried to have a deep conversation with your cat? It's just not the same as hanging out with your friends and classmates. You can learn so much from them, like how to be more empathetic or how to survive a water balloon fight.  And let's not forget about the extracurricular activities! You can join clubs and sports teams, which can help you discover your passions and make new friends.

Another thing that's super important is the face-to-face interaction with teachers. When you're online, it's easy to get distracted by your own thoughts or the internet in general.  But when you're in a classroom, you can ask questions and get immediate feedback. Plus, teachers can tell when you're not paying attention, so you better be on your A-game!  And let's not forget about the visual aids! When you're in a classroom, you can see the whiteboard and the videos that teachers show you. It's way easier to understand stuff when you can see it in person.

Now, I know some people might think that online classes are more convenient because you can learn at your own pace. But let's be real, sometimes you need a little push to stay on track.  When you're at home, it's easy to get distracted by your bed or your phone.  But when you're in a classroom, you have to stay focused because you don't want to fall behind. It's like having a personal trainer for your brain! 

Of course, there are some benefits to online classes too. Like, you can learn from anywhere and",1,llama2_chat,4
"Title: The Power of Positivity: Unlocking Success in Life

Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm excited to dive into the topic of having a positive attitude and its impact on success in life. Researching this topic has shown me that having a positive outlook can lead to amazing things! 😍

Let's start with some real-life examples. Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful women in media, credits her positive attitude for her achievements. She believes that ""your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude."" Similarly, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, says that ""a positive attitude can help you overcome any obstacle."" These examples show us that having a positive attitude can help us achieve our goals and reach new heights! 🚀

But how does having a positive attitude lead to success? Well, for starters, it helps us stay motivated and focused. When we have a positive outlook, we're more likely to take risks and push through challenges. It also helps us build stronger relationships with others, which can lead to new opportunities and growth. Plus, having a positive attitude can improve our mental and physical health, which is crucial for overall well-being. 🧘‍♀️🏋️‍♀️

Of course, keeping a positive attitude isn't always easy. There will be times when things don't go our way, and it's easy to get discouraged. But the key is to not let those setbacks define us. Instead, we need to learn from them and keep moving forward. One practical strategy is to practice gratitude. By focusing on the good things in our lives, we can shift our perspective and stay positive even in tough times. 🌞

Another strategy is to surround ourselves with positive people. When we're around people who support and encourage us, it's easier to maintain a positive attitude. And hey, who doesn't love a good motivational meme or quote? 😂

So, is a positive attitude really the key to success in life? Well, I think it's definitely a factor. But it",1,llama2_chat,4

So, you know how people keep telling us that high school is like a bridge to our future careers?  Like, I get it, but it's kinda hard to think about right now when I'm still trying to figure out who I am and where I belong.  But, I guess it's important to start thinking about it, you know? 

So, I did some research and found out that there are like, a million opportunities in high school to explore different careers.  Like, did you know you can take classes in coding, or photography, or even fashion design?!  I mean, I'm definitely interested in tech, so I might check out that coding thing.  But, I also really love art, so maybe I'll try out the photography class too. 

But, here's the thing: I don't just want to pick a career because it's ""cool"" or because I think I'll make a lot of money.  I want to find something that I'm actually passionate about and that makes me happy.  Like, I know this sounds cheesy, but I want to do something that brings me joy and fulfillment. 

So, to do that, I'm gonna start developing my skills and passions.  Like, I'm gonna take on more challenges and push myself to be better.  I'm gonna join clubs and organizations that align with my interests and passions.  And, I'm gonna talk to people in my desired field and ask them for advice. 

I mean, I know it's gonna take time and effort, but I'm willing to put in the work.  Because, at the end of the day, I want to be happy and fulfilled in my career.  And, I know that if I follow my passions and develop my skills, I can make that happen.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Thomas Jefferson was a man of many talents and accomplishments. He was a founding father of the United States, a writer, inventor, and philosopher. Throughout his life, Jefferson believed that hard work was the key to achieving success. He believed that success was not something that came easily or without effort. Instead, he believed that it took dedication, discipline, and perseverance to achieve great things.

Jefferson believed that hard work was necessary for success because he had experienced it firsthand. He had worked tirelessly on his own projects, such as the Declaration of Independence and his experiments with polygraphy. He had also seen the fruits of hard work in the success of others. He admired the dedication and perseverance of his fellow Americans who had worked hard to build a better country.

Jefferson also believed that hard work was necessary for success because he saw it as a way to overcome obstacles and challenges. He believed that success was not something that came without setbacks and failures. Instead, he saw it as a process of learning from mistakes and using that knowledge to improve in the future.

While Jefferson believed that hard work was necessary for success, he also recognized that technological advancements could both help and hinder progress. He saw the potential of technology to automate tasks and improve efficiency, but he also saw the danger of relying too heavily on technology. He believed that technology should be used as a tool to enhance human abilities, not replace them.

There are many examples of people who have found success by staying motivated and working hard. One such example is Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla. Musk has worked tirelessly on his projects, often working long hours and sacrificing personal time to achieve his goals. His hard work and dedication have paid off, as SpaceX and Tesla have both achieved great success.

Another example is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter book while working as a researcher and bilingual secretary. She spent long hours working on her manuscript, often writing in cafes and on trains. Her hard work and dedication paid off, as the Harry Potter series has become one of the most successful book series of all time.

"My school offers a unique distance learning program that allows students to study from the comfort of their own home. It provides flexible learning opportunities for many students who can't access traditional schools, such as those who have medical conditions, live far away from the school, or have other commitments that prevent them from attending classes in person. 

Distance learning involves online classes and video conferencing, both of which offer their own advantages and disadvantages compared to attending classes in person. For instance, online classes can be easy to access at any time of day and from any location, but they can also lack the active learning environment of a traditional classroom setting. Video conferencing can improve access to a more engaging learning environment compared to online classes, but its success often depends on having the right online tools and reliable internet connections. 

I once took an online class through the distance learning program while also attending classes in person. The online course allowed me to work through the material at my own pace, and it provided me ample opportunities to connect with other students in real-time to ask questions and get feedback. This flexibility facilitated and challenged my learning more than if I just attended classes in person. 

Overall, I believe the distance learning program offered by my school is a great opportunity for students to supplement their education while balancing other commitments. It supports a learning environment that is more personalized and independent, yet still connected to the resources and people of a school setting.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As an 8th-grade student, I have always dreamed of visiting Generic_City. It is a city that I have always been fascinated by, and I am eager to explore all of the amazing places it has to offer. In this essay, I will discuss the places to visit in Generic_City, the various museums, the Cherry Blossom, and create an itinerary for my trip.

Generic_City is home to some of the most iconic landmarks in the United States, including the White House and the Abraham Lincoln Monument. These two landmarks are a must-see for any visitor to the city. The White House is a symbol of the United States government and is a testament to the country's history. The Abraham Lincoln Monument is a tribute to one of the greatest presidents in American history and is a reminder of the sacrifices made for the country.

In addition to these iconic landmarks, Generic_City is also home to several museums that are worth exploring. The Air and Space Museum is a must-visit for anyone interested in space exploration. The museum features interactive exhibits, full-scale aircraft, and spacecraft, and is a great way to learn about the history of space exploration. The Art Museum is another great place to visit, as it features a vast collection of art from around the world.

One of the most famous attractions in Generic_City is the Cherry Blossom. The Cherry Blossom is a beautiful park located in the heart of the city and is a must-see for anyone visiting during the spring. The park is filled with cherry trees, which bloom in the spring and create a stunning display of pink flowers. The park is a great place to take a walk, have a picnic, or simply enjoy the beauty of nature.

"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research the positive and negative impacts of cell phones in the classroom.  Let me tell you, it's a pretty controversial topic. 

First of all, let's talk about the positive impacts.  Cell phones can be really helpful in the classroom!  Like, you can use them to look up information for projects or to access educational apps that can make learning more fun and interactive.  My teacher even uses them to poll us during lectures, which helps us stay engaged.  It's like, ""Hey, what do you guys think about this?"" and we can just raise our phones and vote. 

But,  there are also some negative impacts.  Like, sometimes students get distracted during class and start playing games or scrolling through social media.  It's like, ""Ugh, why are you on your phone when you're supposed to be learning?""  And sometimes, teachers can get frustrated with students who are on their phones too much.  It's like, ""Put your phone away and pay attention!"" 

So,  compared to the positive impacts, the negative impacts are definitely more obvious.  But,  I think it's important to find a balance.  Like, maybe we can use our phones for educational purposes, but also make sure we're not getting distracted.  It's like, ""Hey, let's use our phones to learn, but also let's not get too caught up in them.""

"Praising students is an important part of building self-esteem. Self-esteem is a child's belief in their ability to succeed and meet goals. It helps to ensure that they face challenges with a positive attitude. Praise can create a positive environment and teach children that it is alright to take risks and challenge themselves, even if there may be some failures along the way.

When praising students, it is important to be specific. Rather than general statements like ‘good job’, focus on the process a child utilized to get good results. For example, praise them for their hard work and determination to practice and master a skill. Praising effort rather than results can make children feel confident in trying out new tasks without worrying about the outcome.

Another important thing to remember when praising students is to be genuine. Children can detect when someone is insincere, and when they do it can have the opposite effect on their self-esteem. Genuine praise will create more positive reactions in children and will motivate them to keep trying and doing their best.

Overall, praising students is an essential tool for helping to build self-esteem. It helps children to understand that trying and failing is a part of life, and that success may not come immediately but with effort and determination it can be achieved.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Thomas Jefferson was a man of many ideas and accomplishments. He was a founding father of the United States, a writer, and an inventor. Jefferson believed that in order to achieve success, it was important to always be doing something and taking time to rest. In this essay, I will explore why Jefferson advocated for this approach and how rest can give you a chance to refresh your memories and perfect ideas. I will also analyze different perspectives on why it is important to find a balance between staying busy and taking time to rest.

Jefferson believed that in order to achieve success, it was important to always be doing something. He believed that the key to success was to constantly be working on new ideas and projects. He believed that taking time to rest would only hinder progress and prevent him from achieving his goals. However, Jefferson also recognized the importance of rest. He believed that taking time to rest was necessary in order to refresh your memories and perfect your ideas.

Jefferson believed that taking time to rest was important because it allowed him to clear his mind and focus on the task at hand. When he took a break, he was able to come back to his work with a fresh perspective and new ideas. He also believed that taking time to rest was important because it allowed him to reflect on his work and make improvements. When he took a break, he was able to see things from a different perspective and make changes that he may not have noticed before.

Overthinking small matters can be indicative of not taking the time to rest. When we overthink small matters, we can become overwhelmed and lose focus on the bigger picture. This can lead to wasted time and energy. Taking time to rest can help us to clear our minds and focus on the bigger picture. When we take a break, we can come back to our work with a fresh perspective and a clear understanding of what needs to be done.

Different people have different perspectives on why it is important to find a balance between staying busy and taking time to rest. Some people believe that taking time to rest is essential for mental health. They believe that taking time to rest can help to reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Others believe that taking time to rest is important for productivity. They believe that taking time to rest can help to improve focus and concentration, leading to increased productivity.

By understanding the influence of both internal and external factors, we can gain insight into our character and better understand our individual strengths and weaknesses.

"As an 8th grader, I have had the opportunity to take both online and traditional classes. While online classes offer many benefits, such as flexibility and convenience, they also have their fair share of disadvantages. In this essay, I will analyze the disadvantages of taking online classes, compare the consequences of not taking notes to not paying attention in an online class, and examine why online classes are not beneficial for students.

Firstly, online classes can be isolating for students. Without the face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates, it can be challenging to form connections and ask for help when needed. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in the course material. Additionally, online classes require a level of self-discipline and responsibility that can be difficult for some students to maintain. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their assignments and deadlines.

Secondly, not taking notes in an online class can have the same consequences as not paying attention in a traditional class. Without notes, students may struggle to recall important information later on, leading to a lack of understanding and difficulty completing assignments. Furthermore, online classes often require students to actively engage with the course material, such as through discussion forums and quizzes. Without notes, students may struggle to participate in these activities effectively.

Finally, online classes may not be beneficial for students because they may not provide the same level of hands-on experience as traditional classes. Many courses require students to conduct experiments or complete projects that cannot be done online. Without these experiences, students may not develop the same level of practical knowledge and skills that they would in a traditional classroom.

In conclusion, while online classes offer many benefits, they also have their disadvantages. Isolation, lack of motivation, and difficulty in completing assignments are just a few of the drawbacks of taking online classes. Furthermore, not taking notes in an online class can have the same consequences as not paying attention in a traditional class, and online classes may not provide the same level of hands-on experience as traditional classes. Ultimately, students should weigh the pros and cons of online classes before deciding whether they are the right fit for their learning style and needs.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey there, fellow students! 👋

I know we're all super busy with our school work and extracurricular activities, but I want to talk to you today about something that's really important to me: community service. 🌎

You know, I've been thinking a lot lately about how we can make our school and our community a better place. And I realized that we have the power to make a difference! 💪

One thing we can do is help clean up our school and its surroundings. Think about it, we spend most of our time here, so it's important that it's a place we can be proud of. Plus, it's not just about keeping our school looking good, it's also about being responsible members of our community. 🌟

Another thing we can do is assist our fellow students with their homework. I know it can be tough sometimes, and it's always nice to have someone to help you out. Plus, it's a great way to make new friends and be a good friend to others. 🤝

And finally, let's talk to our parents about the importance of community service. They might not always understand why it's so important, but if we explain it to them in a way that makes sense to us, they might start to see things differently. 📚

So, let's make a pact to do some community service together! It can be as simple as picking up trash around the school or as big as organizing a community event. Whatever we choose to do, I know it will make a difference and it will be fun! 🎉

"Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. When we approach situations with a positive attitude, our minds become open and creative, allowing us to see all of the potential opportunities that await us. Not only does having a positive attitude enable us to see these opportunities, but it also gives us the motivation and confidence to take advantage of them.

To illustrate this, consider the example of applying for a job. When we have an optimistic attitude about the process, we feel more positive about the interview and our chances of landing the role. We appear more professional and confident to the interviewer, thereby increasing our chances of success. On the other hand, if we take on a pessimistic attitude and focus on scenarios where we may fail, we become more apprehensive and inhibited about the whole process, killing our chances of success even before we’ve started. Likewise, when studying for an exam, having a positive attitude enables us to stay focused on the task and to believe in our ability to remember the material.

The power of having a positive attitude goes beyond just making us feel better in the short-term. When we have a positive outlook, our brains become more oriented towards problem-solving, creative solutions, and success. In essence, a positive attitude is a differentiator for success in life. It is, therefore, vital for us to maintain an optimistic and motivated outlook if we want to make the most out of our life endeavors.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"When it comes to working in a group versus working alone, there are both advantages and disadvantages to consider. Working in a group can provide a great opportunity for collaboration, as multiple individuals come together to brainstorm ideas, openly discuss different options, and share their unique perspectives. This makes it possible to generate more creative and innovative solutions to tackle challenging projects. Additionally, working in a group can reduce stress for the members as it ensures everyone has accountability and support from one another along the way. 

On the other hand, working alone also has its perks. It allows for uninterrupted concentration, uninterrupted focus, and no distractions from direct collaboration with other people. This is important for those moments when deep and vigorous contemplation is needed to solve complex or unique problems. Furthermore, it gives the individual the flexibility and autonomy to prioritize tasks and manage their own pacing. 

Ultimately, whether you decide to work in a group or alone depends on the task at hand and the individual's preferences. Both methods can benefit productivity and high-quality results if they are approached and executed effectively.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"The three-year high school program has been gaining popularity in recent years, and it's important to analyze the effects it has on students' education and future planning. While some argue that this program provides students with more opportunities to take elective courses and prepare for college, others argue that it can lead to rushing final year courses and a lack of depth in learning. In this essay, I will present a persuasive argument on whether or not students should be given the opportunity to graduate high school in three years.

Firstly, the three-year high school program allows students to take a wider range of elective courses. By taking more electives, students can explore their interests and talents, and potentially discover new areas of study that they may not have considered before. This can lead to a more well-rounded education, as students are exposed to different subjects and perspectives. Additionally, taking more electives can help students stand out to colleges and employers, as it shows that they are proactive and self-motivated in their learning.

However, the drawback of the three-year high school program is that it can lead to rushing final year courses. With only three years to complete high school, students may feel pressure to complete their required courses as quickly as possible, which can lead to a lack of depth in learning. This can be particularly problematic in subjects like math and science, where a strong foundation is essential for success in college and beyond. Additionally, rushing through final year courses can lead to a lack of critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are important for success in any field.

In conclusion, while the three-year high school program provides students with more opportunities to take elective courses, it can also lead to rushing final year courses and a lack of depth in learning. As such, it's important for schools and policymakers to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of this program before implementing it. Ultimately, students should be given the opportunity to graduate high school in three years if they choose to do so, but it should be accompanied by adequate support and resources to ensure that they are able to succeed academically and personally.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Working at a local bakery has always appealed to me, and I believe that I am suited for the role on so many levels. Firstly, I have always loved experimenting with ingredients and recipes – something I think could be perfect for a bakery setting. This love of experimenting means that I am very open to learning new things and have a real enthusiasm for different flavours, styles, and methods.

I also think I would relish the opportunity to make new friends in the local community by working at a local bakery. Bakers and customers alike are an important part of any bakery, and I think it would be great to forge relationships with regulars and simply talk shop with like-minded bakers.

Finally, I believe I have the energy and enthusiasm required to successfully showcase this local bakery to potential employers. From working tirelessly to craft the perfect product, to thinking proactively about marketing strategies, I have confidence in my ability to take the bakery to a new level of success.

In conclusion, I am drawn to the idea of working in a local bakery and am confident I could integrate quickly into the role and make a positive impact.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"When considering whether to add one and a half more hours to the school day, several important factors must be taken into account. Firstly, providing an extended school day would take away from time students otherwise would spend on after-school activities, such as club meetings or sports practices. For instance, a student who is on the school's football team would have to decide between sacrificing time spent developing their team skills or risk sacrificing their academic pursuits. 

Secondly, this extra hour and a half would also put a strain on our already stretched teachers and staff. As the school day length increases, so do the workloads for teachers, making it harder for them to focus on their students. Additionally, due to the lack of time for other pursuits such as research, the pay might become too poor to attract new teachers and staff.

Finally, this longer school day would leave students tired and unable to learn as effectively as they would when properly rested. During an extended school day, students would be less alert and less likely to absorb what they are taught, reducing the quality of their education. 

These are just a few of the reasons why the school should not add one and a half more hours to the school day. It is important to take student's health, well-being, and education into account when determining what is best for the school. Therefore, I strongly urge the school against extending the school day.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Extracurricular activities have been a part of the educational experience for many years. They are designed to provide students with opportunities to engage in activities outside of the classroom that can help them develop new skills, socialize with peers, and improve their overall well-being. In this essay, we will explore the effects of extracurricular activities on students' stress levels, grades, and family relationships.

First, let's look at the impact of extracurricular activities on stress levels. Research has shown that participation in extracurricular activities can help reduce stress levels in students. Engaging in activities that require physical or mental effort, such as sports or clubs, can help students relieve tension and improve their mood. Additionally, extracurricular activities can provide a sense of community and belonging, which can also help reduce stress levels.

Moving on to grades, studies have found that participation in extracurricular activities can have a positive impact on academic performance. Extracurricular activities can provide students with opportunities to develop new skills, such as leadership, teamwork, and time management, which can translate into better grades in the classroom. Additionally, extracurricular activities can help students stay motivated and focused on their academic goals, which can lead to higher grades.

Finally, let's consider the impact of extracurricular activities on family relationships. Participation in extracurricular activities can provide students with opportunities to connect with their families in new and meaningful ways. For example, families can attend extracurricular events together, such as sports games or music performances, which can strengthen their bond. Additionally, extracurricular activities can provide students with a sense of independence and autonomy, which can help them develop healthy relationships with their families.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities can have a positive impact on students' stress levels, grades, and family relationships. They provide students with opportunities to develop new skills, socialize with peers, and improve their overall well-being. While there may be some challenges associated with balancing extracurricular activities with other responsibilities, the benefits of participation far outweigh the costs. Encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them lead healthier, more fulfilling lives both inside and outside of the classroom.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

"In his famous essay ""Self-Reliance,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson stated, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as it highlights the importance of constantly challenging oneself and stepping out of one's comfort zone in order to achieve personal growth and development.

The journey of learning something new is a crucial part of personal growth. It pushes us to think critically and creatively, and forces us to confront our own limitations. When we try to do something beyond what we have already mastered, we are forced to learn new skills and techniques, which can be challenging and uncomfortable at first. However, as we continue to practice and push ourselves, we become stronger and more capable.

One of the most rewarding aspects of learning something new is the final result of mastering it. When we have achieved mastery, we feel a sense of pride and accomplishment that is unmatched by simply completing a task. We have proven to ourselves that we are capable of achieving great things, and this confidence can carry over into other areas of our lives.

Furthermore, mastering something new can also lead to new opportunities and experiences. Whether it's a new hobby, a new job, or a new level of proficiency in a particular skill, there are always new challenges and adventures waiting for us. By constantly challenging ourselves and pushing ourselves to learn new things, we are opening ourselves up to a world of possibilities and growth.

In conclusion, I strongly agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The journey of learning something new is a crucial part of personal growth, and the final result of mastering it can be incredibly rewarding. By constantly challenging ourselves and pushing ourselves to learn new things, we are opening ourselves up to a world of possibilities and growth.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"It is widely accepted that having a positive attitude helps individuals to achieve success. It enables us overcome any obstacles that may stand in our path and push us to our full potential; however, success is not exclusively dependent on having a positive attitude. Even with a positive outlook, success is not always guaranteed. It is important to allow ourselves to feel negative emotions and understand that the fullest potential of success cannot be reached without recognizing our insecurities, doubts, and fears. 

One beneficial strategy to maintain positivity when surrounded by negativity is to take a break and focus on something else that brings us pleasure. Finding simple activities that can be enjoyed in our own time can help to temporarily take our minds away from our worries and stressors. Furthermore, having a positive attitude can help us discover our passions and achieve our personal objectives, as we recognize the opportunities and meaningful objectives that each day has to offer. Finally, being surrounded with positive influences and supportive friends and family can help to reinforce our positive outlook and provide us with the optimism and belief of achieving success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Making decisions can be a daunting task, but having the ability to consider multiple options is an important part of the process. Having the ability to weigh all of the options available to you enables you to make the best decision possible for your given situation. Seeking multiple options when making a decision provides a person with the ability to compare and contrast various solutions. Additionally, looking at different paths to reach the same outcomes can also insight new perspectives and ideas.

When considering multiple options, the decision maker is able to collaborate with others to receive additional insights, giving a more well rounded idea of potential solutions. Seeking the input of others who have expertise in the matter can be beneficial in understanding the implications of making the wrong decision and recipe solutions.

Making a decision can be difficult, but finding multiple options can help provide clarity and perspective on the best possible outcomes. Take the time to get all the information and resources necessary to make an informed decision. Having the ability to consider multiple possibilities will only be beneficial when making a decision. With the right plan of action, making informed decisions is achievable.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Working in groups versus working alone is a topic that has been debated among students, teachers, and parents. While some students may prefer to work alone, most students prefer working in groups. This essay will explore different viewpoints on why most students prefer working in groups rather than alone, analyze the benefits and drawbacks of working in groups, consider how forming a group for a project can be beneficial to its completion, examine the advantages of having a friend or group to help gather materials and data, and compare and contrast working in groups to working alone.

One reason why most students prefer working in groups is that it provides a sense of community and belonging. When working in a group, students can share ideas, collaborate on tasks, and support each other. This sense of community can be especially beneficial for students who may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers. Additionally, working in groups can provide opportunities for students to learn from their peers and develop important social skills, such as communication and teamwork.

However, there are also drawbacks to working in groups. One major drawback is that group work can be less efficient than working alone. When working in a group, students may have to compromise on their ideas or work at a slower pace to accommodate the needs of their group members. Additionally, group work can be more difficult to manage, especially if group members have different work styles or levels of commitment.

Despite these drawbacks, working in groups can be beneficial to the completion of a project. When working in a group, students can divide tasks and responsibilities, which can help to ensure that the project is completed on time. Additionally, group work can provide opportunities for students to learn from their peers and develop important skills, such as leadership and problem-solving.

Having a friend or group to help gather materials and data can also be beneficial. When working alone, students may struggle to gather all the necessary materials or data for a project. However, when working with a friend or group, students can pool their resources and work together to gather the necessary materials and data. Additionally, having a friend or group to provide input can help to ensure that the project is well-rounded and addresses all relevant issues.

In contrast, working alone can provide students with more control over their work and the ability to work at their own pace. When working alone, students can focus on their own ideas and work in a way that is best suited to",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"The school day is a crucial part of a student's academic journey. However, the current length of the school day may not be enough to provide students with the necessary time to learn and grow. In this essay, we will explore the benefits and drawbacks of extending the school day by one and a half hours for students. We will also examine possible activities that students can do within this time frame, and review potential issues that may arise with such an adjustment.

One of the main benefits of extending the school day is the increased amount of time students have to learn and engage in academic activities. With an additional hour and a half, students can have more time to focus on their studies, complete homework assignments, and work on projects. This extra time can also be used to provide students with additional enrichment activities, such as art, music, and physical education. These activities can help students develop their interests and talents, and provide them with a well-rounded education.

Another potential benefit of extending the school day is the impact it can have on a student's academic performance. Studies have shown that students who have more time to learn and engage in academic activities tend to perform better academically. This is because they have more time to absorb and process information, and to practice their skills. Additionally, an extended school day can provide students with more time to receive individualized attention from their teachers, which can also have a positive impact on their academic performance.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to extending the school day. One of the main concerns is the potential impact on a student's nutritional health. With an additional hour and a half in school, students may not have enough time to eat a healthy meal before or after school. This can lead to issues such as hunger, fatigue, and decreased concentration. Additionally, an extended school day can put additional pressure on students and their families, as they may need to make adjustments to their schedules to accommodate the longer school day.

In terms of possible activities that students can do within an extended school day, there are many options. These can include academic activities such as studying, completing homework assignments, and working on projects. However, there are also many enrichment activities that can be incorporated into the school day, such as art, music, and physical education. These activities can help students develop their interests and talents, and provide them with a well-round",1,llammistral7binstruct,1

"Making the right decision in life is crucial. It can have a significant impact on a person's personal life, family, and future. The consequences of wrong decisions can be severe and long-lasting. On the other hand, making good choices can lead to positive outcomes and a more fulfilling life.

One of the most significant consequences of wrong decisions is the impact on personal relationships. When a person makes a decision that hurts someone they care about, it can lead to a breakdown in communication and trust. For example, if a person cheats on their partner, it can lead to a divorce and the loss of a close relationship. Similarly, if a person lies to their friends or family, it can damage their reputation and relationships.

Furthermore, wrong decisions can also have a significant impact on a person's future. For example, if a person decides to drop out of school, they may miss out on opportunities for higher education and career advancement. Similarly, if a person makes a decision that leads to legal consequences, it can impact their future job prospects and financial stability.

On the other hand, making good choices can lead to positive outcomes and a more fulfilling life. When a person makes a decision that benefits themselves and others, it can lead to stronger relationships and a sense of accomplishment. For example, if a person decides to pursue their passions and work hard to achieve their goals, it can lead to a more fulfilling career and financial stability. Similarly, if a person makes a decision to help others, it can lead to a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

In conclusion, making the right decision in life is crucial. It can have a significant impact on a person's personal life, family, and future. The consequences of wrong decisions can be severe and long-lasting, while the benefits of making good choices can lead to positive outcomes and a more fulfilling life. It is essential to carefully consider the potential consequences of a decision before making it, and to always strive to make the best choice possible.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Title: The Wisdom of Elders: Why Listening to Generic_Name and Grandma Can Benefit Us All

As an 8th grader, I believe that listening to elders for advice and wisdom is incredibly important. I mean, think about it, they've been around for way longer than we have, and they've seen and experienced things that we can only dream of. So, it only makes sense that they have valuable insights and advice to share. In this essay, I'll be discussing the benefits of listening to elders, using the examples of Generic_Name and Grandma.

First of all, let's talk about Generic_Name. This person is someone who is always sharing their wisdom and experiences with others. They've been around for a while, and they've seen a lot of things in their time. They've been through ups and downs, and they know what it takes to overcome challenges. Whenever I talk to Generic_Name, I always leave feeling more informed and inspired. They have a way of making complex things seem simple, and they always offer practical advice that I can apply to my own life. For example, they once told me to never be afraid to take risks, because that's how we grow and learn. It's advice that I still think about to this day.

Now, let's talk about Grandma. Grandma is another elder who I have a lot of respect for. She's been around for a long time, and she's seen a lot of changes in her life. She's always willing to share her stories and experiences with me, and she has a lot of valuable insights to offer. One thing that Grandma always tells me is to appreciate the little things in life. She says that life is short, and we should enjoy every moment, no matter how big or small. She's right, of course. When we take the time to appreciate the little things, we can find joy in even the most mundane moments. And that's something that I try to do every day.

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important to influence others. Influencing others can be done in many ways, such as guiding, sharing thoughts, and sharing knowledge. In this essay, I will provide three reasons why it is important to influence others.

Firstly, guiding others can help them make better decisions. When we guide others, we provide them with direction and help them navigate through difficult situations. For example, if a friend is struggling with a problem at school, we can guide them towards resources or strategies that can help them solve the problem. By providing guidance, we can help our friends make informed decisions that can positively impact their lives.

Secondly, sharing thoughts can help others develop their own ideas and perspectives. When we share our thoughts with others, we open up a dialogue that can lead to new insights and ideas. This can be especially important in group settings, where different perspectives can be combined to create innovative solutions. By sharing our thoughts, we can help others develop their own ideas and perspectives, which can lead to more well-rounded and informed decision-making.

Thirdly, sharing knowledge can help shape the future of others and their children. When we share our knowledge with others, we can help them learn and grow. This can be especially important for young people, who are just beginning to develop their own ideas and perspectives. By sharing our knowledge with others, we can help shape the future of our communities and the world.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to influence others. Guiding, sharing thoughts, and sharing knowledge can all help others make better decisions, develop their own ideas and perspectives, and shape the future of their communities and the world. As an eighth-grade student, I am committed to using my influence to make a positive impact on the world around me.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0

"Ummm, hey there!  So, like, community service is totes important for keeping our city clean and safe, you know? 

First of all, let's talk about why community service is even a thing.  Like, it's not just something our teachers make us do because they're mean (although, let's be real, some of them can be pretty strict). No, community service is actually a way for us to give back to our community and make it a better place for everyone. 

For example, have you ever seen the trash and litter on the streets?  It's gross, right?! But when we do community service, we can help clean up the streets and make sure our city looks nice and tidy.  And not only that, but it also helps keep our city safe! 

Like, think about it. When there's less trash on the streets, it's less likely for animals to get hurt or for people to get sick from touching gross things.  And when our city looks nice, it makes us feel good too!  It's like, we're taking care of our home and making sure it's a place where we all want to be. 

Plus, when we do community service, we're also showing other people that we care about our community and that we're willing to work together to make it better.  It's like, we're all in this together, you know?  And when we work together, we can accomplish so much more than we could on our own. 

So, in conclusion, community service is super important for keeping our city clean and safe.  It's not just something we have to do, it's something we should want to do!  And who knows, maybe one day we'll be the ones organizing community service events and making our city an even better place!  Thanks for reading, I guess!",1,llama2_chat,4
"Pakistan is a beautiful country that offers a lot to visitors. One of the biggest advantages of visiting Pakistan is its proximity to parks. There are many parks in Pakistan that offer a wide range of activities, including hiking, biking, and picnicking.

"Partnerships between schools and local businesses can be incredibly beneficial for both parties involved. By working together, schools can provide students with real-world learning experiences and valuable skills, while businesses can gain access to a talented pool of young minds and potential future employees. However, there are also risks and challenges that come with forming these partnerships.

One of the biggest benefits of school-business partnerships is the opportunity for students to gain practical experience in their chosen fields. For example, a local engineering firm might partner with a high school to provide students with internships or mentorship opportunities, giving them hands-on experience in the industry. This can help students develop valuable skills and make informed decisions about their future careers. Additionally, partnerships can provide students with exposure to different career paths and industries, helping them to identify their strengths and interests.

Another benefit of school-business partnerships is the potential for increased student success. By working with local businesses, schools can provide students with access to resources and support that can help them succeed academically and professionally. For example, a business might provide financial support for a school's STEM program, or offer internships to students who are struggling academically. This can help to increase student motivation and engagement, leading to better academic performance and higher graduation rates.

However, there are also risks and challenges associated with school-business partnerships. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for conflicts of interest. For example, if a business is providing financial support to a school, there may be pressure on the school to prioritize the business's interests over those of the students. Additionally, there may be concerns about the quality of the partnership, as businesses may not always have the best interests of students in mind.

Another challenge is the potential for unequal power dynamics. In some cases, businesses may have more influence over the partnership than the school, leading to an unequal distribution of power. This can be especially problematic if the business is not transparent about its goals and intentions, leading to a lack of trust and accountability.

Despite these challenges, I believe that school-business partnerships can be incredibly beneficial for both parties involved. By carefully selecting partners and establishing clear guidelines and expectations",1,llama2_chat,1
"Hey there!  So, I know some people might think online classes are a waste of time, but let me tell you, they're not!  I mean, think about it, some students have difficulty coming to school, whether it's because of health issues or work commitments. Online classes are like, the perfect solution for them! 

First of all, online classes allow students to take their courses in the evening, which means they can do their schoolwork without having to miss out on important family time or work shifts. Like, my mom works late hours, so if I had to go to school during the day, I wouldn't be able to see her at all. But with online classes, I can do my schoolwork after she gets home, and we can still spend time together. It's like, the best of both worlds! 

And it's not just about family commitments, some students have to work to support themselves or their families. Online classes give them the flexibility to take their courses without having to sacrifice their jobs. They can do their schoolwork on their own time, like during their lunch break or after work. It's like, a win-win situation! 

But, some people might say that online classes are a waste of time because students don't get the same experience as they would in a traditional classroom.  Like, come on! Online classes have their own set of benefits! Students can learn at their own pace, which means they can take their time to understand the material and ask questions without feeling rushed. Plus, they can rewatch lectures or review material as many times as they want. It's like, the ultimate study tool! 

And, let's be real, traditional classes can be super boring sometimes.  Like, I know I'm not the only one who's fallen asleep in class before. Online classes are like, the perfect way to stay engaged and motivated. Students can take breaks whenever they need to, and they can even learn in different environments, like at home or in a coffee shop. It's like, a breath of fresh air!",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey there!  So, I was reading about Thomas Jefferson the other day, and I came across this thing he said about always doing something and taking time to rest. At first, I was like, ""Wait, didn't he know that taking breaks is important too?"" But then I realized, he totally knew what he was talking about! 

So, Jefferson believed that doing something all the time can help you get things done, but it's also important to take breaks and rest. Like, think about it, if you're constantly working on a project without taking a break, you might start to feel burnt out and your brain might not be able to think as clearly.  And who wants that? Not me, that's for sure!

But here's the thing, taking time to rest doesn't just help you feel better, it can also help you perfect your ideas. When you're not constantly thinking about something, your brain has a chance to relax and come up with new ideas. It's like, your mind needs a break to recharge and come up with fresh thoughts.  And who doesn't want fresh thoughts? 

Now, I know some people might think that taking breaks means you're not working hard enough, but I think that's just not true. It's important to find a balance between staying busy and taking time to rest. Like, if you're always working on something without taking a break, you might start to overthink things and get stressed out. And no one wants to be stressed out, right? 

So, in conclusion, Thomas Jefferson was totally onto something when he said that always doing something and taking time to rest is important. It's like, our brains need a break to work properly, and taking time to rest can help us perfect our ideas and come up with new ones.  And who doesn't want that? 

Anyway, that's my essay on why Thomas Jefferson advocated for always doing something and taking time to rest. I hope you liked it!  Let me know what you think in the comments!",1,llama2_chat,3

But, thanks to imagination, we have these amazing stories and characters that transport us to different worlds and make us feel things we never thought possible. 

And it's not just movies, dude.  Imagination is like, the foundation of innovation.  Like, think about it. Most of the coolest inventions and ideas started with someone just imagining something that didn't exist yet.  Like, who would have thought of things like, you know, the internet or electricity?  It's like, our imaginations are what make those things possible. 

But, you know what's even better than just making new things?  Using imagination to bring joy to others.  Like, think about it. When we use our imaginations to create art or music or stories, we're not just making something for ourselves.  We're sharing it with others and bringing happiness into their lives.  It's like, the best feeling in the world. 

So, yeah.  I think imagination is way more important than knowledge.  Don't get me wrong, knowledge is cool and all, but without imagination, we wouldn't have any of the amazing things that make life worth living.

And lastly, we can be active for our health!  Like, exercise is important, duh!  But seriously, it's not just about looking good in those Instagram selfies (although, let's be real, that's a nice side effect too 😉). Exercise can help us feel more energized, boost our mood, and even improve our sleep!  So, let's hit the gym, go for a run, or even just play a game of tag with our friends!

"Hey there!  So, I'm gonna write this essay about the benefits of having a positive attitude and how it can help us achieve success in life. 

First off, having a positive attitude is like, super important. It's like, the foundation of success, you know? When you're positive, you're more likely to take risks, try new things, and not be afraid of failure. Like, if you're positive that you're gonna succeed, you're more likely to put in the effort and not give up. And that's like, a big deal.

For example, like, if you're trying out for the basketball team, and you're feeling nervous and unsure of yourself, you're less likely to try your hardest. But if you're positive and confident, you're more likely to give it your all and show off your skills. And that's how you make the team! 

And it's not just sports. Having a positive attitude can help you in all areas of life. Like, if you're positive and enthusiastic in class, you're more likely to pay attention and learn stuff. And that means you'll do better on tests and stuff.  Plus, it's just more fun to learn when you're positive and excited.

And speaking of excitement, spending time with positive people is like, super important too. When you're around people who are positive and supportive, it rubs off on you. You start to feel more positive and confident, and that can help you achieve your goals. Like, if you're trying to start a business, and you surround yourself with people who are positive and supportive, you're more likely to stay motivated and keep going. 

And, you know, showing respect and responsibility to others is also like, really important. When you treat people well and show them respect, they're more likely to want to help you and support you. And that can lead to all sorts of opportunities and success. Like, if you're nice to your teachers, they're more likely to give you extra help and support, and that can help you do better in school. *sm",1,llama2_chat,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having extended periods of summer break and short breaks for the other seasons has numerous benefits for students. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of these breaks and why they are essential for a student's well-being.

Firstly, extended periods of summer break provide students with an opportunity to recharge and refresh their minds. After a long academic year, students can take a break from their studies and engage in activities that they enjoy. This break can be spent with family, friends, or pursuing hobbies and interests. By taking a break, students can reduce their stress levels and improve their overall mental health.

Secondly, short breaks for the other seasons can also have a similar effect. For example, during the winter months, students can take a break from their studies to spend time with family and friends, or engage in winter activities such as skiing or snowboarding. During the spring, students can take a break to enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking or biking. These short breaks can provide students with a much-needed break from their studies and help them recharge for the upcoming academic year.

Moreover, extended periods of summer break and short breaks for the other seasons can also provide students with an opportunity to catch up on their studies. During the summer months, students can take advantage of the extra time to review their coursework and prepare for the upcoming academic year. Similarly, during the other seasons, students can use their break time to catch up on any missed assignments or study for upcoming exams.

Finally, having extended periods of summer break and short breaks for the other seasons can also help students develop important life skills. For example, during the summer months, students can take on internships or part-time jobs to gain work experience and develop their resume. During the other seasons, students can take on leadership roles in extracurricular activities or volunteer work to develop their leadership skills.

In conclusion, I believe that having extended periods of summer break and short breaks for the other seasons has numerous benefits for students.

Therefore, I urge schools to consider implementing these breaks as part of their academic calendar.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have experienced online classes firsthand, and I believe that there are both pros and cons to attending classes online. While online classes offer convenience and flexibility, they also present challenges and difficulties that students must overcome. In this essay, I will evaluate the pros and cons of attending classes online, identify the difficulties students may face, analyze the impact of the online learning environment, examine the potential pitfalls of attending online classes, and research ways to overcome the issues of attending classes online.

One of the main advantages of attending classes online is the convenience and flexibility that it offers. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which eliminates the need for commuting and the hassle of waking up early to get to school. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as part-time jobs or family responsibilities. Additionally, online classes often offer a wider range of courses and programs, which can help students pursue their interests and passions.

However, attending classes online also presents several challenges and difficulties. One of the main challenges is the lack of interaction and socialization that online classes offer. Students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers and teachers, which can make it difficult to form meaningful relationships and seek help when needed. Additionally, online classes require a high level of self-discipline and motivation, as students must manage their time and stay on track with their coursework. This can be especially challenging for students who struggle with procrastination or time management.

Another challenge of attending classes online is the potential for technical difficulties and issues with the online learning platform. Students may experience technical problems, such as slow internet connections or software glitches, which can disrupt their learning and cause frustration. Additionally, some students may struggle to adapt to the online learning environment and may require additional support and guidance to succeed.

Despite these challenges, there are ways to overcome the issues of attending classes online. One effective strategy is to establish a routine and schedule for online classes, which can help students stay organized and on track with their coursework. Additionally, students can seek out opportunities for socialization and interaction, such as online discussion forums or virtual study groups, to connect with their peers and teachers. Finally, students can seek out additional support and guidance from their teachers or academic advisors to help them overcome any technical or academic challenges they may face.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0

"Hey there!  So, the big question on everyone's mind these days is whether or not we should extend the school day. Like, I get it, more learning is always good, but is it really worth it?

"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about my future and what I want to do after high school. Some people might think that graduating early is a good idea, but I'm not so sure.

One advantage of graduating early is that you get to explore different career paths before everyone else. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can take some college classes and get a head start on your education. Or, if you want to be an artist, you can take some art classes and get a feel for what it's like to be in college. This can be really helpful because you can figure out what you want to do and what you're good at before everyone else does.

Another advantage is that you get to take some extra classes and get a head start on your education. This can be really helpful if you want to get into a good college or if you want to learn something new. For example, you can take a math class or a science class and get a better understanding of the material before everyone else.

But there are also some disadvantages to graduating early. One of the biggest disadvantages is that you might not be ready for the workload of college. College is a lot harder than high school, and if you're not used to it, you might struggle to keep up. Additionally, you might not have as much time to relax and have fun, which can be really important for your mental health.

Another disadvantage is that you might miss out on some important experiences that you would have if you stayed in high school for another year. For example, you might not have as much time to hang out with your friends or to participate in extracurricular activities. This can be really sad because you might miss out on some of the best times of your life.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to graduating early, there are also some disadvantages. It's important to think carefully about your decision and make sure that you're ready for the challenges of college before you decide to graduate early.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Technology has had a profound impact on people's lives. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and entertain ourselves. While it has brought about many positive changes, it has also had negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore the effects of technology on people's lives, both positive and negative.

One of the most significant positive effects of technology is the way it has transformed communication. With the advent of social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing, people can now connect with each other from anywhere in the world. This has allowed for more efficient and effective communication, particularly in the workplace. For example, employees can collaborate on projects in real-time, even if they are working remotely. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away.

Another positive effect of technology is the way it has changed the way we work. With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, many jobs that were once done by humans can now be done more efficiently and accurately by machines. This has led to increased productivity and efficiency in many industries. For example, self-driving cars have the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry by reducing accidents and increasing safety.

However, while technology has brought about many positive changes, it has also had negative consequences. One of the most significant negative effects of technology is the way it has impacted our mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media and other digital devices can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. This is particularly true for young people who are more likely to be affected by these negative effects. For example, some studies have shown that teenagers who spend more time on their phones are more likely to experience depression and anxiety.

Another negative effect of technology is the way it has impacted our privacy. With the rise of data collection and surveillance, people's personal information is being collected and stored by companies and governments without their consent. This has led to concerns about data breaches and identity theft. For example, the Cambridge Analytica scandal showed how personal data can be used for political purposes without people's knowledge or consent.

In conclusion, technology has had a profound impact on people's lives. While it has brought about many positive changes, it has also had negative consequences. It is important to be aware of these effects and to use technology in",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

So, you know how people always say ""figure out what you want to be when you grow up""? Yeah, I'm still trying to figure that out. But, I guess it's important to have a plan, right? Like, picking a career and stuff. My counselor keeps talking about how it's good to have a career path in mind when you enter high school. She says it can open up opportunities and stuff. But, I don't know...

I mean, I'm only in 8th grade, so I gotta focus on school stuff first, you know? But, I guess it would be cool to have a plan. Like, maybe I could be an engineer or something. My dad's a mechanic, so I'm pretty good with cars. Or maybe I could be a doctor. My mom's always getting sick, so I could help her out.  But, I don't know...

My friend Sarah's mom is a lawyer, and she's like, super smart and stuff. Maybe I could be a lawyer too. But, I don't know if I'm smart enough.  And, there's so many other careers to choose from! It's like, how am I supposed to decide?!

My school doesn't really offer any career-specific programs or anything, but I heard some schools do. Like, my friend Jack's school has this thing where you can take classes in different fields and stuff. That sounds pretty cool, I guess. But, I don't know if I could handle that much extra work. 

I guess the pros of choosing a career early are that you get to start preparing and stuff. Like, you can take classes that are related to your career and get experience. And, you can start building your network and stuff. But, the cons are that you might miss out on other opportunities. Like, maybe you could've done something else if you didn't have a career plan. And, you might not be as flexible if you're stuck on one thing.

"Hey there!  I'm super excited to write this essay about how failure and perseverance can lead to success, just like some pretty cool people throughout history.  I mean, who doesn't love learning about successful people and how they became that way? 

So, let's dive right in! One person who totally comes to mind is Thomas Edison.  You know, the guy who invented the light bulb.  But did you know he actually failed over a thousand times before he finally got it right?  Like, what?! How did he even manage that?  But seriously, his perseverance and determination are seriously inspiring. He didn't give up, even when things got tough, and look where it got him! 

Another person who's pretty cool is J.K. Rowling.  You know, the author of Harry Potter?  She was rejected by twelve publishers before one finally picked up her book.  Can you imagine?! Twelve times!  But she didn't let that stop her. She kept going, and now she's one of the most successful authors ever! 

And let's not forget about Michael Jordan.  The basketball legend who was cut from his high school basketball team.  Can you imagine?!  But he didn't let that get him down. He kept practicing and working on his game, and now he's considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time! 

Okay, so what can we learn from these stories?  Well, for one thing, failure is totally normal.  Like, who hasn't failed at something?  But it's how we respond to failure that matters. Do we give up and give in, or do we keep going and push through?  It's all about perseverance and determination.

"Graduating from school is an important milestone that many students look forward to. It signifies the end of a long journey of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. As an eighth-grade student, I have been working towards this goal for several years, and I believe that graduating is essential for my future success.

Firstly, graduating from school offers numerous benefits, including increased earning potential, better job opportunities, and the ability to pursue higher education. Studies have shown that individuals with a college degree earn more annually than those without one. Additionally, many employers require a high school diploma or higher education degree for certain positions, making it difficult for individuals without a degree to find employment.

Secondly, graduating from school is necessary to achieve many of our goals. For example, many careers require a certain level of education, and without a high school diploma or higher education degree, it can be challenging to secure a job in that field. Additionally, many individuals dream of pursuing higher education, which typically requires a high school diploma as a prerequisite.

Thirdly, passing classes can be challenging, but it is a necessary part of graduating from school. The difficulty of passing classes varies depending on the subject and the student's abilities, but it requires hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn.

Fourthly, there are many things that cannot be achieved without a high school diploma or higher education degree. For example, many individuals cannot obtain a driver's license without a high school diploma. Additionally, many jobs require a certain level of education, and without a degree, it can be difficult to find employment.

Lastly, graduating from school is a significant accomplishment that many students look forward to. It represents the end of a long journey of hard work and dedication, and it is a testament to the student's abilities and potential. Graduating from school is a milestone that many students will remember for the rest of their lives.

In conclusion, graduating from school is essential for many reasons. It offers increased earning potential, better job opportunities, and the ability to pursue higher education. It is necessary to achieve many of our goals, including finding employment in certain fields. Passing classes can be challenging, but it is a necessary part of graduating.

"Topic: The correlation between confidence and decision making

As an 8th grader, I believe that confidence plays a crucial role in decision making. When we are confident in our abilities, we are more likely to make decisions that are in our best interest. On the other hand, when we lack confidence, we may struggle to make decisions and may end up making choices that are not beneficial to us.

For example, imagine a student who is applying for a summer camp. If they are confident in their abilities and believe that they will be accepted, they are more likely to fill out the application form and submit it. However, if they lack confidence, they may hesitate and not apply at all. This can lead to missed opportunities and a lack of growth.

Another example is in the workplace. A confident employee is more likely to take on new challenges and pursue promotions, while an employee who lacks confidence may stick to their comfort zone and not take risks. This can limit their career growth and success.

Research has shown that confidence can affect decision making in various ways. One study found that people who are confident in their abilities are more likely to take risks and make decisions that are outside of their comfort zone. Another study found that confidence can influence the way we process information and make decisions. When we are confident, we are more likely to trust our instincts and make decisions based on our gut feelings.

However, it's important to note that too much confidence can also be detrimental to decision making. When we are overconfident, we may become arrogant and ignore other perspectives and information. This can lead to poor decision making and negative consequences.

In conclusion, confidence plays a significant role in decision making. When we are confident in our abilities, we are more likely to make decisions that are in our best interest. However, it's important to strike a balance between confidence and humility, and to consider other perspectives and information when making decisions. By doing so, we can make informed and effective decisions that benefit ourselves and those around us.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Sure thing! Here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student responding to the prompt:

Hey, guys, I'm gonna write about why it's impossible to judge someone by their first impressions. I think this is a really important topic because, like, we all do it, right? We meet someone new and we're like, ""Oh, they're so cool!"" or ""Ugh, they're so annoying!"" But then sometimes we realize that they're actually really nice or really mean, and it's like, whoa, I totally judged them wrong!

So, my first impression of this essay prompt was like, ""Ugh, I don't wanna do it."" But then I started thinking about it, and I realized that it's totally possible to judge someone by their first impressions. Like, if someone walks into a room and they're wearing a super fancy outfit and they're talking really loudly, you might think they're really full of themselves. But then you find out they're actually really nice and they're just trying to make a good impression.

But then there are also times when you might think someone is really mean or whatever, and then you find out they're actually really nice once you get to know them. Like, my friend Emily, she's always really quiet in class and she never talks to anyone, but then we hang out outside of school and she's like, the funniest person ever! I never would have guessed.

So, I think it's important to not judge people by their first impressions because they might not be accurate. Like, you might think someone is really mean, but then you find out they're actually really nice. Or you might think someone is really cool, but then you find out they're actually really weird. It's just too unpredictable, you know?

In conclusion, judging someone by their first impressions is impossible because you never know what someone is really like until you get to know them. So, next time you meet someone new, try to be more open-minded and don't judge them too quickly. Thanks for reading, guys! 😊",1,llama2_chat,2
"In today's world, students are constantly being praised for their work, whether they put in a lot of effort or not. While some people believe that glorifying a student's work can help them to build self-esteem, I believe that the opposite is also true. Praising a student's work can actually have a negative impact on their self-esteem, especially if they do not feel like they deserve the praise.

One reason why some people might believe that praising a student's work can help them to be self-confident is that it provides them with a sense of accomplishment. When they receive praise for their work, they feel like they have achieved something and that their efforts were worth it. This can give them the confidence to continue working hard and to believe in their abilities.

However, I believe that this effect is short-lived and can actually be counterproductive in the long run. If a student does not feel like they deserve the praise they are receiving, they may begin to doubt their abilities and feel like a fraud. This can lead to a decrease in self-esteem and a lack of motivation to continue working hard.

Additionally, praising a student's work can create unrealistic expectations. If a student is constantly praised for their work, they may begin to believe that they are capable of achieving anything they set their mind to. However, this is not always the case, and if they are unable to meet these expectations, they may feel like a failure and their self-esteem may suffer.

In conclusion, while praising a student's work can provide them with a sense of accomplishment in the short term, it can also have a negative impact on their self-esteem in the long run. Instead of praising a student's work, it is important to provide them with constructive feedback and to help them develop a growth mindset. This will allow them to learn from their mistakes and to continue working hard towards their goals, without the fear of failure.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Considering one's first impression when making decisions has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, we may be able to gain a quicker and informed understanding of a person or situation. On the other, our assumptions may be limited or misguided, preventing us from making truly objective decisions. Alternatively, when we wait to form a more complete opinion, there is the danger of procrastinating and making decisions too late. Still, this tactic gives us the opportunity to make informed decisions that take into account all information gathered over time. Ultimately, one's approach will depend on the situation at hand and the desired outcome.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Sure, here's my essay:

Character traits are like puzzle pieces that we constantly rearrange to fit in with the people around us. We pick up new traits from our family, friends, and even strangers we meet every day. Sometimes we might not even realize it, but the people we surround ourselves with can have a huge impact on who we become.

For example, my best friend Sarah is super outgoing and loves to make new friends. She's always introducing me to new people and encouraging me to be more social. Because of her, I've become more confident in social situations and have made some amazing friends myself. On the other hand, my older brother is really reserved and introverted, so I've inherited some of those traits from him too.

But it's not just the people we directly interact with who shape our character. Our environment can also play a big role. For instance, if I grow up in a neighborhood where everyone is really competitive, I might start to feel like I need to be more competitive too. Or if I go to a school where everyone is really focused on academics, I might start to value education more too.

I remember one time when I was in 6th grade, my family moved to a new neighborhood where everyone seemed really mean and cliquey. I felt really nervous and anxious about making friends, but my mom kept telling me to be myself and not worry about what others thought. Because of her encouragement, I started to embrace my quirky personality and found a group of friends who appreciated me for who I was.

In conclusion, the people we surround ourselves with and the environment we live in can have a huge impact on who we become as people. By being aware of these influences, we can make conscious choices about the traits we want to adopt and the ones we want to leave behind. So, be careful who you hang out with and where you live – it could shape your character in ways you never expected!",1,llama2_chat,1

Additionally, being active can help us become better people by leading to improved physical strength, mental focus, and enhanced discipline. People may argue that being active can be tiring and time-consuming, but this is incorrect. In reality, being active often results in increased energy levels that aid us in achieving both immediate and long-term goals. As being active increases mental capabilities, it can also help us develop our minds by improving memory and creativity. 

In conclusion, staying active is a great way to take care of our bodies and minds.

"Taking responsibility for oneself is one of the most important lessons we can learn in life. Doing so empowers us to make more of our own decisions, become more independent, and better manage our lives. It also allows us to work towards our own goals and ambitions, instead of relying on others. 

We can begin taking responsibility for ourselves as soon as possible in life. For example, set goals for yourself that you want to achieve and break these goals down into smaller, actionable tasks. This way, it will be easier for you to focus on what you need to do to move closer to the goal. In addition, budgeting and taking control of your finances are also important steps that you can take to become more responsible for yourself. Finally, think about your own decisions and whether or not they are healthy and beneficial. Consider the different outcomes of those decisions, and make sure they are aligned with your values and goals.

Taking responsibility for yourself is an important step in achieving success and happiness. It allows us to create our own paths and make our own decisions that will bring us closer to our own dreams and goals. We should strive to take responsibility for ourselves as soon as possible in life, because doing so empowers us to be independent and successful.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

"As technology continues to advance, it has become increasingly evident that limited human contact has had a positive impact on society in the United States. The use of technology has improved lives in numerous ways, including providing convenience for elderly individuals, offering a safe space for political discussion, providing an opportunity for less academically inclined students to learn, and fostering connections among people.

One of the most significant benefits of limited human contact through technology is the ability to provide convenience for elderly individuals. With the rise of telemedicine and remote monitoring devices, seniors can now receive medical care from the comfort of their own homes, without having to travel long distances or wait in long lines at the hospital. This has been particularly beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic, as seniors are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and are less likely to be able to receive care in a hospital setting.

Another way that technology has improved lives is by providing a safe space for political discussion. Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, have become popular tools for people to express their opinions and engage in political discourse. These platforms have allowed individuals to connect with like-minded individuals, share information, and have civil conversations without the fear of physical harm or harassment. This has been particularly important in recent years, as political polarization has increased and the risk of violence at political rallies and events has become more prevalent.

Technology has also provided an opportunity for less academically inclined students to learn. Online courses and educational resources have made it possible for individuals to learn at their own pace and in their own time. This has been particularly beneficial for individuals who may not have access to traditional educational resources, such as those living in rural areas or those with disabilities. Additionally, technology has made it possible for students to collaborate with their peers and teachers from around the world, providing them with a global perspective on their education.

Finally, technology has fostered connections among people. Social media platforms and messaging apps have made it possible for individuals to stay in touch with friends and family members from around the world. This has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people have been forced to isolate themselves and have been unable to travel. Additionally, technology has made it possible for individuals to connect with like-minded individuals and form new friendships, regardless of geographic location.

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a summer break is essential for students. While some may argue that students should be attending school year-round to keep their minds sharp, I believe that a summer break provides numerous benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of having a summer break for students and support my argument with evidence.

Firstly, having a summer break allows students to recharge and refresh their minds. After a long school year, students are exposed to a constant barrage of academic work, extracurricular activities, and social pressures. This can lead to burnout and exhaustion, which can negatively impact a student's academic performance. A summer break provides an opportunity for students to take a break from the rigors of school and engage in activities that they enjoy, such as traveling, spending time with family and friends, or pursuing hobbies. This time away from school can help students recharge their batteries and come back to school in the fall with renewed energy and focus.

Secondly, having a summer break allows students to explore new opportunities and experiences. Summer break provides an opportunity for students to travel, learn new skills, and broaden their horizons. For example, students can participate in summer camps, internships, or volunteer programs that allow them to gain valuable experiences and knowledge. These experiences can help students make informed decisions about their future careers and interests, which can ultimately lead to more successful academic and professional outcomes.

However, some may argue that having a summer break can lead to a decline in academic performance. Students may forget what they learned during the school year, or they may fall behind in their studies if they do not engage in academic activities during the summer. While it is true that students may forget some information during the summer, research has shown that the decline in academic performance is only temporary and that students are able to quickly catch up once school resumes. Additionally, many students engage in academic activities during the summer, such as taking online courses or attending summer school, which can help them maintain their academic performance.

In conclusion, I believe that having a summer break is essential for students. The benefits of a summer break, such as allowing students to recharge and refresh their minds, explore new opportunities and experiences, and maintain their academic performance, outweigh any potential drawbacks.

"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay!  So, the whole thing about whether class should be required or elective is like, a total debate. And I'm like, totally gonna give my two cents on it. 😅

First of all, let's talk about why class should be required.  Like, think about it. Arts classes are like, super important for us to learn and stuff. They help us develop our creativity, critical thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. And let's be real, who doesn't want to be more creative and stuff? 🎨🎶 It's like, essential for us to have these classes as part of our education. Plus, it's like, super fun! Who doesn't love making art or playing music? 😜

But, on the other hand, some people might be like, ""Ugh, I don't wanna take arts class. It's not my thing."" And that's totally fine! Everyone has their own interests and passions, and if arts isn't their thing, then they shouldn't be forced to take it. It's like, totally their choice. And honestly, I get it. I mean, I'm not super into sports, but I still have to take them because they're important for my health and stuff. 🏈🏃‍♀️

So, like, in conclusion, I think class should be required because it's important for us to learn and develop our skills, but also because it's super fun! And if people don't wanna take it, they can always choose to take an elective instead. It's like, totally fair and stuff. 🤷‍♀️🎨

Oh, and I totally forgot to mention that some people might not have access to arts classes because of, like, financial reasons or whatever. So, if class is required, then everyone can have the opportunity to learn and participate, no matter what. 💰🎨

"Currently, there is a policy in place to restrict the use of cell phones during school hours. While this policy is intended to ensure teachers and students can focus on their learning, it has proven to be somewhat ineffective. As a result, it is proposed that the current policy on cell phone use in the school be revised to provide a more balanced approach for both teachers and students. 

To achieve this, a few changes should be implemented. First, teachers should be allowed to carry their cell phones on-campus during school hours. This will allow them to stay connected to the outside world and provide an easy means of communication if necessary. 

Second, students should be allowed to use their phones for educational purposes only, such as using online dictionaries and conducting research. If students are seen using cell phones for any other activity, they should be subject to disciplinary action. 

Finally, stricter enforcement of the policy should be in place. For instance, teachers should check for phones during examinations and, if applicable, confiscate them from students who use them inappropriately. Lastly, the school should provide information to both teachers and students regarding the revised policy, so everyone is aware of what is expected of them

By introducing these changes, the current policy on cell phone use in the school can be revised to make it fair and effective for both teachers and students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

So, first off, having a positive attitude can help you achieve your goals.

And it's not just school stuff, either. If you're trying to get a job or start a business, you need to have a positive attitude.

I'm gonna make this the best job/business ever!"" then you're way more likely to succeed. 

And it's not just about achieving goals, either. Having a positive attitude can also help solve economy issues.

But, like, the best part about having a positive attitude is that it can make your day-to-day life way better too.

"In today's society, the education system has become increasingly focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. While these subjects are undeniably important, there is a growing debate over whether students should be required to take a class in the arts or other electives. In my opinion, students should be required to take electives as it provides numerous benefits, such as promoting creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth.

First and foremost, taking electives allows students to explore their interests and passions. By taking a class in the arts or another subject that they enjoy, students are more likely to engage in the learning process and retain the information presented. This can lead to increased motivation and a more positive attitude towards learning. Additionally, electives provide students with an opportunity to discover new interests and hobbies that they may not have known about otherwise.

Furthermore, taking electives can help students develop important life skills that are not typically taught in STEM subjects. For example, taking a class in music or theater can help students develop communication skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. These skills are essential for success in both personal and professional life.

However, some argue that requiring students to take electives can lead to students not taking the subject seriously. This is a valid concern, but it can be mitigated through proper implementation. Teachers can make electives more engaging and relevant to students' interests by incorporating real-world examples and hands-on activities. Additionally, schools can provide incentives for students to take electives, such as recognition on their transcript or awards for outstanding performance.

Another argument against requiring electives is that it takes away from students' focus on STEM subjects. However, this argument is flawed. While STEM subjects are important, they are not the only subjects that matter. A well-rounded education should include a variety of subjects, including the arts and humanities. By taking electives, students can broaden their knowledge and develop a more holistic understanding of the world.

In conclusion, requiring students to take electives is a positive policy that provides numerous benefits, such as promoting creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth. While there are valid concerns about students not taking the subject seriously, these can be mitigated through proper implementation. Additionally, it is important to remember that a well-rounded education should",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"In recent years, online learning has become increasingly popular, especially in the K-12 sector. While online classes have their advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. In this essay, I will analyze the potential pros and cons of students taking online classes from home, especially in K-12.

One of the main advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can attend class from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially convenient for those with busy schedules or who live far from the school. This flexibility can also allow students to learn at their own pace, as they can watch lectures and complete assignments on their own schedule.

Another advantage of online classes is that they often offer a wider range of courses than traditional brick-and-mortar schools. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a specific subject or career path that may not be available at their local school.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to online classes. One of the main concerns is that students may struggle with self-motivation and discipline. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may be more likely to procrastinate and fall behind on assignments.

Another potential drawback of online classes is that students may miss out on the socialization opportunities that come with attending school in person. This can be especially important for younger students who are still developing their social skills.

In conclusion, while online classes have their advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. Ultimately, the decision to take online classes from home should be based on a careful weighing of the pros and cons, and should be made in consultation with parents, teachers, and other relevant stakeholders.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Voting is a right that should be respected and pursued by everyone in a community. This applies particularly to students and teachers because, through their daily lives, they are making meaningful contributions to their school and wider society. Electing a president is a prime example of how an individual can make a difference in their local community. A president serves to represent students and teachers, and having a say on who will lead them is an important way to voice their opinions.

By voting, individuals may express their views in critical decision-making processes. Aside from the obvious benefit of having their choice reflected in the final outcome, the act of voting itself helps to promote fairness and eliminates any potential biases. Everyone is given the same opportunity to make a difference and all votes are counted equally. In this way, an individual's voice is not only heard, it is valued. 

Voting is a fundamental right that everyone has the privilege of taking part in. Through voting, individuals are able to contribute towards a fairer and democratic community. It is something that both students and teachers can practice in order to make their opinions known and effect real change.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Hey there! 

So, online classes.  I mean, they're a thing nowadays, right? Like, they're not just for super smart people who don't want to leave their homes or anything.  I've been doing some research on 'em, and I gotta say, they're pretty cool.

First of all, let's talk about the benefits.  Okay, so, you can take classes from anywhere. Like, literally anywhere. Your bed, your couch, your grandma's house.  It's like having a personal tutor, but way cooler. And you can do it on your own time, too. No more waking up early for classes, or sitting in a crowded lecture hall.  Plus, you can rewind and rewatch lectures as many times as you want.  It's like having a magic remote control for learning!

But,  there are some disadvantages, too.  See, sometimes the internet can be, like, really slow or something, and you can't hear the teacher properly.  And sometimes, you can't ask questions in real-time, so you gotta wait until the next day to get help.  And,  some people might not like the lack of face-to-face interaction.  I mean, I know I do, but some people might find it hard to focus without that human connection. 

But,  overall, I think online classes are pretty cool.  They can help students like me who might not be able to make it to a traditional classroom for whatever reason.  And they're just, like, really convenient.  So, yeah, I think online classes are the future of learning.  What do you think?

"Hey there!  Uh, so, you know, I've been thinking a lot about this whole ""doing something"" thing. Like, it's pretty important, you know? And Thomas Jefferson was totally right when he said ""determine never to be idle.""  Like, think about it, if we're always doing something, we're gonna get so much more done! 

I mean, just think about it. When we're not doing anything, we're not learning or growing or achieving our goals. We're just, like, sitting around doing nothing. And that's not good.  It's like, our brains are like, ""Hey, what are we doing? Oh, nothing.  Let's just sit here and do nothing."" And that's not how we get things done! 

But when we're always doing something, we're constantly learning and growing and achieving our goals. We're like, ""Okay, I want to learn how to play the guitar. So, I'm gonna pick up that guitar and practice every day.""  And then, before we know it, we're like, ""Whoa, I can play the guitar!  I accomplished something!"" 

And it's not just learning new things, it's also about, like, working towards our goals. Whether it's getting good grades or starting a business or, like, anything really. If we're always doing something, we're always moving towards our goals. We're not just sitting around, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for things to happen. 

So, yeah, I totally agree with Thomas Jefferson. It's wonderful how much we can do if we're always doing something.  It's like, the more we do, the more we can achieve. And that's just, like, totally awesome!

"Working in a group or alone is a common debate among students. Both options have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will investigate the benefits of working with a group or working alone in connection to successful school work. I will consider the advantages and disadvantages of both options and the effect on concentration to reach conclusions about which option yields more successful results.

Working in a group has several advantages. Firstly, it allows for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives to be shared and considered. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. Secondly, it provides an opportunity for students to learn from one another and to develop their communication and collaboration skills. Thirdly, it can provide a sense of community and support, which can be beneficial for mental health and wellbeing.

However, working in a group also has its disadvantages. Firstly, it can be difficult to manage and coordinate a group of people, which can be time-consuming and stressful. Secondly, it can be challenging to ensure that everyone is contributing equally and that the group is moving in the right direction. Thirdly, it can be difficult to maintain focus and concentration when working in a group, as there are often many different ideas and opinions being discussed.

Working alone, on the other hand, has its own set of advantages. Firstly, it allows for a more focused and individualized approach to work. This can be beneficial for students who work better when they have more control over their environment and pace. Secondly, it can be easier to maintain focus and concentration when working alone, as there are no distractions from other group members. Thirdly, it can provide a sense of autonomy and independence, which can be beneficial for self-esteem and confidence.

However, working alone also has its disadvantages. Firstly, it can be isolating and lonely, which can be detrimental to mental health and wellbeing. Secondly, it can be difficult to get feedback and support when working alone, which can be limiting in terms of growth and development. Thirdly, it can be challenging to maintain motivation and accountability when working alone, as there is no one else to hold oneself accountable.

In conclusion, both working in a group and working alone have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Working in a group can provide a diverse range",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey there!  So, I was given this assignment to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of attending a high school program that offers students the opportunity to graduate in three years versus four years. Like, I know some people might be thinking, ""Why would anyone want to graduate early? That's like, a whole year less of high school!"" But hear me out, okay?

First of all, let's talk about the advantages of graduating early.  One of the biggest pros is that you get to save time and money. Like, think about it. If you graduate in three years instead of four, you're basically saving yourself a whole year of tuition and fees for college. That's like, a bunch of money that you could be using for something else, like a sweet new gaming console or a trip to Hawaii!  And let's not forget about the time you'll save. You'll be able to start college earlier and get a head start on your degree, which means you'll be done with college sooner and can start your career even faster.

But,  there are also some disadvantages to graduating early.  For one thing, you might miss out on some important social experiences. Like, you won't have as much time to hang out with your friends or join clubs and organizations that you're interested in. And, you know, some people might view you as being weird or unmotivated if you graduate early. It's like, they don't understand that you're just trying to get ahead and save time and money. 

So, in conclusion,  I think that attending a high school program that offers students the opportunity to graduate in three years has both advantages and disadvantages. It's like, it's not for everyone, but it could be a good option for some people. You just have to weigh the pros and cons and decide what's best for you.  And, you know, maybe one day I'll be the one graduating early and saving myself a ton of time and money.",1,llama2_chat,2
"One of the steps that can be taken to make school lunches more enjoyable for students is to serve fresher, healthier foods. This can be achieved by including more fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as wholesome whole grains, lean proteins, and other healthful components. Additionally, school lunches should be prepared in a safe and hygienic manner, with kitchen staff following best practices of sanitizing and cooking food thoroughly. 

To address the potential consequence of removing popular items from school lunch menus, alternative foods can be offered as substitutes. The goal should be to provide options that still provide nutritional benefits, without sacrificing the taste and enjoyment for students. For example, healthier versions of macaroni and cheese, pizza, and taco dishes can be created that retain the traditional flavor profile while providing a nutrient-rich meal. 

By taking these steps, schools can create more enjoyable and nutritionally sound lunch options for their students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0

First of all, the pros. So, graduating early means we get to start college earlier, right?

"Homework Clubs: The Key to Unlocking Academic Success

As an 8th grader, I can attest to the challenges of juggling schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Balancing homework, sports, and social events can be overwhelming, and it's easy to fall behind on assignments. That's why I believe after-school homework clubs are essential for students like me. These clubs provide a structured environment where we can collaborate, get help when needed, and complete assignments efficiently.

Personally, I have struggled with completing homework on time. Many nights, I found myself staying up late, trying to finish assignments, only to wake up the next morning and realize I had made careless mistakes. This not only affected my grades but also caused stress and anxiety. However, since joining a homework club, I have noticed a significant improvement in my academic performance. Being surrounded by peers who are also working on their assignments motivates me to stay focused and complete my work.

One of the most significant benefits of homework clubs is the opportunity for collaboration. When we work together, we can help each other understand complex concepts and complete assignments more quickly. For instance, if I'm struggling with a particular math problem, my club members can help me work through it, and we can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. This not only helps us complete our assignments faster but also deepens our understanding of the material.

Another advantage of homework clubs is the improvement in communication and learning skills. When we work together, we learn how to express our ideas clearly, listen actively, and respond thoughtfully. These skills are essential for academic success and will benefit us throughout our lives. Additionally, homework clubs provide a safe space for students to ask questions, seek help, and learn from each other without feeling embarrassed or judged.

In this essay, we will explore the benefits of working with a group, specifically focusing on the aspects of self-awareness, improved interpersonal skills, and increased knowledge of life.

One of the most significant benefits of working with a group is the opportunity for self-awareness. When working with a group, individuals are exposed to a variety of perspectives and ideas. This exposure can help individuals become more aware of their own beliefs and values, as well as their own strengths and weaknesses. By reflecting on their own thoughts and ideas, individuals can gain a better understanding of themselves and their place in the world.

Another benefit of working with a group is the opportunity for improved interpersonal skills. When working with a group, individuals are forced to communicate and collaborate with others. This can help individuals develop their communication skills, as well as their ability to work effectively with others. By learning to listen actively, express their own ideas clearly, and compromise when necessary, individuals can improve their interpersonal skills and form stronger relationships with others.

Finally, working with a group can also provide individuals with increased knowledge of life. When working with a group, individuals are exposed to a variety of experiences and perspectives.

So, you know how sometimes you're like, ""Man, I wish I could just take my classes from the comfort of my own home""?  Well, distance learning is a thing now, and it's like, a real thing!  And I'm here to give you the lowdown on whether it's a good idea or not. 

First off, let's talk about the pros. !  Like, you can learn from the comfort of your own home, in your pajamas, with a bowl of popcorn .  Okay, maybe that's not a real thing, but you get the idea. You can learn at your own pace, which is super helpful if you're a visual learner or if you need a little extra time to understand something. Plus, you can save money on transportation and lunches .

You know how sometimes you need that extra help or clarification from a teacher?  Well, you might not get that with distance learning.

So, in conclusion , distance learning can be a good thing if you're disciplined enough to stay focused and organized.

"Self-reliance is a vital quality that can greatly benefit individuals in various aspects of their lives. Being able to rely on oneself and make decisions without relying on others can lead to increased confidence, independence, and problem-solving skills.

One of the most important aspects of self-reliance is the use of common sense. Having the ability to think critically and make sound decisions based on practical experience and knowledge can help individuals navigate challenging situations. For example, if a person is lost in the woods, they can use their common sense to find their way back to civilization by following landmarks, observing the sun, and using their senses to detect potential dangers.

Another important aspect of self-reliance is experience. The more a person experiences life, the more they will be able to rely on their own judgment and skills to handle difficult situations. For instance, a person who has experience camping in the wilderness will be better equipped to handle unexpected weather conditions or injuries than someone who has never been camping before.

Finally, independence is a key aspect of self-reliance. Being able to take care of oneself and not relying on others for everything can lead to a greater sense of autonomy and self-sufficiency. For example, a person who is able to fix their own car or repair their own home will be less likely to have to rely on others for help, which can lead to a greater sense of independence.

However, there is also a counterclaim to the value of self-reliance. Some argue that relying on oneself can lead to a lack of social skills and an inability to work well with others. For example, a person who is too independent may have difficulty collaborating with others on a project or asking for help when they need it.

To illustrate this counterclaim, consider the example of a person who is a skilled mechanic. While they may be able to fix their own car, they may struggle to work with a team of mechanics to diagnose and repair a complex problem. In this case, the person's self-reliance can actually hinder their ability to solve the problem.

In conclusion, self-reliance is a valuable quality that can lead to increased confidence, independence, and problem-solving skills. While there are some potential drawbacks",1,llama2_chat,4
"Sure, here's my essay on the pros and cons of distance learning for students:

Distance learning is a type of education where students learn through online classes instead of traditional in-person classes. As an 8th grader, I think distance learning has both pros and cons that can benefit different types of students in various ways.

One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the convenience it offers. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which is especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or live far away from the school. This means they can save time and energy that would be spent on commuting, and use it for other things like extracurricular activities or personal interests. Additionally, distance learning provides autonomy for students, as they can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.

Another benefit of distance learning is that it can be tailored to different types of learners. For example, visual learners can watch videos and animations to help them understand complex concepts, while auditory learners can listen to lectures and podcasts. This personalized approach can help students learn more effectively and efficiently.

However, there are also some disadvantages to distance learning. One of the biggest concerns is the lack of motivation and focus that students may experience. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may find it harder to stay on track and complete assignments on time. Additionally, distance learning can be isolating, which can lead to a lack of social interaction and communication skills.

Despite these drawbacks, I think distance learning can be beneficial for certain types of students. For example, students who are shy or have difficulty communicating in a traditional classroom setting may find it easier to participate in online classes. Similarly, students who have medical conditions or disabilities that make it hard for them to attend school in person may find distance learning a more accessible option.

In conclusion, while distance learning has both pros and cons, I believe it can be a valuable option for certain types of students. Its convenience and personalized approach can help students learn more effectively, and its flexibility can accommodate different learning styles. However, it's important to address the potential drawbacks, such as lack of motivation and isolation, to ensure that distance learning is a successful and enjoyable experience for all students.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student advocating for policy number 1 concerning phone usage in class:

Hey Principal [Name],

I think we should be able to use our phones in class more. I know some people might say it's distracting, but I think it could actually help us learn better. Here are some reasons why:

First, phones are like little computers that we carry around with us everywhere. So, if we can use them in class, we can look up things that we don't understand right away. Like, if we're learning about a new topic in science and we don't get it, we can look it up on our phones and learn more about it. That way, we can understand it better and do better in class.

Second, phones can help us stay organized. We can use our calendars and reminders to make sure we don't forget important assignments or tests. And we can use our notes app to take notes in class and study them later. That way, we can review what we learned and make sure we don't forget anything.

Third, phones can help us communicate with our teachers and classmates. If we have a question about something we're learning, we can ask our teacher or classmates on our phone. That way, we can get help right away and not fall behind. And if we're working on a group project, we can use our phones to communicate with our group members and share ideas.

I know some people might say that phones are distracting, but I think they can actually help us learn better. If we're allowed to use our phones in class, we can use them to learn new things and communicate with our teachers and classmates. So, I think policy number 1 is a good idea and I hope you'll consider it.

Sincerely,

"Hey there! 

So, the question is, is it important to keep growing and striving beyond what we've already achieved? Like, I mean, I know some people who are like, ""I'm good, I don't need to do anything else,"" but I think that's, like, super limiting. 

First of all, let's talk about how growing and striving can be beneficial. When we challenge ourselves to do new things and learn new skills, it's like, our brains get this cool workout, you know? It's like, ""Hey, you did that thing, now let's do something harder!"" And it's like, ""Okay, cool, I'm down!"" 

Plus, when we keep pushing ourselves, we can achieve things we never thought were possible. Like, I never thought I could run a mile without getting winded, but then I started training and now I can do it in like, 5 minutes!  And it's like, ""Woah, look at me go!"" 

But, on the other hand, stagnancy can be, like, super bad. When we stop trying new things and just settle for what we have, it's like, our minds start to get all, like, mushy and stuff.  It's like, ""Ugh, I'm so bored with this one thing I've been doing for forever."" And it's like, ""Yeah, me too, bro."" 

And also, when we don't keep growing and striving, we can miss out on, like, all these other cool things we could be experiencing. It's like, ""Oh, I could've learned how to play the guitar if I hadn't been so comfortable with just playing video games all the time."" 

So, in conclusion, I think it's super important to keep growing and striving beyond what we've already achieved. It's like, it keeps our minds sharp and stuff, and it opens up all these new possibilities for us.",1,llama2_chat,4
"The Importance of Having a Positive Attitude for Success

Having a positive attitude is crucial for success in all areas of life, including work, school, and personal relationships. A positive attitude can help individuals overcome obstacles, achieve their goals, and maintain healthy relationships with others. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of having a positive attitude, the mistakes people make when they lack a positive attitude, and the ways in which having a positive attitude can lead to success.

One of the most significant benefits of having a positive attitude is that it can help individuals overcome obstacles and challenges. When faced with adversity, people with a positive attitude are more likely to see the situation as an opportunity for growth and learning, rather than a setback. This mindset allows them to approach challenges with a sense of optimism and determination, which can help them find solutions and achieve their goals.

Another benefit of having a positive attitude is that it can improve performance in the workplace. Studies have shown that employees with a positive attitude are more productive, creative, and engaged than those with a negative attitude. This is because they are more motivated to work hard and achieve their goals, and they are more likely to collaborate with their colleagues and contribute to a positive work environment.

In school, having a positive attitude can help students achieve better academic performance and maintain healthy relationships with their peers. Students with a positive attitude are more likely to approach learning with a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm, which can help them retain information and perform better on tests and assignments. They are also more likely to seek help when needed and work collaboratively with their peers, which can help them build strong relationships and learn from one another.

However, when individuals lack a positive attitude, they may make mistakes that can hinder their success. For example, they may become overly critical or negative, which can lead to decreased motivation and productivity. They may also become defensive or argumentative, which can harm their relationships with others. Additionally, they may give up too easily, which can prevent them from achieving their goals and realizing their full potential.

To maintain a positive attitude despite adversity, individuals can practice mindfulness and self-reflection. Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and focusing on the present rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Self-reflection involves taking time to reflect on one's thoughts, feelings, and",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I am excited to apply for the opportunity to participate in the [Organization Name] program. This program offers a unique and valuable experience for students who are passionate about [specific interest or field]. In this essay, I will research the opportunities offered by the organization, including the number of participants, environment, correct and incorrect teaching methods, and the qualities required for the position. Additionally, I will discuss how my own qualities make me a good fit for the program.

First, let's look at the number of participants in the program. According to the organization's website, the program is open to a limited number of students each year. This means that there is a competitive element to the application process, and only the most qualified candidates will be selected. As an eighth-grade student, I understand the importance of being competitive and standing out in a crowded field. I am confident that my strong work ethic and dedication to my interests will make me a strong candidate for the program.

Next, let's consider the environment in which the program takes place. The organization's website states that the program takes place in a [specific location or setting]. This could be a university campus, a research facility, or even a remote location. Regardless of the environment, I believe that I would thrive in this setting. I am comfortable working independently and in a group setting, and I am excited about the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with other students and professionals in the field.

In terms of teaching methods, the organization's website states that they use a variety of methods to engage and educate their participants. Some of these methods may include lectures, hands-on activities, and group projects. I believe that these methods are effective in helping students to learn and retain information. However, I also believe that there are some incorrect teaching methods that may be used in the program. For example, some teachers may rely too heavily on lectures and not provide enough opportunities for hands-on learning. As a student, I have found that I learn best when I am actively engaged in the material, and I believe that this is true for most students.

Finally, let's look at the qualities required for the position. The organization's website states that they are looking for students who are passionate about the field, have strong academic records, and demonstrate leadership potential. I believe that these",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that students with a C average or lower should be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. While it is important for students to maintain a certain level of academic performance, it is also important to recognize that not all students are able to achieve a B average.

Firstly, it is important to consider the fact that students with a C average or lower may be doing their best to pass their classes. It is possible that they are struggling with certain subjects or facing personal challenges that make it difficult for them to maintain a higher grade. By allowing these students to participate in sports and other activities, we can provide them with an opportunity to develop other skills and interests outside of the classroom.

Secondly, it is important to recognize that students with a C average or lower may not be able to participate in sports and other activities if they are required to maintain a B average. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling academically, as it may be even more difficult for them to meet both the academic and extracurricular requirements.

Finally, it is important to consider the fact that students who do not meet the B average requirement would still be able to experience activities outside of the classroom. This means that they will still have the opportunity to develop social skills, teamwork, and leadership skills, which are all important for personal and professional development.

In conclusion, I believe that students with a C average or lower should be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. By doing so, we can provide them with an opportunity to develop other skills and interests outside of the classroom, while also recognizing that not all students are able to maintain a higher grade. Additionally, allowing these students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them develop important social and leadership skills, which will benefit them in the future.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Excerpt: 

Ralph Waldo Emerson is a renowned philosopher and poet whose works are still quoted today. One of his most renowned quotes is, “Growth is the only evidence of life.” In this quote, Emerson explores the importance of growth in our lives. Growth, in its many forms, is essential to living a fulfilling life. It can be seen through the physical, mental, and emotional changes that people experience throughout their life. But more than just being a natural part of life, growth is also something that requires dedication and effort to attain. People must be actively involved in the process of personal development. Whether through intellectual pursuits, creative expression, or forging meaningful connections, people must seek out opportunities to grow and be open to the change that comes along with it. By doing this, they will be more able to use the growth that they encounter to become the best version of themselves.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey there!  So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole three year high school program thing, and I gotta say, it's like, really interesting.  I mean, on one hand, it's like, totally cool that we get to take elective courses and explore our passions earlier on. Like, I'm really into photography, and I'm glad I get to take that class this year.  But, on the other hand, it's like, kinda stressful to rush through final year courses. I mean, I wanna make sure I have enough time to learn everything I need to before college. 

So, here's my argument: I think students should have the option to graduate high school in three years.  I know some people might be like, ""But wait, how will they get enough time to learn everything?!"" And I get that, but hear me out.  If we have the option to graduate early, we can focus more on our college prep courses and make sure we're fully prepared for college. Plus, it's like, super motivating to know that we can finish high school early and start college sooner.  And let's be real, who doesn't want to get out of high school a little early? 

But, like, there are also some drawbacks to consider.  Some people might be like, ""But what about extracurriculars? I wanna have time to join clubs and sports!"" And I get that too.  But, like, I think we can manage.  We can still join clubs and sports, we just might have to prioritize a little more.  And honestly, I think the benefits of graduating early outweigh the drawbacks. 

So, there you have it.  In conclusion, I think students should have the option to graduate high school in three years. It's like, totally worth it.  Thanks for reading my essay!",1,llama2_chat,3
"Growing up, I was entranced by the beautiful sound of the violin—a classical instrument which has been in existence since the 16th century in Europe. I was enchanted by the complexity and range of emotion that the instrument could convey when played skillfully. As I conducted research into the instrument's history, I developed an even greater appreciation for its extraordinary heritage and the history of its renowned composers.  

I eagerly signed up for violin lessons. However, I soon realized that learning to play the violin is an incredibly taxing process that requires immense dedication, time, and focus to become proficient. You need to practice regularly in order to ensure that you can play the instrument comfortably and develop both musical and technical skills such as knowing fingering positions, posture, and having an overall command of the instrument’s sound. 

My first experiences taking violin lessons were humbling. I was surrounded by much more experienced and knowledgeable musicians, yet the teacher was patient with me and helped me gradually become more comfortable and confident with the instrument. Despite the initial difficulty, I saw firsthand the sheer joy of mastering a new piece and was inspired by those around me to push my limits and strive to get to the point of being able to perform confidently.

At the same time, I realized the detrimental consequences of not practicing regularly. Neglecting practice can lead to slipping technical ability, as well as a loss of confidence and motivation. Through this experience, my attitude and perspective on the violin shifted from a source of struggle to a place of peace and comfort. Today, I am able to take immense joy in playing the violin, something that I never imagined I would be doing.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Wow, this is such an amazing opportunity! As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to research and write about one of the most iconic football clubs in the world - Barcelona FC! 🏈🔥

First of all, let's talk about the history of Barcelona FC. The club was founded in 1899 by a group of football enthusiasts, and since then, it has grown to become one of the most successful and beloved teams in the world. From its humble beginnings in the Spanish Second Division, Barcelona has risen to become a global powerhouse, winning numerous domestic and international titles, including five Champions League trophies! 🏆

Now, let's talk about some of the changes that Barcelona FC has undergone since its formation. One of the most significant changes has been the club's shift towards a more youthful and diverse team. In recent years, Barcelona has prioritized developing young talent from its own academy, rather than relying on expensive transfers from other clubs. This has led to the emergence of talented players like Ansu Fati, Pedri, and Gavi, who are already making waves in the football world. 🔥👀

Another major change at Barcelona FC is the increased focus on marketing and branding. The club has expanded its reach through various channels, including social media, merchandise, and even theme parks! 🎢🏆 It's crazy to think that a football club can have its own theme park, but hey, it's working for Barcelona! 😅

Moving on to the salaries of players, it's no secret that Barcelona FC has some of the highest-paid players in the world. Lionel Messi, the club's captain and arguably the greatest footballer of all time, earns a whopping $50 million per year! 💸🔥 Of course, not everyone can afford to pay these salaries, but it's clear that Barcelona FC is willing to invest in its players to ensure their success on the pitch. 🏆

Today, cell phones have become an integral part of our lives. With their ever-increasing capabilities, cell phones have become an extension of our everyday life. As educators and parents, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of allowing students to use their cell phones during school hours.

Research has shown that allowing students to use their cell phones in school may bring numerous benefits. Cell phones can provide students with valuable educational resources, allowing them access to educational materials right at their fingertips. In addition, cell phones can be used for emergency situations, providing students with a tool to quickly contact an administrator in case of an emergency.

On the other hand, there are some concerning disadvantages to allowing cell phones in school. Allowing cell phones in school could lead to distractions and decreases in student focus. There is also the potential for cyberbullying through text messages or social media posts.

Therefore, when it comes to allowing students to use their cell phones during school hours, careful consideration should be taken. We must weigh the potential risks with the potential educational benefits of cell phones in order to properly assess its use in the classroom. It is my belief that an appropriate cell phone usage policy should be implemented, providing necessary guidance and regulation for students to use cell phones in an appropriate and educational manner.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Choosing good traits for ourselves is an essential part of achieving personal growth and success. Good traits such as honesty, discipline, respect, and responsibility foster positive interactions with others, and encourage us to pursue our goals and ambitions. Good traits also serve to boost our self-esteem and confidence, and boost our willpower and perseverance.

On the other hand, bad traits such as dishonesty, laziness, selfishness, and disrespect only serve to undermine our capacity to achieve our goals. Bad traits put strain on our relationships with others, and can limit our potential for achieving our goals. Bad traits often lead to feelings of bitterness, anger, and resentment, and can lead to a negative self-image.

Ultimately, it is important to choose good traits for ourselves because they promote a positive outlook on life and help us to be more successful in achieving our goals. Good traits foster healthy relationships, boost our self-esteem, and serve as inspiration for pursuing our ambitions.

"One of the major benefits of being able to attend school from home is the increased convenience for students who would otherwise find it difficult to find the time to attend a traditional educational setting. Home schooled students can often take courses at their own pace and structure their daily schedules however they choose, without the need to be tied to a specific school day or class hours. Additionally, students who are home schooled are often able to learn in an environment free of external distractions, which can help them to better focus on their work. 

However, home schooling can create some potential drawbacks as well. Home schooled students may lack the in-person social interactions of traditional education or the structure of the school day, which can lead to decreased motivation and attendance issues. Additionally, home schooled students may also struggle to gain the job preparation skills that come from a more traditional learning environment, such as becoming comfortable in a professional atmosphere, building good interview skills, or networking. 

Overall, there are both clear benefits and drawbacks to being able to attend school from home. It is important for potential students to consider these before making a decision about how to best pursue their educational goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4

I knew I wanted to be successful, but was finding it difficult to make decisions about the path I should take. Setting a goal helped to narrow my focus, giving me an achievable target that I could set my sights on. At the same time, I also realized that the journey could be filled with obstacles and required hard work and dedication in order to achieve it. 

By focusing on small achievable tasks each day, I was able to slowly progress towards my goal. Additionally, I was driven forward by the inspiration of others and their success stories.

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, y'all! Today we're gonna talk about this dope quote from Michelangelo: ""The greatest danger for a sculptor is not to practice his art."" I think it's pretty cool how he thinks that just doing something you love can lead to success. But, like, what happens when you set really high goals and you don't reach 'em? That's what I wanna find out.

So, setting high goals is like, super important, right? Like, if you don't set any goals, you'll never achieve anything. But, if you set really high goals and you don't reach 'em, it can be, like, really disappointing. I mean, you're all pumped up and stuff, but then you fall short and it's like, whoa, what just happened?! But, on the other hand, setting low goals is like, not that great either. Like, if you don't set any goals at all, you'll never know if you could've done better. So, it's like, you gotta find that balance, you know?

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""Why do I gotta set high goals? I'm just gonna fail anyway."" But, like, think about it. When you set high goals, you're showing yourself that you believe in yourself. You're like, ""Hey, I can do this!""

"Hey there!  So, I've been doing some research on this whole year-round school thing, and I gotta say, it's pretty interesting. Some people think it's a great idea, while others are like, ""Uh, no thanks."" Let me break it down for you.

So, the argument for year-round school is that it would help students learn more and retain information better. They say that since kids don't get as much time off during the year, they can keep learning without those pesky summer brain drain moments. Plus, it would give teachers more time to plan and prepare lessons without having to cram everything into a few months. Makes sense, right?

But, here's the thing.  Some people think it's just not worth it. They say that summer break is important for kids to relax, recharge, and do things they enjoy. Without it, they might get burnt out or feel like they're always in school mode. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good summer vacation? 

Now, I know some people are like, ""But what about the negatives of summer break?"" And I'm like, ""Yeah, okay, I see your point.""  See, some people think that summer break can be a time when kids forget what they learned during the year. Like, they might forget how to multiply or something.  And some kids might not have access to resources or opportunities during the summer, so they might fall behind. That's not cool.

But, here's the thing. There are alternatives to year-round school that could solve some of these problems. Like, some schools have shorter summer breaks and longer breaks during the year. Or, they could have flexible schedules that let kids take breaks when they need them. That way, they can still learn and have time off when they need it.

"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that participation in a sport, club, or after school activity is essential for all students. While some may argue that students have other priorities such as academics and socializing, I believe that extracurricular activities provide numerous benefits that cannot be overlooked.

First and foremost, participating in extracurricular activities allows students to develop important life skills that will serve them well in the future. For example, joining a sports team can help students develop teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Similarly, participating in a club or after school activity can help students develop their interests and passions, as well as learn valuable organizational skills.

In addition to these benefits, participation in extracurricular activities can also have a positive impact on a student's academic performance. Studies have shown that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have higher grades and test scores than those who do not. This is because participating in these activities can help students develop discipline, time management, and other skills that are essential for academic success.

However, there are also some potential cons to consider when it comes to student participation in extracurricular activities. For example, some students may not have the time or resources to participate in these activities due to other commitments such as family responsibilities or jobs. Additionally, some students may not have the physical or mental ability to participate in certain activities, which could lead to feelings of exclusion or disappointment.

Overall, while there are certainly some cons to consider, I believe that the benefits of student participation in extracurricular activities far outweigh the drawbacks. By providing students with opportunities to develop important life skills and improve their academic performance, we can help them become well-rounded, successful individuals who are prepared to take on the challenges of the future.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2

Introduction

Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society is undeniable. The United States is no exception, as technology has greatly influenced how people find jobs, shop, and communicate. In this essay, I will explore the positive effects of technology on people's lives in the United States.

Finding a Job

Technology has revolutionized the job search process. With the rise of online job boards and social media, job seekers can now easily search for job openings and apply directly from their computer or mobile device. This has made the job search process more efficient and accessible, allowing people to apply for jobs from anywhere at any time. Additionally, technology has enabled employers to streamline the hiring process by using tools such as video interviews and online assessments. This has made it easier for employers to find the right candidates and for job seekers to showcase their skills and qualifications.

Shopping

Technology has also made shopping more convenient and efficient. With the rise of e-commerce, people can now shop from the comfort of their own homes. Online shopping has eliminated the need to physically go to a store, saving time and money. Additionally, technology has enabled retailers to offer personalized shopping experiences, allowing customers to receive recommendations based on their purchase history and preferences. This has made shopping more enjoyable and efficient, and has helped retailers build stronger relationships with their customers.

Communication

Technology has also had a significant impact on communication. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, people can now easily stay in touch with friends and family from anywhere in the world. This has made communication more efficient and accessible, allowing people to stay connected with those who matter most. Additionally, technology has enabled businesses to communicate with their customers more effectively. With tools such as email and chatbots, businesses can quickly and efficiently respond to customer inquiries and concerns. This has improved customer satisfaction and loyalty, and has helped businesses build stronger relationships with their customers.

"When considering career choices for high school students, it is important to keep in mind the consequences of making the wrong choice and the benefits of exploring. Requiring students to decide on a career when they first enter high school can lead to many of them feeling overwhelmed, stressed out, and unprepared. Not only could this put them in a difficult position when it comes to choosing the right path, but it could also potentially lead to them making the wrong choice - one that might not be beneficial to them in the long run.

On the other hand, maturing and gaining knowledge about different careers before making a decision can be highly beneficial. Students who are able to explore their interests and learn more about potential career paths will be better equipped to make informed decisions when the time comes. They will be able to consider various options, weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each, and determine which ones are best suited to their individual skills and talents. This will give them the opportunity to build a career that is both meaningful and fulfilling.

In conclusion, there are many potential risks associated with requiring students to choose a career when they first enter high school. It is much better to allow students the chance to explore and learn more about different career paths before making a final decision. By doing so, they will be in a much better position to make an educated decision, one that is both beneficial and satisfying.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Attitude is a crucial aspect of life that can greatly impact our success. It refers to the way we think, feel and behave towards various situations and people. A positive attitude can help us overcome challenges, achieve our goals and build better relationships, while a negative attitude can lead to failure, disappointment and a host of other negative outcomes.

One of the most significant ways in which attitude affects our lives is through our ability to persevere. People with a positive attitude are more likely to face challenges with a sense of optimism and determination, which can help them overcome obstacles and continue working towards their goals. In contrast, those with a negative attitude may give up easily and lose motivation, which can lead to a lack of progress and ultimately, failure.

Another way in which attitude affects our lives is through our relationships with others. People with a positive attitude are more likely to be empathetic, understanding and supportive, which can help them build better relationships with friends, family and colleagues. On the other hand, those with a negative attitude may be more critical, judgmental and dismissive, which can lead to strained relationships and a lack of trust.

It is important to note that our attitude is not predetermined, but rather something that can be controlled and influenced by our thoughts, actions and choices. We can develop a positive attitude by focusing on the good things in life, practicing gratitude and reframing negative situations in a positive light. Additionally, we can control our attitude by being mindful of our thoughts and emotions and actively working to replace negative thoughts with positive ones.

In conclusion, a good attitude is essential to success in life. It can positively and negatively affect our ability to persevere, build relationships and achieve our goals. However, it is important to remember that our attitude is something that can be controlled and influenced by our thoughts, actions and choices. By developing a positive attitude and actively working to control it, we can improve our own lives and the lives of others.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Small acts of kindness can have a huge impact on someone's life. It doesn't take much to make a real difference in someone's day. A simple gesture of kindness, like a smile, can make even the most difficult situation a little brighter. If you hold a door open for someone, they appreciate the extra effort and kindness. These small acts of kindness can also be seen in larger behaviors. For example, spending time with an elderly neighbor, donating clothes to a homeless shelter or volunteering at a food pantry. Doing these activities can not only help those in the community, but can also be a source of fulfillment.

Even something as simple as helping someone carry groceries or letting someone go ahead of you in line can make an impact. Everyone is busy and can feel inundated with stress and responsibilities, so a small act of kindness can be a reminder that someone has taken the time to think of them. This gesture of kindness can help bring a smile to someone's face and make them feel supported.

In conclusion, small acts of kindness can have a big impact. These simple gestures are an easy way to show consideration and appreciation for those around you. Just remember, even a small act of kindness can go a long way.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my essay on the topic of starting a homework club:

Homework clubs have been a topic of discussion in many schools lately, and for good reason. They offer a great opportunity for students to get extra help with their homework, work together on projects, and build their teamwork and collaboration skills. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of starting a homework club, as well as the potential feelings of students and the consequences of implementing one.

One of the main advantages of a homework club is that it provides students with extra time and support to complete their homework. This can be especially helpful for students who struggle with certain subjects or who have a lot of homework due to various extracurricular activities. By working together in a club setting, students can help each other out and get their work done more efficiently. Additionally, homework clubs can help students develop important skills such as time management, organization, and responsibility.

Another advantage of homework clubs is that they can help to reduce stress and anxiety caused by excessive homework loads. Many students feel overwhelmed by the amount of homework they are given, and a homework club can provide a safe space for them to relax and focus on their work without feeling rushed or stressed. This can lead to improved academic performance and overall well-being.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider. One of the main concerns is that students may not want to attend a homework club after school. Many students value their free time and may not want to spend additional time at school working on homework. Additionally, some students may feel uncomfortable working in a group setting or may struggle to work independently.

Another potential disadvantage of homework clubs is that they may not be effective for all students. Some students may not need extra help with their homework, and a homework club may not provide enough support or structure for them. Additionally, homework clubs may not be suitable for students who have different learning styles or who require individualized attention.

In terms of the potential feelings of students about being asked to stay after school for a homework club, it's likely that some students will be enthusiastic",1,llama2_chat,0
"When it comes to making important decisions in life, seeking guidance from experts can be invaluable. It is important to research the various resources that are available, as experts can be especially helpful in assessing and navigating sensitive issues such as taxes, bills, and relationships. Taking the time to thoroughly explore the resources available and to learn more about how such experts can assist is a necessary step in finding the best-informed solutions. 

I have personally sought out expert advice in areas such as taxes and financial investments, and doing so has allowed me to make more well-informed decisions than I would have been able to reach on my own. Through this avenue, I also learned more about how a professional opinion can be just as valuable as an informed one. Utilizing the resources and advice of professionals can help you make better decisions, and ultimately help you achieve a more stable and secure lifestyle.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

"Positive attitude is a crucial aspect of success in different situations such as school, relationships, and difficult obstacles in life. A positive attitude can help individuals achieve their goals and overcome challenges that they may encounter. In this essay, I will analyze how having a positive attitude can lead to success in these situations and provide examples of people who have achieved success through positive thinking.

In school, having a positive attitude can help students perform better academically and achieve their goals. When students have a positive attitude towards learning, they are more motivated to study and complete their assignments. This, in turn, can lead to higher grades and better academic performance. Additionally, a positive attitude can help students build strong relationships with their teachers and classmates, which can lead to more opportunities and support in achieving their goals.

In relationships, having a positive attitude can help individuals build strong and healthy relationships. When individuals have a positive attitude towards their relationships, they are more likely to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts in a healthy manner, and build trust and intimacy with their partners. This, in turn, can lead to stronger and more fulfilling relationships.

In difficult obstacles in life, having a positive attitude can help individuals overcome challenges and achieve their goals. When individuals have a positive attitude towards life, they are more likely to see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. This, in turn, can help them develop resilience and perseverance, which are crucial skills for overcoming obstacles. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals build a strong support network of friends and family, which can provide emotional and practical support during difficult times.

There are many examples of people who have achieved success through positive thinking. One such example is Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Jobs was known for his positive attitude towards life and his ability to see challenges as opportunities for innovation. This, in turn, helped him build a successful company that revolutionized the technology industry.

Another example is Oprah Winfrey, a media mogul and philanthropist. Winfrey is known for her positive attitude towards life and her ability to inspire others through her talk show and book club. This, in turn, has helped her build a successful career and a loyal following of fans who look up to her as a role model.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude can lead to success in different situations such as school, relationships,",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Dear Principal [Last Name],

I am writing to advocate for policy number 1 concerning phone usage in class. I believe that allowing students to use their phones in class can have numerous benefits for students, including increased engagement and productivity, improved communication, and enhanced learning.

One of the main benefits of allowing students to use their phones in class is increased engagement and productivity. Many students find it difficult to stay focused during class, and allowing them to use their phones can help them stay engaged and focused. For example, students can use their phones to take notes, set reminders, and organize their schedules, which can help them stay on top of their work. Additionally, students can use their phones to access educational resources, such as online textbooks and study guides, which can help them learn more effectively.

Another benefit of allowing students to use their phones in class is improved communication. Many students find it difficult to communicate with their teachers and classmates, and allowing them to use their phones can help improve this. For example, students can use their phones to send messages or emails to their teachers, ask questions, or collaborate with their classmates on group projects. Additionally, students can use their phones to access social media platforms, which can help them stay connected with their classmates and teachers even outside of class.

Finally, allowing students to use their phones in class can enhance learning. Many students find it difficult to learn in a traditional classroom setting, and allowing them to use their phones can help them learn in a more interactive and engaging way. For example, students can use their phones to access educational videos, podcasts, and games, which can help them learn more effectively. Additionally, students can use their phones to access virtual reality and augmented reality experiences, which can help them visualize complex concepts and ideas.

In conclusion, I strongly advocate for policy number 1 concerning phone usage in class. I believe that allowing students to use their phones in class can have numerous benefits for students, including increased engagement and productivity, improved communication, and enhanced learning. I urge you to consider implementing this policy and giving students the opportunity to use their phones in a responsible and educational way.

Pushing Beyond Our Limits

Have you ever felt like you're stuck in a rut, like you're not reaching your full potential? I know I have. It's easy to get comfortable with what we know and what we're good at, but sometimes we need to push beyond our limits to grow and develop.

When we challenge ourselves to do things we're not used to, we learn new skills, gain confidence, and discover hidden talents. For example, I used to be really shy and introverted, but I decided to join the school play. It was scary at first, but with practice and determination, I was able to overcome my fears and perform in front of a big audience. I discovered that I had a talent for acting and it helped me become more outgoing and confident.

Moreover, pushing beyond our limits can help us develop resilience and perseverance. When we face challenges and obstacles, we learn to problem-solve and find ways to overcome them. This helps us become more resourceful and independent, which are important skills to have in life.

However, it's not always easy to push beyond our limits. It can be scary and uncomfortable, and we may feel like we're not good enough or smart enough. But the truth is, we are capable of more than we think. We just need to have the courage to try.

In conclusion, pushing beyond our limits is important for personal growth and development. It helps us discover new talents, gain confidence, and develop resilience. So, don't be afraid to take risks and challenge yourself. You never know what you're capable of until you try.",1,llama2_chat,1
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 

I totally agree with Einstein that imagination is more important than knowledge. Like, think about it, right? Knowledge is cool and all, but it's just facts and stuff. But imagination? That's where the real magic happens. 

I mean, without imagination, we wouldn't have things like...  ...video games! Can you imagine a world without Fortnite?! 😱 Nope, didn't think so. And what about movies?! Imagine if we couldn't dream up new worlds and characters... 🤯 It'd be so boring!

But, like, Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."" 💡🔥 That's deep, right? He's basically saying that imagination is the key to unlocking all the possibilities in life. And I'm like, 100% on board with that.

So, sure, knowledge is important too. But let's be real, it's not as fun as using our imaginations. Think about it, when we're bored, what do we do? We daydream or play pretend! 🙃 It's like, our brains are constantly coming up with new stories and ideas, even when we're not trying. And that's what makes life interesting, right?

Plus, imagine if we didn't have imagination?! We'd never come up with new inventions or innovations! 💡🔥 Like, can you imagine a world without smartphones?! 😱 It's just too much to handle.

So, in conclusion, imagination is way more important than knowledge. It's what makes life exciting and full of possibilities. And, like, Einstein said, it's the key to unlocking all the magic in the world. 🔥💫 Thanks for reading, Mrs. Johnson! 😊",1,llama2_chat,1
"As an 8th grader, I believe that changing school lunch to a healthier option is a great idea. However, it's important to consider the potential effects of this change on students with different religions, races, and body types.

One of the main pros of changing school lunch to a healthier option is that it can improve the overall health and well-being of students. A healthier lunch can provide students with the nutrients and energy they need to focus and learn in class. This can lead to better academic performance and a more productive school day. Additionally, a healthier lunch can help reduce the risk of obesity and other health problems that are common among children and teenagers.

However, there are also some cons to consider. Some students may have religious or cultural dietary restrictions that make it difficult for them to eat certain foods. For example, Muslim students may not be able to eat foods that contain pork or beef, while vegetarian students may not be able to eat foods that contain meat. It's important to ensure that these students are able to eat healthily in the cafeteria without feeling excluded or uncomfortable.

Another potential con is that some students may have different body types that require different types of food. For example, students who are more active may need more protein and carbohydrates to fuel their bodies, while students who are less active may need fewer calories and more fruits and vegetables. It's important to offer a variety of food options that cater to different body types and dietary needs.

One possible solution to ensuring that all students are able to eat healthily in the cafeteria is to offer food from around the world. This can provide students with a variety of options that cater to different cultural and religious dietary restrictions. For example, students who are Muslim can eat halal food, while students who are vegetarian can eat plant-based meals. Additionally, offering food from different cultures can provide students with a taste of diversity and expose them to new flavors and ingredients.

In conclusion, changing school lunch to a healthier option is a great idea, but it's important to consider the potential effects of this change on students with different religions, races, and body",1,llama2_chat,1
"Hey there!  Today, I'm gonna write about why extending the school day by one and a half hours would be super beneficial for both students and teachers. 

First off, let's talk about the students. An extra one and a half hours in school means we can learn more stuff!  Like, imagine having more time to explore science experiments, or learn a new language, or even get extra help with math problems that are giving us trouble.  It's like, we'd have more time to discover new things and expand our knowledge! 

But it's not just about learning more stuff, it's also about having more time to be creative!  Like, we could have more time to work on art projects, or write stories, or even make videos!  It's like, our minds would be able to wander and explore new ideas without feeling rushed. 

And let's not forget about the teachers!  They would love having more time to help us learn and grow!  They could give us more individual attention, or work with us on projects, or even just have more time to explain things to us.  It's like, they'd have more time to be there for us and make sure we're understanding the material. 

Plus, having more time in school means we'd have more time to socialize and make new friends!  Like, we could hang out with our classmates during breaks, or even start clubs or groups that interest us!  It's like, we'd have more time to connect with each other and build relationships. 

In conclusion, extending the school day by one and a half hours would be super beneficial for both students and teachers!  It would give us more time to learn, be creative, and connect with each other.  So, let's hope our school considers this idea!  Thanks for reading!",1,llama2_chat,4

But, like, mistakes aren't just for learning how to ride a bike. They can be for, like, anything!  You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things don't go right, but that's okay! It's like, an opportunity to learn what went wrong and how to fix it! 

And, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff. Sometimes you might make a mistake, but if you don't get discouraged, you can learn from it and get better! 

So, like, the next time you make a mistake, don't be all, like, ""Oh no, I'm a total failure!""  Instead, be all, like, ""Okay, what can I learn from this? How can I improve?""

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the pros and cons of committing to a job at a young age as an average 8th grade student:

As an 8th grader, I've often wondered about the pros and cons of committing to a job at a young age. Some people say that it's great to get a job early on in life, while others argue that it can have negative effects on your education and overall well-being. In this essay, I'll discuss both sides of the argument and share my own thoughts on the matter.

One of the main pros of committing to a job at a young age is that it can teach you valuable skills and responsibilities. When I think about it, my mom has always worked hard to provide for our family, and I admire how she manages to balance her job and family life. If I were to get a job, I'd learn how to be more responsible and independent, which could help me become a better person in the long run. Plus, having a job can give you a sense of purpose and motivation, which can be beneficial for your mental health.

However, there are also some cons to consider. For one, committing to a job at a young age can take away from your education. If you're working too many hours, you might not have enough time to focus on your schoolwork, which could negatively impact your grades. This could lead to a vicious cycle where you struggle in school, which in turn makes it harder to get a good job in the future. Additionally, working too young can also lead to burnout and stress, which can affect your mental health in the long run.

Personally, I think the pros and cons of committing to a job at a young age depend on the individual. If you're responsible and can manage your time well, then getting a job might be a great experience for you. But if you're not careful, it could lead to negative consequences. For now, I plan to focus on my education and extracurricular activities, but I might consider getting a part-time job during the summer or on weekends when I'm a bit older.

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe attending school with the goal of pursuing a career has several advantages. In this essay, I will explore the perspective of both high school students and teachers on the benefits of having a career while still in high school. Additionally, I will identify potential positive outcomes of having a career with experience while still in high school.

Firstly, attending school with the goal of pursuing a career can help students gain valuable experience and skills. High school students can take advantage of internships, apprenticeships, and co-ops to gain practical experience in their desired field. This experience can help them make informed decisions about their future career path and give them a competitive edge when applying for college or entering the workforce.

Secondly, attending school with the goal of pursuing a career can provide students with a sense of purpose and direction. High school students can use their education to explore their interests and passions, and gain the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue their desired career. This sense of purpose can help students stay motivated and focused on their goals, leading to better academic performance and personal growth.

From the perspective of teachers, attending school with the goal of pursuing a career can also have several benefits. Teachers can use their experience to provide students with valuable insights and advice on how to succeed in their desired field. Additionally, teachers can use their connections and networks to provide students with opportunities for internships, apprenticeships, and co-ops.

Furthermore, attending school with the goal of pursuing a career can also provide students with a sense of community and support. High school students can connect with their peers who share their interests and goals, forming a supportive network that can help them navigate the challenges of pursuing a career. Additionally, teachers can provide guidance and support to help students overcome any obstacles they may face.

"Hey, so like, I know some people might think that in-class learning is the only way to go, but let me tell you, distance learning is way better. I mean, think about it, you can learn from the comfort of your own home, or even while traveling! It's like, so much more convenient than having to go to a physical class every day.

First of all, distance learning is way more flexible. You can learn at your own pace, so if you need to take a break or revisit something, you can do that without feeling like you're falling behind. And with traditional in-class learning, you have to keep up with the teacher and the other students, which can be super stressful. But with distance learning, you can take breaks whenever you want and come back to it when you're ready. It's like, so much more relaxed.

Another thing is that distance learning is way more personalized. With traditional in-class learning, the teacher has to teach to the middle, so a lot of times, you might be learning stuff that you don't really need or want to know. But with distance learning, you can choose what you want to learn, and you can focus on the things that are most important to you. It's like, so much more tailored to your needs.

And let's not forget about the cost. Traditional in-class learning can be super expensive, especially if you have to pay for books and transportation. But with distance learning, you can access all the materials you need online, so it's way cheaper. It's like, so much more affordable.

However, some students may struggle to keep up, or might be overwhelmed when faced with a more rigorous curriculum. 

The impact of an advanced learning experience on human society continues to be felt, as students who are able to gain a wealth of knowledge before making their way through college are better prepared and equipped to make their mark on the world. Pre-AP classes can help open the door to success, as they bring the possibility of obtaining scholarships and other awards. With hard work, dedication, and a commitment to their studies, these students can reach heights beyond their peers.

"Homeschooling vs. Traditional Schooling: Which is Right for You?

As an eighth-grader, I have heard a lot of debate about whether homeschooling or traditional schooling is the best option for education. While there are pros and cons to both, ultimately, the decision depends on the individual and their family's needs and preferences.

One of the main advantages of homeschooling is the ability to tailor the curriculum to the student's learning style. Homeschooled students can learn at their own pace and focus on subjects that they find particularly challenging or interesting. Additionally, homeschooling provides a more personalized and individualized education experience. Teachers can provide one-on-one attention and support, which can be difficult to achieve in a traditional classroom setting.

On the other hand, attending a traditional school provides the opportunity to socialize with peers and participate in extracurricular activities. These experiences can help students develop important social and teamwork skills that are essential for success in the workplace and beyond. Additionally, traditional schools often offer a wider range of courses and programs than homeschools, which can provide students with more opportunities to explore their interests and talents.

Despite these advantages, homeschooling can be challenging for both the student and the parent. Homeschooling requires a significant amount of time and effort from the parent, who must serve as both teacher and administrator. Additionally, homeschooled students may miss out on the socialization opportunities and extracurricular activities that are available in traditional schools.

Attending a traditional school can also present its own challenges. Students may struggle to keep up with the pace of their peers or feel overwhelmed by the large class sizes. Additionally, traditional schools can be rigid and inflexible, which can make it difficult for students to pursue their individual interests and learning styles.

To be successful in a traditional school setting, parents can help their children in several ways. First, they can encourage their children to participate in extracurricular activities and join clubs or sports teams. This can help students develop important social and teamwork skills, as well as provide opportunities for personal growth and development.

Additionally, parents can help their children stay organized and on track with their assignments. This can involve setting aside dedicated study time, breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks, and",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Essay: Expressing Emotions, Feeling Shy, and Lack of Confidence

Emotions are a crucial part of our lives, and expressing them is essential for our well-being. However, sometimes it can be challenging to express our emotions, especially when we feel shy or uncomfortable. In my case, I often struggle to express my emotions, and it makes me feel shy and unconfident.

One instance when I felt this way was during a school project presentation. I was assigned to work with a group of classmates on a project, and we were supposed to present it in front of the class. As the presentation day approached, I started feeling nervous and anxious. I was afraid of speaking in front of my peers and making mistakes. My heart raced every time I thought about it, and I found myself avoiding the topic altogether.

On the day of the presentation, I was so nervous that I could barely speak. My voice trembled, and my words were slurred. I felt like I was going to throw up, and I couldn't believe how shy and unconfident I was being. After the presentation, I felt embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I couldn't help but wonder why I couldn't just be more confident and express my emotions more openly.

The reason why I struggle to express my emotions is because I'm not very good at trusting myself. I often doubt my abilities and feel like I'm not good enough. This lack of confidence makes it challenging for me to speak up and express my emotions. I feel like I need to be perfect and flawless, and when I'm not, I feel embarrassed and ashamed.

In conclusion, expressing emotions can be challenging, especially when we feel shy or unconfident. It's important to recognize that it's okay to feel this way and to work on building our confidence. By practicing and trusting ourselves, we can become better at expressing our emotions and feeling more comfortable in our own skin.",1,llama2_chat,2
"The school day is a crucial part of a student's academic and personal development. However, in recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether the school day should be longer or shorter. In this essay, I will analyze the consequences for students, teachers, and the school if the school board were to add additional hours to the school day.

On the one hand, adding more hours to the school day could have several benefits for students. Firstly, it could provide more time for students to learn and retain new information. Students could have more opportunities to ask questions and receive feedback from their teachers, which could lead to better academic performance. Additionally, students could have more time to engage in extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs, which could help them develop important social and leadership skills.

On the other hand, adding more hours to the school day could also have several negative consequences for students. Firstly, it could lead to increased stress and burnout. Students may feel overwhelmed by the increased workload and may struggle to balance their academic and personal responsibilities. Additionally, students may experience a decrease in their motivation and engagement in school, as they may feel that their time is being wasted.

Teachers could also be affected by the addition of more hours to the school day. While they may welcome the opportunity to provide more support and guidance to their students, they may also feel overwhelmed by the increased workload. Teachers may struggle to keep up with the demands of teaching and may experience a decrease in their job satisfaction.

The school itself could also face consequences if the school board were to add additional hours to the school day. The school may need to hire more teachers to cover the increased workload, which could be costly. Additionally, the school may need to invest in new resources and materials to support the additional teaching time, which could also be expensive.

In conclusion, the addition of more hours to the school day could have both positive and negative consequences for students, teachers, and the school. While it may provide more opportunities for learning and engagement, it could also lead to increased stress and burnout, and could be costly for the school. Therefore, it is important for the school board to carefully consider the potential consequences before making any decisions about the length of the school day.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"One's character traits are often strongly influenced by the people we communicate with and the environment in which we live. For example, growing up I had a close friend who was very outgoing and adventurous. Spending time with them often pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take on new challenges. Over time I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life. 

To illustrate this point, one of my relatives grew up in an environment where she was surrounded by art, music, and books. At a young age her parents exposed her to various forms of creative expression and provided her with the necessary resources and tools to be creative. As a result, she grew up to be very artistic and proficient in multiple instruments. This would have not been the case had she not been exposed to the various forms of art and creativity in her childhood. 

Overall, it is clear that one's character traits are often heavily influenced and formed by the people we communicate with and the environments in which we live.

When you put in the effort to achieve your goals, you are showing the world that you are dedicated and committed to your own success. This can be especially important in a world where many people are quick to judge others based on their appearance or achievements.

For example, when I was in middle school, I was always afraid to show my true self. I was afraid that my classmates would judge me for being different, so I tried to fit in as much as possible. But one day, I decided to take a stand and be myself. I started working hard on my schoolwork and my hobbies, and before I knew it, I had achieved a lot of success.

At first, I was afraid to share my accomplishments with my classmates, but as I started to see the positive impact that my hard work was having on my life, I realized that I had nothing to be afraid of. My classmates started to see me for who I really was, and they started to appreciate my unique qualities.

In the end, being myself and putting in hard work has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I have learned that it is okay to be different and that success comes from within. I have also learned that the people who truly matter in my life are the ones who appreciate me for who I am, not for what I have achieved.

In conclusion, it is important to be yourself and to put in hard work in order to demonstrate who you really are. By being true to yourself and working hard, you can achieve success and find happiness in your own unique way.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Taking classes from home has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially with the rise of technology. While there are many benefits to this approach, there are also some drawbacks that students should be aware of. In this essay, I will examine the benefits and drawbacks of taking classes from home from the perspectives of students who have done so.

One of the biggest benefits of taking classes from home is the flexibility it provides. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly helpful for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities. It also allows students to take classes that may not be available in their local area or that they may not have access to otherwise.

Another benefit of taking classes from home is the ability to learn from anywhere. Students can take classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be a more comfortable and relaxing environment. This can lead to better focus and retention of information. Additionally, students can take classes from anywhere in the world, which can broaden their perspective and expose them to different cultures and ideas.

However, there are also some drawbacks to taking classes from home. One of the biggest is the lack of interaction with other students and teachers. In a traditional classroom setting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and ask questions in real-time. This can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with learning on their own. Additionally, teachers can provide immediate feedback and guidance, which can be helpful for students who need it.

Another drawback of taking classes from home is the potential for distractions. When students are learning from home, they may be more likely to get distracted by social media, TV, or other activities. This can lead to a lack of focus and a decrease in the amount of time spent studying. Additionally, students may struggle with staying motivated and disciplined when they are not in a structured classroom environment.

In conclusion, taking classes from home has both benefits and drawbacks. While it provides flexibility and the ability to learn from anywhere, it can also lead to a lack of interaction with other students and teachers and potential distractions. It is important for students to weigh the pros and cons and decide if taking classes from home is the right choice for them.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that outdoor activities are an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. Not only do they provide numerous physical benefits, but they also offer numerous mental and emotional benefits. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of outdoor activities and how they can be enjoyable.

Firstly, outdoor activities provide numerous physical benefits. Exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy body, and outdoor activities provide a fun and engaging way to get moving. For example, hiking, biking, and swimming are all great ways to get a good workout while enjoying the fresh air and beautiful scenery. Not only do these activities improve physical health, but they also help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.

Secondly, outdoor activities offer numerous mental and emotional benefits. Spending time in nature has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Activities such as camping, fishing, and kayaking provide a chance to disconnect from technology and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. This time spent in nature allows individuals to reflect on their thoughts and feelings, providing a sense of calm and relaxation. Additionally, outdoor activities provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which can boost self-esteem and confidence.

Lastly, outdoor activities can be enjoyable. While exercise is important, it doesn't have to be a chore. Outdoor activities provide a fun and engaging way to get moving. For example, playing sports such as soccer or basketball with friends can be a great way to stay active while having fun. Additionally, outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and fishing provide a chance to explore new places and try new things. These experiences can be incredibly rewarding and enjoyable, providing lasting memories and experiences.

In conclusion, outdoor activities are an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. They provide numerous physical, mental, and emotional benefits, and can be enjoyable for people of all ages. As an eighth-grade student, I encourage my peers to get outside and enjoy all that nature has to offer. Whether it's going for a hike, playing a sport, or simply taking a walk in the park, there are countless ways to enjoy the great outdoors.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2

So, you know how sometimes you're like, ""Ugh, this school lunch is so gross,"" right?  Like, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love pizza and burgers and all that, but sometimes it's just like, can't we have something else for once? 

Anyway, turns out that having a healthier lunch menu can do way more than just make our lunches more interesting.  It can actually improve our diet, security, and lifestyle!  Like, think about it, when we eat healthier foods, we're more likely to have more energy, focus better in class, and even do better on tests!  It's like, the more fruits and veggies we eat, the smarter we get! 

And it's not just about us, either!  When we eat healthier, we're less likely to get sick, and we're more likely to have better overall health!  Like, did you know that kids who eat healthier are less likely to have obesity, diabetes, and other diseases?  It's true!

It's like, the more fruits and veggies we eat, the happier we are! 

And let's not forget about the economic benefits!  When we eat healthier, we're less likely to have to go to the doctor as much, which means less money spent on medical bills!  Plus, when we're healthier, we're more likely to be able to focus in class and do better in school,",1,llama2_chat,1
"Attending classes online provides a unique opportunity for those students who have family and job responsibilities. It gives students more flexibility to manage their time, allowing them to pursue their academic goals without compromising their other commitments. This type of learning environment also offers the potential for students to balance work and class easily, as they can access courses when and where they are most convenient. Additionally, students have the benefit of access to broader course offerings, since online classes often take place in virtual classrooms which can be located anywhere in the world. Finally, it can be a cost-effective way of learning, since online instruction can be more affordable than traditional classes. Thus, attending classes online can offer great benefits for students who must juggle family, work, and academic responsibilities.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"After reviewing several studies on the pros and cons of requiring students to do community service, it appears that the primary concern is the potential impact on academic performance. The students may be so focused on completing the service requirements that they neglect to focus enough time and energy on their studies. However, community service can also teach valuable life lessons such as compassion, empathy, collaboration, and communication, which can have a positive effect on academic performance.  

A potential solution to this issue would be to allow students to choose the type and amount of community service they take part in. By allowing students to customize their service, they can optimize their time to ensure both their academic and personal needs are met. Additionally, this solution would empower students to serve their community in a way that suits their interests and passions. Finally, the government should provide incentives for students who choose to do community service beyond the required minimum, such as scholarship and volunteer awards. By formulating this solution, students, community, and government can all benefit.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey there!  So, I reckon the whole ""attending classes in person vs. from home"" thing is a pretty interesting topic, ya know? Like, I know some people who are all about the in-person thing, but then there are others who are more into the online/video thing. And, like, I gotta say, I can see both sides of the coin, ya know?

So, let's start with the pros of attending classes in person.  First off, it's just, like, way more interactive, ya know? You get to, like, see your teacher's face and stuff, and you can ask 'em questions and stuff. Plus, you get to, like, connect with your classmates and stuff, which can be pretty cool. And, like, you can just, like, ask your teacher for help in person, ya know? It's way easier than trying to, like, message 'em online or something.

But, like, there are also some cons to attending classes in person, ya know?  For one thing, it can be, like, super time-consuming, especially if you have to, like, commute or something. And, like, sometimes it can be hard to focus in class if you're, like, sitting in a room full of people, ya know? Plus, like, sometimes you might get distracted by, like, other stuff going on in the classroom, like if someone's being loud or something.

Now, let's talk about the pros of using online/video resources for classes.  First off, it's just, like, way more convenient, ya know? You can, like, learn from the comfort of your own home, or wherever you want, really. And, like, you can rewind or pause the video if you need to, which can be, like, super helpful if you missed something or need to take a break or something. Plus, like, you can, like, learn at your own pace, which can be pretty cool if you're, like, a fast learner or something.

"In today's fast-paced world, education is a crucial aspect of our lives. It helps us develop the necessary skills to succeed in our personal and professional lives. However, the traditional classroom setting can be limiting in terms of the opportunities for learning and growth. One way to address this issue is by pairing older students with younger students in a school setting. This practice has numerous benefits that can enhance the learning experience for both students. In this essay, I will explore four ways that pairing older students with younger students can be beneficial.

Firstly, pairing older students with younger students can provide mentorship opportunities. Older students can offer guidance and support to younger students in a variety of areas, including academic subjects, social skills, and personal development. For example, an older student who excels in a particular subject can provide one-on-one tutoring to a younger student who is struggling in that area. This type of mentorship can be invaluable in helping younger students develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed academically.

Secondly, pairing older students with younger students can promote intergenerational learning. When older and younger students work together, they can share their knowledge and experiences with each other. This type of learning can be particularly effective in subjects that require real-world examples and perspectives, such as history or social studies. By working together, older and younger students can gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and develop a greater appreciation for different perspectives.

Thirdly, pairing older students with younger students can foster a sense of community and belonging. When students work together in pairs or small groups, they are more likely to develop strong relationships with their peers. These relationships can provide emotional support and a sense of belonging, which can be particularly important for younger students who may be new to the school or struggling to make friends. By pairing older and younger students, schools can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.

Finally, pairing older students with younger students can improve academic achievement. Research has shown that pairing students of different ages can lead to improved academic performance. For example, a study conducted by the University of Washington found that students who worked in pairs with older peers performed better on standardized tests than those who worked in pairs with younger peers. This is likely due to the fact that older peers can provide more guidance and support to younger peers, helping them to develop the",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"When people feel the need to always be working, they can easily become overwhelmed and suffer from burnout. Taking breaks not only provides a physical and mental respite, but can also lead to a more positive outcome for the quality of one's work. Breaks allow for moments of quiet contemplation and reflection, helping to fuel creativity. They can also help to reduce stress levels and improve concentration.

On a personal level, I can attest that taking breaks can be a great support in an always-working mentality. I often take breaks during the day to distract myself from the work, allowing me to come back with a renewed clarity and focus. I find that not only do I work more efficiently, but I also have more solutions and ideas for the tasks and projects that I am working on. Overall, committing to taking breaks on a regular basis not only allows for increased focus and productivity, but also adds to improved physical and mental health.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Taking advice from others can have a significant impact on our life decisions. Whether it comes from a mentor, parent, or guardian, advice can provide valuable guidance and help us navigate the challenges we face. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of advice, analyze an example of how it can make a difference, compare it to trying different types of food from different chefs, and explain how it can lead to a more successful and hardworking mindset.

Firstly, advice is an essential part of our lives. It can provide us with the knowledge and skills we need to make informed decisions and achieve our goals. Whether it's advice on how to study for an exam, how to handle a difficult situation at work, or how to manage our finances, taking advice from those who have experience and expertise can be invaluable.

One example of the power of advice is Abraham Lincoln's decision to end slavery. Lincoln sought advice from many people, including his mentor, Stephen Douglas, and his wife, Mary Todd, before making this historic decision. Their guidance helped him to understand the moral and political implications of ending slavery and ultimately led him to take action. Without their advice, Lincoln may not have had the courage or the knowledge to make such a significant and impactful decision.

Advice can also be compared to trying different types of food from different chefs. Just as trying new and different foods can broaden our palates and help us discover new flavors and cuisines, seeking out advice from a variety of sources can help us develop a more diverse and nuanced understanding of the world. Whether it's advice from a mentor, a colleague, or a friend, taking the time to listen and learn from others can help us grow and develop as individuals.

Finally, advice can lead to a more successful and hardworking mindset. When we seek out advice and take it to heart, we are more likely to approach challenges with a growth mindset. This means that we view failure as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than as a setback. By seeking out advice and taking it seriously, we are more likely to be proactive, persistent, and resilient in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, taking advice from others can have a significant impact on our life decisions. Whether it's advice from a mentor, parent, or guardian, seeking out",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Hey there! As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to dive into this essay prompt and share my thoughts on the difference between off-campus and on-campus education.

First off, let's talk about online education. I think it's pretty cool that we can learn from the comfort of our own homes! It's like having a personalized learning experience without having to leave our pajamas. 😴 But, I've heard that online education can be kinda tricky when it comes to staying focused. Like, how can we avoid getting distracted by our favorite Netflix shows or video games? 😅 It's like, super easy to get sucked into a scroll fest on TikTok when we should be learning! 😳

Now, let's talk about homeschooling. I know some kids who are homeschooled, and they seem to really enjoy it. They get to learn at their own pace, and they don't have to deal with the craziness of a school classroom. 😅 But, I've also heard that homeschooling can be kinda lonely. Like, what if we don't get to hang out with our friends or make new ones? 🤷‍♀️ It's important to have social interactions and learn from others, right?

Video conference classes are pretty cool too! I've taken a few online classes, and it's like being in a real classroom but from the comfort of our own homes. 😊 We can still see and hear the teacher and interact with our classmates, but we don't have to physically be there. It's like having the best of both worlds! 🤩

But, let's talk about the potential for cheating and distraction. I think it's way easier to cheat when we're learning off-campus. Like, how can we avoid looking at our phones or checking our social media when we're supposed to be learning? 😔 It's way harder to focus when we're not in a traditional classroom setting.

And finally, let's talk about socialization. I",1,llama2_chat,2
"Upon graduating high school, students are often faced with many potential career paths. One of the most popular post-secondary routes is to go to college to pursue further studies in a given field of interest. This can provide job opportunities in a variety of fields, such as accounting, engineering, and law. The benefits to this include the potential for higher salary prospects, greater job security, and the experience of pursuing more specialized training. On the flip side, there is also the financial commitment and technical aptitude required to complete some of these courses.

Alternately, students can take on an apprenticeship in order to receive on-the-job training in a desired field. This pathway provides the student with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience alongside more experienced professionals and a potential salary while doing so. The potential downsides to this approach are the initially lower wages compared to those of university graduates, and some jobs in this field may be harder to secure and stability may be lower in comparison. 

It is important to ensure that students have access to a variety of career choices in order to assist them in making an informed decision. Schools should provide guidance to students in order to ensure they are educated on the various job opportunities available to them. It is important for students to attend school in order to gain a good education which can help them to achieve future success. With the right combination of post-secondary studies and on-the-job training, students can be encouraged to strive for a successful career.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As a teenager, I believe that a curfew of 10 p.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends would have both positive and negative implications on our freedom, safety, and well-being. While it would provide a sense of security and allow for more sleep, it would also limit our opportunities for constructive leisure activities and erode parental trust and respect.

On one hand, a curfew would increase public safety by limiting the number of young people on the streets at night. This would reduce the likelihood of accidents, crimes, and other dangerous situations. Additionally, it would give teenagers more time to focus on their studies and prepare for exams, which could lead to better academic performance and a brighter future.

On the other hand, a curfew would limit the opportunities for constructive leisure activities, such as volunteering, attending cultural events, or pursuing hobbies. This could lead to a lack of engagement and a sense of boredom, which could ultimately lead to negative behavior such as substance abuse or risky behavior.

Moreover, a curfew would erode parental trust and respect, as teenagers would be seen as irresponsible and untrustworthy. This could lead to a breakdown in communication and a lack of support, which could have long-term negative effects on their mental health and well-being.

In conclusion, while a curfew may provide a sense of security and allow for more sleep, it would also limit opportunities for constructive leisure activities and erode parental trust and respect. As such, it is important for parents to consider alternative solutions, such as providing opportunities for supervised leisure activities or setting clear expectations and consequences for behavior. Ultimately, the well-being of teenagers should be the top priority, and any curfew should be implemented in a way that promotes their safety, freedom, and well-being.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Making our own decisions is a fundamental aspect of our lives. It is the process of weighing the pros and cons of different options and ultimately choosing the one that we believe is best for us. In this essay, I will argue that people should make their own decisions and how doing so can give them more freedom.

Firstly, making our own decisions allows us to take responsibility for our choices. When we make a decision, we are accountable for the outcome. This means that we must take ownership of our actions and the consequences that come with them. It is easy to blame others when things don't go our way, but when we make our own decisions, we are in control of our destiny. This sense of ownership and control can be empowering and can lead to greater self-confidence and self-esteem.

Secondly, making our own decisions can give us more freedom. When we rely on others to make decisions for us, we are essentially giving up our autonomy. We are not free to make choices that align with our values and beliefs. This can lead to a sense of suffocation and lack of control over our lives. On the other hand, when we make our own decisions, we have the freedom to choose what we believe is best for us, regardless of what others may think. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and happiness.

Lastly, making our own decisions can lead to better outcomes. When we make decisions based on our own values and beliefs, we are more likely to be satisfied with the results. This is because we are making choices that align with our own goals and aspirations. On the other hand, when we make decisions based on what others want for us, we may not be happy with the outcome, even if it is what others consider to be the ""best"" decision. This can lead to a sense of dissatisfaction and regret.

In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because it allows them to take responsibility for their choices, gives them more freedom, and leads to better outcomes. When we make our own decisions, we are in control of our destiny and can choose what we believe is best for us. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and happiness.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"The first experiment was conducted on the interior of a frog. We examined the heart rate of the frog before and after stimulation of its legs with a paintbrush. We found that the heart rate of the frog increased once stimulation was applied. This gives evidence to show that the movements of the legs are related to stimulation of the heart.

The second experiment involved using a flashlight and a liquid. When the flashlight was shone onto the liquid, the liquid glowed in a specific color. This was because the liquid had a property called fluorescence which made it glow in response to the light. This showed that depending on the type of liquid, different colors could be observed when a light is shone onto it.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American essayist, philosopher, and poet who lived in the 19th century. He is known for his advocacy of individualism and self-reliance. One of his most famous quotes is ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote reflects Emerson's belief in the importance of being true to oneself and not conforming to societal expectations.

Being oneself is significant because it allows individuals to live authentically and to express their true selves. When people try to become someone else, they often lose touch with their own values and beliefs, and may even compromise their integrity. This can lead to feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction with life.

Trying to become someone else to get a job can be unsuccessful because employers value authenticity and individuality. They want to hire people who are passionate about their work and who bring something unique to the table. When people try to fit into a mold or conform to someone else's expectations, they may not be able to show their true potential or stand out from the competition.

Some people value material goods over important values, such as authenticity and self-expression. This can lead to a culture that places too much emphasis on conformity and not enough on individuality. Emerson believed that this was a dangerous trend, and that people should prioritize their own values and beliefs above all else.

Life is short, and it is important to live it authentically. When we try to become someone else, we may lose sight of what truly matters in life. Emerson's message to live authentically and to be true to oneself is still relevant today, and is a reminder to prioritize our own values and beliefs above all else.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As an 8th grade student, I have to say that technology has had a huge impact on our lives. It's like, everywhere you go, people are glued to their phones or tablets, and it's like, hard to imagine life without them now. Like, my mom is always on her phone when she's cooking or watching TV, and my dad is always on his laptop when he's working from home. It's like, they can't put their phones down for a minute!

Anyway, so I did some research on how technology has affected people's lives, and I found some really cool things. Like, did you know that technology has made it so much easier for disabled people to communicate and access information? There are like, special apps and software that can help them type or speak, and it's really cool. And for busy people, there are like, online shopping and researching tools that make it so much faster and easier to get things done. It's like, no more running to the store or library to do research, you can just do it all online!

But technology isn't just useful for everyday life, it can also be used in emergency situations. Like, during natural disasters, technology can help people communicate with each other and get help. And in the military, technology has come a long way. There are like, drones and other cool gadgets that can help soldiers do their jobs better and safer. It's like, technology has really improved over the years!

But some people say that technology promotes laziness. Like, they think that because we can do so much online, we're not exercising our brains as much as we used to. But I don't think that's true. I mean, sure, we might not have to walk to the library to do research, but that doesn't mean we're not learning anything. And besides, technology can also help us learn new things and explore new ideas. It's like, it's not just a distraction, it can also be a tool for learning!

So overall, I think technology has had a really positive impact on our lives. It's like, it's changed the way we communicate and access information, and it's made it",1,llama2_chat,0
"Living an active lifestyle is incredibly important for both individuals and societies alike. Physically active individuals have stronger physical and mental health, increased longevity, and exhibit personality traits linked to higher levels of well-being. For societies, physical activity reduces healthcare costs associated with chronic diseases, and increases productivity. 

For individuals, an active lifestyle can help to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, improve mental health, reduce anxiety and depression, and improve overall quality of life. Studies have shown that physical activity can also help to boost mood, increase self-esteem, and increase energy level. Regular aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health and lowers blood pressure, and resistance training helps to build strength and muscular endurance. 

At the societal level, physical activity reduces healthcare costs associated with chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Exercise also boosts productivity, as it helps to reduce the number of days missed from work due to illness or injury, as well as reduces the cost of employee healthcare. Active individuals also contribute to a healthier and more productive environment, as they are more likely to engage in activities such as volunteering, and have involvement in their community. 

It is clear that living an active lifestyle is important for both individuals and society, and that the benefits of engaging in regular physical activity are vast. We should all strive to add more activity into our daily lives in order to reap the countless physical, mental, and social benefits.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

For example, research has shown that a person's upbringing has an important role in shaping their understanding of the world and the behavior they accept as normal. Additionally, external events like death, physical illness or injury, and even day-to-day decisions can cause dramatic behavioral changes. It is important for individuals to become aware of how their life experiences have influenced them, so they can take control of their own lives and use the hardships they have gone through to become stronger. By consciously making decisions with an awareness of our own individual experiences, we are better able to weigh our options and make decisions that are in our best interest. Taking ownership of our lives and learning from the hardships life throws our way can ultimately help us become more resilient and better equipped to handle future challenges.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Technology has become an integral part of modern living, and it is difficult to ignore the multitude of ways it has improved our lives. People who are physically limited by their lack of mobility, speech, or hearing can now access communication, information, and services without the limitations of a physical world. Online shopping, for instance, provides an immense convenience that wasn’t available before; buying a book without leaving your house is now a reality. Furthermore, technology has enabled us to connect with people from around the world, allowing us to communicate with near-instantaneous speed. 

Although technology has brought about great strides in our lives, it is important to consider the downsides of this progression. With more communication and information readily available, the value of human contact can be lessened. Face-to-face conversations are becoming more scarce, and the consequences of this could be severe. It is important to learn how to properly utilize technology and its features so that human contact and communication are not lost. 

Ultimately, there is little argument against the fact that technology has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on both our personal and professional lives. It enables us to communicate across long distances in mere seconds and has made the world feel ever-so-slightly smaller. However, it is important to recognize the danger of overreliance and remember that technology is a resource and a tool — one that should be used intelligently and with consideration for its consequences.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"One of the best ways to grow and learn is to try something new. Trying a new activity can be challenging, but the rewards that come with taking a risk can be invaluable. In this essay, we'll explore the pros and cons of trying something new and provide some tips to help readers succeed. 

The primary benefit of trying something new is the knowledge and skills you gain from the experience. Whether it's learning a new language or trying a new sport, venturing out of your comfort zone can help you to develop valuable skills and maximize your potential. Additionally, trying something new can open you up to a whole world of social opportunities, whether that's making new friends or networking with like-minded individuals. 

On the other hand, there are also some drawbacks to trying something new. For instance, it can be intimidating to venture into a new space that you're unfamiliar with, such as a hobby or activity that you've never pursued before. Additionally, there is the risk of failure if you are unable to learn or master the activity. And of course, depending on the activity, there may be financial costs associated with pursuing a new endeavor. 

Fortunately, there are some tips that can help readers succeed when trying something new. First, set realistic goals and don't be afraid to ask for help. Take small steps and celebrate the victories you make along the way. Be patient—learning a new skill or activity takes time, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Finally, keep an open mind and allow yourself to enjoy the process! 

In conclusion, trying something new can open you up to a world of possibilities and provide valuable knowledge and skills. While it can be intimidating and there is always a risk of failure, taking small steps and keeping an open mind can help readers succeed in their new endeavors.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey there! 

So, I know some people might be thinking, ""Ugh, a longer school day? No way, man! That's like, way too long!"" But hear me out. 

I think having a longer school day could be really beneficial for high school students. Like, think about it. We're already in school for like, eight hours a day, but sometimes it feels like we're not getting enough time to learn everything we need to know.  I mean, have you seen some of these kids' faces when they're trying to learn new stuff? It's like they're trying to drink from a firehose! 

So, if we had more time in school, we could actually learn more stuff. Like, imagine being able to get more help from teachers, or having more time to work on projects and stuff. It could be really great for our grades and stuff.  And who doesn't want better grades, right? 

But, I know some people might be thinking, ""But won't it be super annoying to be in school for longer? Like, won't we just be sitting around all day?"" And yeah, I get that.  But, think about it this way: if we have more time in school, we could actually have more fun. Like, imagine being able to play games or do cool projects during class. It could be like, a nice break from the usual boring stuff. 

And, I don't know about you guys, but I feel like I'm always forgetting stuff.  Like, I'll be in class and I'll be like, ""Oh no, I forgot to do that homework!"" Or, ""I forgot to study for that test!"" And it's just,  super frustrating. But, if we had more time in school, maybe we could actually remember stuff better. 

But, I guess there are some downsides too.  Like, some people might be like, ""Ugh, I don't want to be",1,llama2_chat,3
"Over the last two decades, technology has drastically changed the way humans interact. As we increasingly rely on our devices and the internet for communication and entertainment, human contact and the way in which we build meaningful relationships have been greatly affected. 

One of the main consequences of our overusage of technology is the rise of bad communication skills. Our devices allow us to access almost the entirety of the world's knowledge in an instant, but all too many people find themselves lacking in emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. Without regular real life interactions, people are struggling to use proper manners and interact with one another in a meaningful way. 

Another effect is the potential rise in health problems due to a lack of physical contact and inactivity. Spending more time on our devices has caused people to prioritize virtual contact over physical contact - thus depriving individuals from the physical and mental benefits of physical contact. In addition, people are also playing fewer outdoor activities or taking leisurely walks, which decrease physical activity and leads to a decrease in overall health and wellbeing. 

Finally, the amount of time people are spending on their devices has led to people living in an increasingly inactive lifestyle. As technology has allowed us to access our work, study and entertainment needs from the comfort of our homes, people are more likely to stay indoors rather than go outdoors for leisure activities or stay in touch with their respective communities.

Overall, the effects of technology in our daily lives are far reaching, with some of the most prominent being bad communication skills, health problems, and inactivity. It is important that we remain mindful of our technology consumption and ensure that it does not become an unhealthy lifestyle.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey, I'm totally stoked you're asking me to write an essay on this super important topic! 

So, here's my take on whether or not cell phones should be allowed in the classroom. 

I think it's totally reasonable to allow cell phones in class, like, sometimes. I mean, let's be real, they're super useful for stuff like looking up stuff for a project, or checking the time, or even just sending a quick text to a friend who's sitting next to you. 

But, like, sometimes I think teachers get all worked up about it, and they're like, ""No phones in class, period!"" And I'm like, ""Uh, hello? Did you know that like, 90% of students have cell phones? It's not even fair to expect us to not use them at all!"" 

And don't even get me started on the whole ""distraction"" thing. I mean, sure, maybe if you're in a super boring class, like, yeah, maybe looking at your phone for a sec can be a distraction. But like, if you're in a class that's actually interesting, you're not gonna be on your phone the whole time. 

Plus, think about it. If we're allowed to use our phones in class, we can actually learn how to use them responsibly. Like, we can learn how to take notes on them, or even use them to look up stuff for our projects. It's like, a win-win situation! 

So yeah, in conclusion, I think it's totally reasonable to allow cell phones in class sometimes. It's not like we're gonna be on them the whole time, and it could actually help us learn how to use them responsibly.  Thanks for reading my essay!",1,llama2_chat,2
"Business management is a complex field that requires a wide range of skills and knowledge. There are many different types of business management, each with its own unique set of responsibilities and challenges. In this essay, we will explore some of the most common types of business management and discuss the pressures and complexities associated with each. We will also analyze different approaches to managing business operations and reflect on the importance of responsibility and commitment in business management.

One of the most common types of business management is financial management. Financial managers are responsible for managing the financial resources of a business, including budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting. They must ensure that the business has enough cash flow to cover its expenses and invest in growth opportunities. Financial managers must also be able to analyze financial data and make informed decisions about how to allocate resources.

Another important type of business management is operational management. Operational managers are responsible for ensuring that a business runs smoothly and efficiently. They must manage the day-to-day operations of the business, including production, logistics, and supply chain management. Operational managers must be able to optimize processes and reduce costs while maintaining quality and customer satisfaction.

Marketing management is another important type of business management. Marketing managers are responsible for developing and implementing marketing strategies that will help the business attract and retain customers. They must be able to analyze market trends and consumer behavior and use this information to develop effective marketing campaigns. Marketing managers must also be able to manage budgets and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.

Human resource management is another important type of business management. Human resource managers are responsible for managing the people within a business, including hiring, training, and performance management. They must ensure that the business has a motivated and productive workforce that is aligned with the company's goals and objectives. Human resource managers must also be able to manage employee relations and address any issues that may arise.

Business managers often face a range of pressures and complexities in their work. These may include financial pressures, such as managing cash flow and meeting financial targets. They may also face operational pressures, such as managing supply chains and meeting production deadlines. Business managers must be able to adapt to changing market conditions and respond quickly to new challenges.

Different approaches to managing business operations can be effective in different situations. For example, some businesses may benefit from a more traditional, hierarchical approach to management,",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Winston Churchill famously said that ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This is a profound statement that speaks to the importance of not letting failure stand in the way of achieving your ultimate success. Failure is a natural part of life; no one accomplishes their goals with initial success alone. It is by learning from our mistakes that we can become better and progress towards success. 

In particular, it is the courage to persist through the failures that will ultimately drive lasting success. Churchill serves as a powerful example of this idea, as his tenacity through his failures enabled him to ultimately become one of the greatest statesmen in history. He was able to persist through difficult times of failure and ultimately achieved great success because of his determination and courage to continue. 

In short, failures do not necessarily indicate a lack of success; rather, they should be viewed as an important stepping stone on the way to success. Through the courage to not give up in the face of failures, success can be achieved.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Perseverance plays an important role in achieving our goals. It is the ability to stick to a plan and continue to move toward a desired outcome despite any obstacles and impediments that may arise. It is easy to give up when faced with a difficult task, but peristence allows us to see the journey through to the end. However, it is important to recognize that success is not always guaranteed. Family support is another key component of achieving our goals. Having the support of family can provide comfort and encouragement to keep going, even when times get tough. But, it is important to consider that family support can be both beneficial and detrimental to success. When mistakes are made, it is important to understand the difference between successes and failures. While it may be tempting to give up after a setback, it is important to learn from the mistakes and use them to make adjustments for the future. It is only through successes and failures that we can develop and grow as individuals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"The life and ideas of Ralph Waldo Emerson

Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American essayist, philosopher, and poet who lived in the 19th century. He is best known for his essays, which often focused on individualism, self-reliance, and the importance of living a life of purpose. Emerson believed that people should strive to be true to themselves and their own beliefs, rather than conforming to societal norms or expectations.

Benefits of challenging yourself with new tasks

One of the most important things we can do for ourselves is to challenge ourselves with new tasks. By taking on new challenges, we can push ourselves to grow and develop in ways that we might not have thought possible. This can be especially beneficial when it comes to personal growth and self-improvement.

Taking risks in order to gain knowledge and experience

Taking risks is an essential part of gaining knowledge and experience. By stepping out of our comfort zones and trying new things, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us. This can be especially important when it comes to pursuing our passions and interests.

Benefits of trying new things versus staying comfortable in life

There are many benefits to trying new things versus staying comfortable in life. For one, trying new things can help us discover new interests and passions that we might not have known about otherwise. Additionally, taking on new challenges can help us develop new skills and abilities that can be applied in a variety of different contexts.

How having new experiences can help shape a better future

Having new experiences can be incredibly beneficial for our personal growth and development. By stepping out of our comfort zones and trying new things, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us. This can help us make more informed decisions about our lives and can ultimately lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful existence.

Consequences of not challenging yourself or attempting to master something

If we don't challenge ourselves or attempt to master something, we risk stagnating and not growing as individuals. By not pushing ourselves to learn and grow, we may find ourselves feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied with our lives. Additionally, not challenging ourselves can lead to a lack of personal fulfillment and a lack of purpose in our lives.

"Setting high aims is essential in order to achieve our goals. It pushes us to work harder while giving us the motivation to strive for more. When we aim high, there is a greater potential for success because it allows us to dream bigger and reach higher. However, there is a risk of failure when we set our aims too high, either due to an unrealistic timeline or a task that is too complex. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the level of difficulty that exists in any goal setting process. 

On the other hand, if we set our aims too low, we can become complacent or lose motivation to continue striving for something more. We can also fail to recognize or take advantage of the opportunity that exists in front of us. Therefore, it is important to challenge ourselves and find a healthy balance between aiming too high and too low. 

In conclusion, humans need to set their aims too high in order to achieve their goals. Doing so can cause both risks and rewards depending on how difficult the goal is. Consequently, it is better to find a balance between aiming too high and low in order to maximize success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"The question of implementing a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States is complex. Proponents of the scheme point out that it could save schools money on staff and transportation, as well as reducing absences and tardiness. Additionally, the extended days could give students more time for collaborative projects, experiential learning, and individualized instruction. 

On the other hand, opponents worry that the extended days could be difficult for working parents to manage, and that student learning could suffer if teachers are unable to cover the same amount of content in fewer days. Additionally, lower-income students could be disproportionately impacted, as they are less likely to have access to childcare and other academic resources outside of school.

Balancing these concerns, it appears that a four-day school week with extended hours is likely to be beneficial in some cases, such as rural communities or schools with tight budgets. However, extensive research should be done to ensure the implementation of such a scheme does not negatively impact student learning or access to education for all students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Pharmacists are healthcare professionals who work to ensure that patients receive the right medication at the right time. They are responsible for dispensing, administering, and monitoring medications to prevent adverse effects and ensure patient safety.

One of the primary job duties of a pharmacist is to dispense medications to patients. This involves reviewing prescriptions, verifying the patient's medical history, and ensuring that the medication being prescribed is appropriate for the patient's condition. Pharmacists also monitor the effects of medications on patients and provide counseling to help patients understand how to take their medications safely and effectively.

To become a pharmacist, one must first earn a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BSPh) degree. This typically involves four years of undergraduate study, including coursework in pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. After completing their BSPh degree, pharmacists must pass a national licensing exam to become registered pharmacists.

The salary range for pharmacists varies depending on factors such as location, experience, and specialization. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for pharmacists in the United States is $128,710. However, some pharmacists can earn salaries in excess of $200,000 per year.

The job outlook for pharmacists is positive. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of pharmacists will grow by 3% from 2019 to 2029, which is faster than the average for all occupations. This growth is due in part to the aging population, which is more likely to require medication management.

In conclusion, pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring patient safety and well-being by dispensing, administering, and monitoring medications. To become a pharmacist, one must earn a BSPh degree and pass a national licensing exam. The salary range for pharmacists varies depending on factors such as location and experience, but the job outlook is positive with projected growth of 3% from 2019 to 2029.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Research shows that recognizing a student's efforts can have a positive impact on their self-esteem and self-confidence. Studies have revealed that teacher recognition can motivate students to challenge themselves and work hard to reach their goals. Some people believe that teachers should only give recognition for work that meets or exceeds expectations, while others argue that recognition should still be given for effort, even when the results achieved are not up to expected standards. For example, a teacher might recognize a student with a 'try again' sticker, to show the student's effort was appreciated even though their work wasn't quite successful. Ultimately, it is up to the teacher to decide when and based on what criteria recognition should be given, although studies have found that recognition of any kind is beneficial.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"First impressions are incredibly important, and they can be very difficult to change. Our demeanour in the initial moments of meeting someone greatly affects how they perceive us, and as a result, it can be difficult to recover from a bad first impression. We tend to trust our initial gut instincts and remember them long after we have forgotten overall details and nuances, making it paramount to make the best impression the first time. 

To start, studies have shown that people form opinions about others within seconds of meeting them, and these opinions can become deeply entrenched. Depending on the context, the person’s demeanour, language, mannerisms, and even clothing choices can have an extreme impact. For example, someone in a business setting who is dressed in a well-tailored suit may have a different reception than someone in a more casual setting. 

On the other hand, a person’s attitude and behaviour can give a very favourable first impression as well. A friendly and confident attitude can be perceived positively, while someone who is outgoing and engaging can be well-received. Additionally, displaying proper etiquette and good social skills can give a good impression. In any of these cases, the kind of first impression someone makes can be deeply affected by their behaviour.

In conclusion, first impressions are incredibly important and can be difficult to change. Though our demeur can play a key role in how people initially perceive us, making proper choices and displaying confidence and good behaviour can create a favourable first impression, while making poor choices can create an unfavourable one.  Ultimately, being mindful of our demeanour and actions can make all the difference in making a great first impression.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Community service is a vital aspect of our lives. It is a way of giving back to the community and helping those in need. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that community service should be required in elementary school. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of community service and how it can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.

Firstly, community service provides a sense of purpose and responsibility. When children are required to perform community service, they learn to take ownership of their actions and the impact they have on the world around them. This sense of purpose can lead to a greater sense of self-esteem and a desire to continue helping others throughout their lives.

Secondly, community service can teach children valuable skills such as empathy, communication, and teamwork. These skills are essential for success in all areas of life, and by learning them at an early age, children can develop a strong foundation for future success.

Finally, community service can have a positive impact on the community itself. When children are involved in community service, they can help to improve the quality of life for those around them. This can include volunteering at a local food bank, participating in a beach clean-up, or assisting with a community garden.

In terms of completing community service in a reasonable amount of time, there are many ways to do so. One option is to volunteer as a group, such as through a school or community organization. This can help to divide the workload and make it easier to complete service hours in a shorter amount of time.

Another option is to choose service projects that are tailored to the child's interests and abilities. For example, if a child enjoys working with animals, they could volunteer at a local animal shelter. This not only allows them to help animals, but also provides them with a sense of fulfillment and purpose.

One real-life example of the success of community service is the impact that the President's Volunteer Service Awards have had on young people. This program recognizes individuals who have completed at least 100 hours of community service and encourages them to continue making a positive impact in their communities. The program has been successful in inspiring young people to become lifelong volunteers and make a difference in the world around them.

In conclusion, community service is a vital aspect of our lives, and it should be required",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Deciding for Yourself

Making decisions is a big part of life. Whether it's what to wear in the morning or what college to go to after high school, we all have to make choices. But sometimes, people rely too much on experts to make decisions for them. I think it's important to make your own decisions instead of seeking guidance from others.

First of all, when you make your own decisions, you learn more about yourself. You figure out what you want and what's important to you. For example, if you're trying to decide what college to go to, you might talk to your parents and teachers about what they think, but in the end, it's your decision. If you choose a college that you're not really interested in, you might end up being unhappy there. But if you made the decision yourself, you'll be more likely to put in the effort to make it work.

Another reason is that experts might not always know what's best for you. Sure, they might have more experience and knowledge, but they don't know your personal preferences and goals like you do. For example, if you're trying to decide what career to pursue, an expert might tell you that being a doctor is a good choice because it's well-paying and prestigious. But if you're not really interested in medicine, you might end up hating your job and feeling like you've wasted your time.

Finally, making your own decisions can be a great learning experience. When you have to think through the pros and cons of a decision and come to a conclusion on your own, you develop important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving. You learn how to weigh the evidence and make a decision based on what's most important to you. These skills will help you in all areas of life, not just making decisions.

Of course, it's okay to ask for advice from others sometimes. Everyone could use a second opinion or some fresh ideas. But ultimately, the decision should be yours. When you make your own decisions, you take ownership of your life and your choices. You're more",1,llama2_chat,3
"Extracurricular activities are an important part of a student's educational experience. They provide opportunities for students to explore their interests, develop new skills, and make connections with others. However, the impact of extracurricular activities on a student's academic success can vary greatly depending on how they are managed.

On one hand, students who participate in extracurricular activities and manage their time effectively can see many benefits. For example, participating in a sports team or club can help students develop teamwork and leadership skills, which can be applied to academic settings. Additionally, extracurricular activities can provide a sense of community and belonging, which can help students feel more engaged in their academic pursuits.

On the other hand, students who struggle to balance their academic and extracurricular commitments may find themselves falling behind in their classes. This can be especially true for students who have a lot of extracurricular activities or those who have a lot of responsibilities outside of school, such as caring for younger siblings or working part-time jobs.

To ensure that extracurricular activities have a positive impact on a student's academic success, it is important for students to prioritize their academic responsibilities and manage their time effectively. This may mean setting aside specific times for studying and completing assignments, and making sure to plan ahead for any extracurricular activities or events.

It is also important for parents and teachers to support students in their extracurricular pursuits. This may involve helping students set realistic goals and expectations, and providing guidance on time management and prioritization.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities can have a significant impact on a student's educational experience. While they can provide many benefits, it is important for students to manage their time effectively and prioritize their academic responsibilities to ensure that they have a positive impact on their academic success.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have had the opportunity to visit several new places and experience different cultures. One of my most memorable experiences was when I arrived in a new country. It was a thrilling and challenging experience for me, as I had to adapt to a new language, customs, and way of life.

When I first arrived in the country, I felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. I had never been to this place before, and I didn't know anyone there. I had to navigate through the unfamiliar streets and find my way to my hotel. It was a daunting task, but I managed to find my way with the help of a map and some friendly locals.

After settling into my hotel, I spent the next few days exploring the city with my friends and sister. We visited several landmarks and tried out local cuisine. It was an amazing experience, and I learned so much about the culture and history of the place.

However, my first day in school was a bit challenging. I was nervous about starting a new school in a new country, and I didn't know anyone there. It was hard to communicate with my teachers and classmates, and I felt like an outsider. But I quickly realized that I needed to adapt and make friends. I started talking to my classmates and joining clubs and extracurricular activities. It wasn't easy, but I managed to make some friends and feel more comfortable in my new school.

Overall, my experiences in the new country have made a lasting impression on me. I learned how to adapt to new situations and embrace change. I also learned about the importance of cultural awareness and respect. I will always cherish the memories of my trip and the lessons I learned. I am grateful for the opportunity to have experienced such a diverse and exciting culture, and I will carry these experiences with me throughout my life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"The school day is a topic that has been debated for many years. Some people believe that schools should have longer days, while others believe that they should have shorter days. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards extending the school day to a four-day school week. While there are some advantages to this idea, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered.

One of the main advantages of having a four-day school week is that it would give students more time to focus on their studies. With fewer days in the week, students would have more time to study and complete their homework. This could lead to better academic performance and higher test scores. Additionally, a four-day school week would give students more time to participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports and clubs, which can be beneficial for their overall development.

Another advantage of a four-day school week is that it would give teachers more time to prepare for their lessons. With fewer days in the week, teachers would have more time to plan and prepare their lessons, which could lead to more effective teaching and better student outcomes. Additionally, a four-day school week would give teachers more time to attend professional development workshops and training, which can be beneficial for their career growth.

However, there are also some disadvantages to consider. One of the main disadvantages is that a four-day school week would require students to attend school for longer hours each day. This could be problematic for students who have difficulty concentrating for extended periods of time, as they may become tired or bored. Additionally, a four-day school week could put additional pressure on students to complete their work in a shorter amount of time, which could lead to stress and anxiety.

Another disadvantage of a four-day school week is that it could be more expensive for families. With fewer days in the week, families would have to pay for childcare for an additional day each week. This could be a significant financial burden for families, especially those with lower incomes. Additionally, a four-day school week could lead to increased traffic congestion and higher transportation costs, as more students would be on the roads at the same time.

"A 7-day break after every 2 weeks of schooling would be beneficial in many ways. Firstly, students would have a chance to take a step back and refresh, helping them become more attentive and engaged in their classroom studies. studies have shown that regular breaks can improve a student’s motivation, focus, and relationship with their teachers. 

Additionally, taking breaks regularly allows for students to experience a variety of activities that are not typically found in the classroom. Many students have reported in surveys that learning something new or doing something creative during the break has helped them gain unique insights and knowledge that they can then apply in their studies. 

Finally, breaking up the school year into shorter intervals can also help reduce student fatigue and stress; students would be able to better manage their coursework and have more time for rest and relaxation. Schools that have implemented the 7-day break initiative have also noted that overall attendance and grades have improved significantly, showing the impact such breaks have on students’ academic performance. 

In conclusion, regular breaks offer many benefits, allowing for students to both engage in scholastic activities and enjoy leisure activities outside of the classroom. It is evident that implementing the 7-day break after every 2 weeks of schooling can drastically improve a student’s academic motivation and performance.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Okay! Here is my essay:

Have you ever tried to reach a goal, but kept hitting roadblocks? Maybe you failed a test, or didn't get the part in the play you wanted. It can be really discouraging, but what if I told you that many successful people have been through the same thing? They didn't let failure stop them!

Winston Churchill once said, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" That means even when things don't go right, you should keep trying! Think about it, if you never gave up, you might just find success.

Take the light blob for example. It's a weird thing, but it's a great example of determination. Scientists were trying to create a new type of battery, but it kept failing. They were about to give up when they realized they could use the blob to help them. It turned out to be a great conductor of electricity! If they had given up, we wouldn't have that cool new battery.

Enthusiasm is super important when trying to reach a goal. If you don't care about what you're doing, you're less likely to keep going when things get tough. When you're excited about something, you're more motivated to keep trying.

But, what if you're not excited about something? What if you're just doing it because you have to? Well, that's when it's important to find your passion. When you're doing something you love, you're more likely to keep going even when things get tough.

Sometimes, people will try to bring you down by giving you negative feedback. They might tell you that you can't do something, or that you're not good enough. But, you shouldn't let them get to you! Just ignore them and keep going.

So, the next time you're feeling discouraged, remember Winston Churchill's quote. Keep going, even when things don't go right. And, find your passion! It's the key to success. And, don't let anyone bring you down with their negative feedback. You got this!",1,llama2_chat,3
"Working in a group versus working on an assignment alone has been a topic of debate among students, teachers, and professionals. While some people believe that working alone is more efficient and productive, others argue that working in a group can bring numerous benefits. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of working in a group versus working on an assignment alone, using examples from personal experience and outside sources to provide evidence for my argument.

One of the most significant benefits of working in a group is the opportunity to share ideas and perspectives. When working alone, it can be easy to become tunnel-visioned and miss out on different approaches to a problem. However, when working in a group, individuals can bounce ideas off each other and come up with more creative solutions. For example, during a group project in my English class, we were tasked with creating a persuasive speech on a controversial topic. Each member of the group had a different perspective on the issue, and by discussing our ideas, we were able to create a well-rounded and thoughtful speech.

Another benefit of working in a group is the ability to learn from others. When working alone, it can be challenging to identify areas for improvement or to receive constructive feedback. However, when working in a group, individuals can learn from their peers and receive feedback on their work. For instance, during a group project in my science class, we were tasked with conducting an experiment and analyzing the results. Each member of the group had a different role, and by working together, we were able to learn from each other and improve our understanding of the scientific method.

Working in a group can also foster a sense of community and collaboration. When working alone, it can be easy to feel isolated and disconnected from others. However, when working in a group, individuals can develop relationships with their peers and work together towards a common goal. For example, during a group project in my history class, we were tasked with creating a presentation on a historical event. We worked together to research the topic, create visual aids, and practice our presentation. By the end of the project, we had developed a strong bond and were proud of our work.

In conclusion, working in a group has numerous benefits that can outweigh working on an assignment alone. By sharing ideas, learning from others, and fostering a sense of community, working in a group can lead",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that changing the school lunch menu is a topic that deserves our attention. While some students may enjoy the current menu, I believe that there are several reasons why it should be changed. In this essay, I will examine the pros and cons of changing the school lunch menu, and argue that the benefits of making the change outweigh the costs.

One of the main advantages of changing the school lunch menu is that it would provide students with more options. Currently, the menu is limited, and many students are forced to eat the same meal every day. This can be frustrating for those who have dietary restrictions or simply do not like the food. By offering more options, students would be able to choose a meal that they actually enjoy, which could lead to a more positive dining experience.

Another benefit of changing the school lunch menu is that it could improve the quality of the food. While the current menu may be affordable, it is likely that it is made with cheap, processed ingredients. By offering healthier, more nutritious options, students would be better able to maintain their health and energy levels throughout the day. This could lead to improved academic performance and overall well-being.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to changing the school lunch menu. One concern is that it could be more expensive. While the current menu may be affordable, it is likely that more expensive options would be required to provide the nutritional value and variety that students deserve. This could be a challenge for schools with limited budgets, and could lead to higher costs for students and their families.

Another potential drawback of changing the school lunch menu is that it could lead to more waste. If students are given more options, they may be more likely to waste food. This could be a concern for schools that are already struggling with waste management, and could lead to additional costs and environmental impact.

In conclusion, I believe that changing the school lunch menu is a topic that deserves our attention. While there are some potential drawbacks to making the change, the benefits of providing students with more options and improving the quality of the food far outweigh the costs. By making this change, schools can provide a more positive dining experience for their students, and help to improve their overall well-being.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that providing healthier food options in the school cafeteria is essential for the well-being of students. In this essay, I will research the various healthier food options that can be provided to students and propose a plan for implementation. I will also outline the potential cost benefits and health benefits for students that could come with the change.

Firstly, it is essential to understand the importance of providing healthy food options in the school cafeteria. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), childhood obesity rates have tripled in the past four decades, and it is estimated that one in five children in the United States is overweight or obese. Providing healthy food options in the school cafeteria can help combat this problem by encouraging students to make healthier choices and reducing their risk of obesity and other health problems.

Secondly, there are various healthy food options that can be provided to students in the school cafeteria. These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. For example, instead of serving high-calorie, high-fat burgers and fries, schools can offer grilled chicken sandwiches with whole-grain buns and a side of vegetables. Instead of serving sugary snacks like cookies and brownies, schools can offer fresh fruit and vegetable sticks with hummus or low-fat yogurt.

Thirdly, implementing these healthier food options in the school cafeteria can have significant cost benefits. According to a study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, schools that offer healthier food options have lower rates of absenteeism and higher rates of academic achievement. This can lead to cost savings for schools in the long run, as they will not have to spend as much money on medical bills and special education services for students who are overweight or obese.

Fourthly, providing healthier food options in the school cafeteria can have significant health benefits for students. As I mentioned earlier, childhood obesity rates have tripled in the past four decades, and this trend is expected to continue unless action is taken. By providing healthier food options in the school cafeteria, schools can help combat this problem and reduce the risk of obesity and other health problems for students",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I have been thinking about my future and the career path I want to pursue. While it is common for young people to be unsure about their future, research shows that elementary and middle school students are actually committed to a career. In this essay, I will discuss the differences between elementary and middle school students and how they approach career choices, analyze why people may believe that teenagers cannot commit to a career, discuss the possibility of teenagers showing people that not all teens are the same and their ability to commit to a career, and explain the challenges of committing to a career at a young age.

Elementary school students tend to be more focused on their immediate future and may not have a clear idea of what they want to do when they grow up. They may be influenced by their family, friends, and teachers when making career decisions. Middle school students, on the other hand, tend to be more independent and may have a better understanding of their interests and strengths. They may also be more influenced by their own research and exploration when making career decisions.

One reason why people may believe that teenagers cannot commit to a career is because they are still young and may not have enough life experience to make an informed decision. They may also be influenced by peer pressure and may not have a clear understanding of their own values and goals. However, research shows that many teenagers are actually committed to a career and are making informed decisions based on their interests and strengths.

It is important to recognize that not all teenagers are the same and that some may be more mature and capable of committing to a career at a young age. These teenagers may have a clear understanding of their values and goals and may be motivated by their passion for a particular career. They may also have the support of their family and teachers, which can help them make a more informed decision.

However, committing to a career at a young age can also be challenging. It is important for teenagers to have the opportunity to explore their interests and gain experience in their chosen field. They may also need to consider the long-term implications of their career decisions and make sure that they are aligned with their values and goals.

In conclusion, while it is common for young people to be unsure about their future, research shows that elementary and middle school students are actually committed to a career. It is important to recognize the differences between elementary and",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay comparing Winston Churchill's view on failure and my own opinion on failure as an average 8th grade student:

Winston Churchill, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was known for his unwavering optimism and resilience in the face of failure. He believed that failure was not the end of the world, but rather a stepping stone to success. In his famous speech to the British people during World War II, he said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote shows how Churchill viewed failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than a reason to give up.

Personally, I agree with Churchill's view on failure. I think that failure is a natural part of life, and it's important to learn from our mistakes rather than letting them hold us back. When I fail at something, whether it's in school or in a sports game, I try to see it as a chance to improve and do better next time. I know that I can't succeed at everything, but I can always learn from my failures and become a better person because of them.

One time I failed a test in math, and I was really upset at first. But then I realized that I had learned a lot from the experience, and that I could use that knowledge to do better on the next test. So, I studied harder and got a better grade on the next test. If I had given up after the first failure, I would have missed out on the opportunity to improve and do better.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill and I both believe that failure is not the end of the world. It's a chance to learn and grow, and to become better people because of our experiences. So, the next time you fail at something, don't give up! Use it as an opportunity to improve and succeed.",1,llama2_chat,1
"Dear Local Government,

I strongly disagree with the idea of adopting a four-day work week for our school. While it may seem like a convenient solution to some, I believe it would have numerous disadvantages for students like me.

Firstly, one of the main reasons we go to school is to learn and do more work. By cutting a day from the week, we would have less time to complete assignments, projects, and other academic tasks. This would lead to a significant decrease in the quality of our education, which is something that I believe is essential for our future success. I know that teachers work hard to provide us with a good education, and I don't want to see their efforts compromised by a shorter school week.

Another issue with a four-day school week is the rise of pressure and homework on students. With more days off, we would have more time to focus on our schoolwork, which could lead to an increase in stress and pressure to perform well. As it is, we already have a lot of homework and projects to complete, and adding more days off would only make things worse. I know that some students might enjoy the extra day off, but I think it would be better to focus on our studies and not have to worry about constantly juggling schoolwork and free time.

Finally, I think the three-day weekend would make us unfocused and less productive. While it might be nice to have an extra day off, I think it would be better to have a consistent schedule that allows us to focus on our studies without distractions. With a four-day week, we would have to cram all of our schoolwork into four days, which could lead to burnout and decreased productivity. Plus, I think it would be harder to stay motivated and engaged in our studies when we have so much free time.

I understand that some people might think that a four-day week would be more convenient for working parents, but I believe that the disadvantages outweigh any potential benefits. As a student, I think it's important to have a consistent schedule that allows us to focus on our studies and not have to worry about constantly adjusting to a new schedule.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea of adopting a four-day work week for our school.",1,llama2_chat,0
"When it comes to making decisions, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Everyone has different perspectives, experiences, and outlooks that could influence the outcome of the decision. This is why it is important to seek multiple opinions when making decisions. Doing so can broaden your understanding of the situation, give you a fresh perspective, help you make a more informed decision, and provide validation that the decision you made was the right one. 

Gathering multiple opinions not only allows you to get a better understanding of the consequences of your decision, but also helps to ensure that you are not overlooking any potential issues or alternate solutions. Gathering multiple opinions can also help to ensure that the decision you make is well-informed and that no important information was overlooked. Additionally, having a variety of opinions can prevent any biases you may have from influencing the decision. By taking other people’s views into consideration, you are more likely to make a decision that is in everyone’s best interest.

In conclusion, it is essential to seek multiple opinions when making a decision in order to gain the best outcome. Gathering alternative outlooks and perspectives will help make sure that the decision made is well-informed and unbiased. Taking other’s opinions into account can also provide validation that the decision you make is in everyone's best interest. Ultimately, gathering multiple opinions is the best way to guarantee an informed and balanced decision.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"As an 8th grader, I believe that committing to a career at a young age has numerous advantages. Being young and having the capacity to learn faster is one of the most significant benefits. When you're young, your brain is like a sponge, soaking up information and skills quickly and easily. This means that if you commit to a career at a young age, you'll have the opportunity to learn and develop your skills more quickly, giving you a head start in your chosen field.

Another advantage of committing to a career at a young age is the mental and knowledge preparation it provides. When you're young, you have the time and energy to focus on your career goals without the added stress of other responsibilities like a job or family. This means that you can dedicate yourself fully to your career, learning and growing in a way that will help you succeed in the long run. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can help you build a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, which will make it easier to adapt to new challenges and opportunities as you grow and develop.

However, I also understand that some students may not want to commit to a career at a young age. Maybe they're still exploring their interests and passions, or maybe they're unsure of what they want to do in the future. It's important to recognize that everyone's journey is different, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to career development. It's okay to take your time and explore your options, as long as you're still working towards your goals and developing your skills.

Finally, I think it's important for students to have chosen a career path by the time they graduate from high school. While it's okay to change your mind or explore different options, having a clear idea of what you want to do in the future can help you stay focused and motivated. It can also make it easier to make decisions about your education and career, knowing what you want to achieve in the long run.

In conclusion, committing to a career at a young age has numerous advantages, including the benefit of being young and having the capacity to learn faster, the advantages of mental and knowledge preparation, and the need for students to have chosen a career path by the time they graduate",1,llama2_chat,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that adding one and a half hours to school each day would have a significant impact on both students and teachers. While some may argue that this added time would benefit students academically and socially, I believe that it would have negative consequences for both groups.

Firstly, adding one and a half hours to school each day would put a significant strain on teachers. Teachers are already responsible for managing their classrooms, grading assignments, and preparing for future lessons. Adding more time to the school day would require them to work even harder, potentially leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. This could also result in a decrease in the quality of education that students receive, as teachers may not have the time or energy to provide the best possible instruction.

Secondly, adding one and a half hours to school each day would not necessarily benefit students academically or socially. While some students may use this additional time to study or work on assignments, many others may use it to socialize or engage in other activities that do not contribute to their academic success. Additionally, some students may struggle to manage their time effectively, leading to decreased productivity and academic performance.

Furthermore, adding one and a half hours to school each day could also have negative consequences for students' mental health. Studies have shown that teenagers who attend school for longer hours are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. This could lead to a decrease in overall well-being and academic performance.

In conclusion, while some may argue that adding one and a half hours to school each day would benefit students academically and socially, I believe that it would have negative consequences for both students and teachers. Instead of adding more time to the school day, we should focus on providing students with the resources and support they need to succeed academically and socially outside of the classroom. This could include access to tutoring, mentoring, and extracurricular activities that promote academic and social growth.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay! 😃 So, you know how sometimes people can be, like, super mean or disrespectful at school? It's like, totally not cool, right? And I'm sure we've all been there before where we see someone acting out or being a bad influence on others. But, like, have you ever thought about how we can be good influences on people instead? 🤔

Like, think about it. When someone is being a good friend, they're showing compassion and kindness towards others. They're being understanding and supportive, and they're not afraid to stand up for what's right. And, like, when we're around people who are exhibiting these good behaviors, it's way more likely that we'll start to mimic them and behave well too! 🤝

But, like, bad influences can totally happen too. When someone is being mean or disrespectful, it can be really easy for us to start acting that way too.

"In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the health of students in schools. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of a balanced school menu. Many students are consuming foods that are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can lead to a range of health problems. In this essay, I will analyze the potential benefits of providing students with a more balanced school menu in terms of overall health and longevity.

Firstly, a balanced school menu can help to reduce the risk of obesity in students. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), childhood obesity rates in the United States have tripled since the 1970s, and it is estimated that one in three children is overweight or obese. One of the main causes of childhood obesity is a diet that is high in unhealthy foods and low in nutrients. By providing students with a more balanced school menu, schools can help to reduce the risk of obesity and promote a healthier lifestyle.

Secondly, a balanced school menu can help to improve the overall health of students. A diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide students with the nutrients they need to grow and develop properly. It can also help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. By providing students with a more balanced school menu, schools can help to promote good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases later in life.

Thirdly, a balanced school menu can help to improve the academic performance of students. There is a growing body of research that suggests that diet plays a role in academic performance. For example, a study published in the Journal of School Health found that students who ate a healthy breakfast were more likely to perform better on standardized tests than those who did not eat breakfast. By providing students with a more balanced school menu, schools can help to improve their academic performance and set them on the path to success.

In conclusion, providing students with a more balanced school menu has the potential to bring a range of benefits in terms of overall health and longevity. By reducing the risk of obesity, improving overall health, and improving academic performance, schools can help to set their students on the path to a healthier and",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Taking online courses provides students with convenience and flexibility with regards to their educational pursuits. By taking online courses, students can access their course materials any time, any place, as long as they have an internet connection, as well as watch lectures, take exams, and engage in classroom discussions.

In comparison to in-person courses, online courses offer a wide variety of courses and topics that may not be available in a local classroom setting. Furthermore, the lack of an in-person class schedule allows students the opportunity to manage their time more effectively so they can accomplish work-related, educational, and leisure activities.

Despite the many advantages of taking online courses, in-person instruction is beneficial in helping to motivate students and ensure that they are on track to complete their courses. Online courses require students to be self-motivated and assume responsibility for their learning, and understanding the material. 

Finally, taking online courses enhances skills sought after by employers such as developing self-discipline and time management. Online courses allow students to organisationally plan for assignments, and help develop organizational and problem-solving skills in life and within the workplace.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Hey, so I'm gonna write this essay about how distance learning can provide more opportunities for students who can't go to school 'cause of financial or other restrictions. I think it's a pretty cool topic, and I'm gonna try my best to make it sound good.

So, first off, distance learning is like, totally different from regular school. Instead of going to a physical classroom, you can learn from home or wherever you want, using like, a computer or a phone. And that's awesome 'cause it means that students who can't afford to go to school, or who live in places where there aren't any good schools, can still learn stuff.

Like, imagine you're in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and there's no high school nearby. You could still learn all the stuff you need to graduate and get a good job, even if you can't go to school. You could just use a computer to watch videos and do assignments, and you'd still be able to learn stuff. That's pretty cool, right?

And it's not just about money. There are other reasons why students might not be able to go to school, like if they're sick or if they have to take care of a family member. With distance learning, they can still learn even if they can't go to school in person.

Now, some people might think that distance learning isn't as good as regular school, 'cause you don't get to see your teachers and classmates in person. But I think that's not true. You can still talk to your teachers and classmates online, and you can still learn just as much as you would in a regular classroom.

One of the best things about distance learning is that it's flexible. You can do it whenever you want, as long as you finish your work on time. That means you can learn at your own pace, and you don't have to worry about missing out on anything.

So, in conclusion, distance learning is a really cool way for students who can't go to school to still learn and get an education. It's flexible, and it's a great way for students to learn from anywhere, even if they can't go to",1,llama2_chat,4
"Having a successful business takes more than just good ideas and hard work. Numerous factors come into play, including external factors such as the economy, which can dramatically affect a business's success. It is therefore important to consider all possible reasons why a business could fail and devise a plan to help business owners come up with ideas to ensure success. Furthermore, those who experience failure can find solace in the stories of successful people who overcame their struggles and rose to success. A great example of this is Winston Churchill, who despite suffering many disappointments and failures in his lifetime, managed to make a huge contribution to society. This illustrates the importance of perseverance and continuing to pursue goals despite any setbacks.

"The subject of requiring students to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities has caused significant debate among educators, students, and other stakeholders. In one camp, it is argued that requiring students to maintain a certain academic standard helps to reward hard work in the classroom and also encourages them to take their studies seriously as opposed to being a distraction from their academic pursuits. On the other side, however, some have raised the point that this policy could unfairly limit the opportunities of some students who may excel in activities such as sports or the arts but lack the academic skills needed to maintain a B average. 

My position is that requiring a B average to participate in school activities is an unfair policy that can heavily impact students who are struggling with their school work and put a financial burden on families who already struggle to afford extracurricular activities. A policy such as this can ultimately have the opposite intended effect, as it may serve to discourage low-income students and other minorities from participating in activities due to the additional difficulty in meeting the required average. Furthermore, it could potentially lead to alienation among students who are unable to meet the academic requirements, which would further impact their engagement in school activities. 

While the intention of requiring a B average is to ensure students have a strong academic foundation, the potential consequences and disadvantages of such a policy suggest that it is not an effective solution for achieving this goal. Rather, it is important to provide support and mentorship for struggling students to ensure they receive the education and resources they need to succeed.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"The Benefits of Working with a Group

As an eighth-grade student, I have had the opportunity to work both alone and in groups on various projects and assignments. While working alone can be beneficial in some situations, I have found that working with a group has many more benefits. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of working with a group, brainstorm ideas on how working with a group can help with learning new things and getting work done faster, and compare the benefits of working with a group and working alone.

One of the main benefits of working with a group is the ability to learn from others. When working with a group, you are exposed to different perspectives and ideas. This can help you think critically and creatively, as you may come up with solutions that you would not have considered on your own. Additionally, working with a group can help you develop communication skills, as you will need to listen to others and express your own ideas clearly.

Another benefit of working with a group is the ability to get work done faster. When working with a group, you can divide the work among the members, allowing each person to focus on a specific task. This can help you complete the work more efficiently, as you can work together to solve problems and overcome obstacles. Additionally, working with a group can help you stay motivated, as you will have others to work with and support you.

When comparing the benefits of working with a group and working alone, it is important to consider the pressure and environment of each situation. Working alone can be stressful, as you may feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of completing the work on your own. On the other hand, working with a group can be less stressful, as you will have others to help you and share the workload. Additionally, working in a group can be more enjoyable, as you will have the opportunity to collaborate with others and build relationships.

There are many different ways that groups can help with grades and learning new things. One way is through peer review, where group members can provide feedback on each other's work. This can help improve the quality of the work and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, groups can provide a supportive environment for learning, as members can ask questions and seek help from each other.

Teachers may structure groups of students in different ways, depending on the task or assignment. Some teachers may have students work",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"For many students, staying two extra hours in school is a challenge. Having an extra two hours tacked onto the regular school day puts an undue burden on students who may already be lacking in energy or time. Having a full day of school can take a toll on students’ physical and mental energy, and asking them to stay two additional hours with limited resources can be overwhelming. 

For instance, students who are already feeling overwhelmed by academic tasks may reach a breaking point when faced with the option of staying for an additional two hours of school. While it may not seem like much time, it can be the tipping point between feeling exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. Moreover, staying an extra two hours in school can also make it more difficult for those with after-school commitments to honor outside obligations or just spend time with family. 

The lack of time and energy can also have a psychological effect on students. If they are not able to stay the extra two hours, they may feel a sense of guilt or disappointment. It can be emotionally challenging for students to leave school in the middle of a lesson and feel like they are letting both themselves and the teacher down. 

In conclusion, staying an extra two hours in school can be an incredibly stressful experience for students who may already be feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage their time and energy. Not being able to stay for those extra two hours can have both physical and psychological consequences. It’s important to remember that everyone copes in different ways and we must take into account students’ individual needs before making decisions about the length of the school day.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Albert Einstein famously said “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.” This statement speaks to the power of imagination and its ability to stretch beyond circumstances and possibilitites of the physical. Knowledge may guide us through life, but imagination can help us envision a better world. 

For instance, the technological advances of the 20th century would have been impossible if it hadn’t been for the imaginations of inventors like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. Without their vision, we wouldn’t have access to lightning-fast communication and other tools that rely upon the power of imagination.

Imagination can also be credited with our ability to progress culturally and spiritually. When we embrace imagination, it helps us envision paths to personal growth and transformation. It can constantly inspire us to think bigger and better, to uncover new insights and explore our own potential. 

In many respects, imagination is the tool with which we build the future. It is more important than knowledge because it enables us to find creative solutions to our problems, build upon our wins, and become wiser as a collective. Without it, our ambition to learn and grow our potential would be limited. 

Ultimately, imagination is more important than knowledge because it is the spark that triggers creativity, discovery, and progress. It allows us to reshape our reality and pursue a better tomorrow. Through our imagination, we can rewrite the rules and design the future.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

"Okay, here's my essay:

Adding 90 minutes to the school day: Good or Bad?

As an 8th grader, I think about how my day goes and how it could be improved. Adding 90 minutes to the school day is a topic that has been around for a while, and I think it's important to consider the potential impacts of this change.

First of all, let's talk about students' alertness. I know I can get tired in the afternoon, especially after lunch. If we add 90 minutes to the school day, it could be harder for me to stay focused and alert in class. I might feel like I need a nap, which could make it harder to learn new things. On the other hand, some people might argue that this extra time could be used for more learning and activities, which could make us more alert and engaged.

Next, let's look at the teacher workload. Adding more time to the school day means teachers would have to prepare and grade more work. This could be a challenge, especially if they already feel overwhelmed with the work they have now. Some teachers might not want to take on more responsibilities, which could lead to lower quality teaching and learning. However, other teachers might see this as an opportunity to provide more personalized instruction and support to their students.

Now, let's talk about extracurricular activities. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other activities outside of school. Adding 90 minutes to the school day could mean that these activities would have to be cut or moved to earlier in the day. This could be a problem for students who rely on these activities to stay active and engaged. On the other hand, some students might argue that they need more time to focus on their studies and don't have time for extracurricular activities.

Finally, let's think about family time. Many students have after-school jobs or family responsibilities, and adding more time to the school day could mean that they have less time to spend with their families. This could be difficult for students who rely on this time to connect with their loved ones and maintain a work-life balance.

In conclusion, adding 90 minutes to the school day could have both positive and negative impacts on students, teachers",1,llama2_chat,1

"Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, but I'll give it a shot! Here's my essay on the importance of self-reliance and making individual decisions:

Self-reliance and making individual decisions are super important for personal growth. When we rely on ourselves, we learn to think for ourselves and make choices that are best for us. Like, if we want to buy a house, we should be the ones to make the decision, not our parents or friends. It's our money, and we should get to choose how we want to spend it.

Same thing with getting married. If we want to get married, it's our choice. We should be the ones to decide who we want to spend the rest of our lives with, not our parents or society. And don't even get me started on dropping out of school. If we want to drop out, it's our decision. We should be the ones to decide whether or not we want to continue our education.

But here's the thing – sometimes asking for someone else's opinion can be detrimental. Like, if we're not sure what to do, it's okay to ask for advice. But if we're just doing it because we don't want to take responsibility for our own decisions, that's not cool. We should be the ones to make the decisions, not just because we don't want to take the blame if it doesn't work out.

For example, I know this one kid who wanted to buy a car. His parents were like, ""No way, you're too young!"" But he really wanted it, so he saved up his own money and bought it himself. And you know what? He ended up loving it! It was a great decision for him, and he learned a lot from it.

But on the other hand, there's this other kid who wanted to drop out of school. His parents were like, ""No way, you have to finish high school!"" But he didn't really want to, so he dropped out and ended up getting a job at McDonald's. And you know what? He's still struggling to make ends meet, and he wishes he had finished school.

"Success can be a difficult concept to define, and even more difficult to achieve. While some argue that it is only through the experience of numerous failures that success can be achieved, others assert that success can be achieved even without the hardships of numerous failures. 

Those who argue that success depends on failure cite the fact that failure gives opportunity for growth and insight. With each failure, we come to understand the shortcomings of our plans and can make improvements to find ultimate success. Thomas Edison famously said, “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” This exemplifies how failure can aid us on our path to success.

On the other hand, some people believe that success can be obtained without failure, and point to examples of those who found success without making any serious mistakes. They argue that success can be achieved with hard work, dedication, and perhaps a little luck.

In my opinion, true success is a combination of both failure and success. Without failure, a person may not gain the necessary experience and setback needed to recognize what steps need to be taken in order to succeed.

As an 8th grader, I've been thinking a lot about my future and how I can get ahead in life.  And you know what? A 3-year high school program seems like a pretty cool way to do just that! 

First of all, let's talk about the benefits.  If I were to enroll in a 3-year high school program, I'd get to learn at a faster pace and cover more material than your average high school student.  That means I'd be way more prepared for college and the workforce when I graduate. Plus, I'd have more time to focus on my passions and interests, like playing the guitar or volunteering in my community.  It's like, I'd have more time to be a well-rounded person! 

But,  there are also some drawbacks to consider.  For one, a 3-year high school program might be really challenging.  Like, I'd have to work even harder than my peers to keep up with the accelerated pace. And what if I can't handle it?  What if I get overwhelmed and struggle to keep up?  That would be super stressful and might even affect my mental health. 

Now,  here's where I come in.  I think the benefits of a 3-year high school program outweigh the drawbacks.  I mean, think about it. If I'm able to learn more and faster, I'll be way more prepared for the future.  And if I'm more prepared, I'll have more opportunities open to me.  Like, I could go to a top college or land my dream job right out of high school.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Being prompt is an invaluable life skill that can open doors of opportunity, increase productivity, and lead to better outcomes in many aspects of life. Promptness is especially important in the professional world; arriving to meetings, client calls, or events on time shows respect and implies reliability. Taking the initiative to meet deadlines and complete projects ahead of time communicates that one is organized and responsible. 

Though there is great reward in being prompt, it can be a challenge to make sure one is always on time. To ensure promptness, it is important to create a plan in advance and make sure to leave plenty of time for surprises. Practicing appropriate time management and having realistic expectations can also help to keep on track. Setting reminders or asking for help from family and friends can be useful in providing accountability.

On the contrary, those who are habitually late can appear unreliable and inconsiderate, leaving a lasting impression. Even if a person is merely a few minutes late, it can affect their professional reputation and interfere with their work relationships. People who are laid back with time can find themselves lagging behind, missing important events, and otherwise avoiding success.

Overall, being prompt can be highly beneficial and help to ensure positive outcomes. Taking the necessary steps to be prompt and on time will lead to improved productivity and progress in life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

"Taking music, drama, and art classes can have numerous benefits for students. These classes can help students develop their creativity, social skills, and academic performance. However, there are also some drawbacks to consider. Additionally, the support of parents is crucial for students to fully benefit from these activities.

One of the main benefits of taking music, drama, and art classes is the development of creativity. These classes provide students with an opportunity to express themselves in unique ways. Through music, students can learn to play instruments, write songs, and perform in front of an audience. In drama, students can act out different scenarios and develop their public speaking skills. Art classes allow students to explore different mediums and create their own pieces of art. All of these activities require students to think outside the box and come up with new ideas, which can help them develop their creativity.

Another benefit of taking these classes is the improvement of social skills. In music, drama, and art classes, students work together in groups to create performances and projects. This allows them to collaborate with others and learn to communicate effectively. These classes also provide a safe space for students to express themselves and connect with others who share similar interests. This can help students build friendships and develop a sense of community.

In addition to these benefits, taking music, drama, and art classes can also improve academic performance. These classes require students to think critically and analytically, which can help them develop important study skills. Furthermore, these classes can help students develop discipline and time management skills, which are essential for success in school and beyond.

However, there are also some drawbacks to consider when taking these classes. For example, some students may not have the time or resources to participate in these activities. Additionally, some students may not have an interest in these subjects, which can make it difficult for them to fully engage in the class. Finally, some students may feel pressure to perform at a high level, which can lead to stress and anxiety.

The support of parents is crucial for students to fully benefit from these activities. Parents can provide their children with the resources and encouragement they need to participate in music, drama, and art classes. For example, parents can help their children find time in their schedules to practice their instruments or attend rehearsals. Additionally, parents can provide their children with constructive feedback and encouragement when they are struggling with a particular project or",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As we journey through life, it is important to strive to grow in order to strengthen our skills and improve our abilities. Trying new things instead of staying in the same place and never growing is a great way to accomplish this. By exposing ourselves to new experiences, we can discover talents or skills that we may have never known we had. Learning to cook a new recipe or playing a new sport for the first time can open us up to completely new skills and new talents that we can explore. 

For example, taking a pottery class could open up a whole new world of three-dimensional art that we had no idea we could create. Or, if we decide to learn an instrument, we can surprise ourselves with our own aural abilities. Trying new things can also help us gain valuable knowledge for the future and help us build self-confidence. 

So if you’ve ever wondered how you can become the best version of yourself, start reaching out of your comfort zone and try something new. It may present you with new and unexpected opportunities to grow—and who knows, you just might find a new passion or talent you never knew you had!",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"As the old adage goes, “attitude is everything”—and it's true! Having a good attitude can have a tremendous impact on almost every area of our lives, from our personal lives to our professional lives. It can have a powerful effect on our ability to learn things, our chances of getting good results, and even our overall success.

For instance, having a positive attitude can make us better learners because it helps us stay motivated and inspired to keep going even when things get difficult. We are able to persevere when faced with challenges by keeping an optimistic outlook. We are more likely to experiment, ask questions, and learn from our mistakes when our attitude is positive.

Furthermore, a good attitude can directly result in better results in almost any task. When we approach a project with enthusiasm and a can-do attitude, we are more likely to take risks and be creative with our solutions. This open-mindedness and positive outlook tends to lead to more successful outcomes.

I experienced this firsthand when I decided to take on a big writing project while I was still in college. Even though I had no prior experience with the type of writing needed for the project, I was determined to succeed. With a positive attitude, I approached the challenge head on and worked diligently until the project was complete. In the end, the project was a success, and I was even able to win a prize for my work. That is an experience that I will never forget, and I am sure I would not have been so successful had I not had a good attitude.

In conclusion, having a good attitude is beneficial on many levels. It gives us the drive and determination to pursue our goals despite any obstacles we may face. It can also help us achieve better results by keeping us open to learning new things and encouraging us to take risks. No matter how hard the task, having the right attitude can help us to reach our full potential and lead us to success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4

"Okay, here's my essay:

Competition in the workplace can be a great thing. It makes us work harder and be better. When we're competing with our coworkers, we want to do a good job so we can be the best. It's like a race to see who can do the most work or make the most money. It makes us want to work harder and be better.

But sometimes competition can be bad too. When it's too much, it can make people stressed out and not want to work at all. It's like, why bother if someone else is going to get the promotion? Or why work hard if someone else is going to take all the credit? That can make people not like coming to work and not want to do their best.

But overall, competition in the workplace can be good. It makes us work harder and be better. It's like a challenge, and we want to see if we can do it. It makes us feel good when we do a good job and see that we're better than someone else. It's like, yessss, I did it!

I think that competition in the workplace is important because it makes us want to do our best. It's like a game, and we want to win. When we're competing, we're not thinking about how hard it is or how tired we are. We're just thinking about how we can do better than the other person. It makes us focus and be more productive.

So, in conclusion, competition in the workplace can be good or bad, depending on how much there is. But overall, it makes us work harder and be better. It's like a challenge, and we want to see if we can do it. And when we do, it feels great!",1,llama2_chat,4
"Title: The Power of Character Traits: Shaping Our Lives and Inspiring Others

As an 8th grader, I have learned that character traits are essential for personal growth and development. Through research and exploration, I have discovered why certain traits are important, how they are shaped by environment, upbringing, and personal experiences, and how influential people have inspired the development of these traits. I will examine the differences in how kids and adults approach developing character traits and analyze the consequences of choosing certain traits.

Character traits are the qualities that define who we are as individuals. They can be good or bad, and they shape our interactions with others and our experiences in life. For instance, having empathy and kindness can make us more compassionate and understanding towards others, while being brave and resilient can help us overcome challenges and obstacles. Research has shown that these traits are shaped by our environment, upbringing, and personal experiences. For example, someone who has grown up in a nurturing and supportive environment is more likely to develop empathy and kindness, while someone who has faced adversity and challenges may develop resilience and determination.

Influential people throughout history have also inspired the development of certain character traits. For instance, Nelson Mandela's perseverance and dedication to fighting against injustice have inspired many to stand up for what they believe in and fight for what is right. Similarly, Malala Yousafzai's courage and determination in the face of adversity have inspired many to speak out against injustice and fight for the rights of others. These individuals have shown us that with hard work and determination, we can develop character traits that can help us make a positive impact on the world.

However, kids and adults differ in their approach to developing character traits. Children are still learning and developing their traits, and they may need more guidance and support from adults. Adults, on the other hand, may have a more established set of traits and may be more focused on refining and improving them. Additionally, adults may be more aware of the consequences of choosing certain character traits, and they may be more motivated to develop traits that will help",1,llama2_chat,3
"Knowledge vs. Imagination: Why Knowledge is the Key to Success

As an 8th grader, I believe that knowledge is more important than imagination. While imagination can be a powerful tool for creativity and innovation, knowledge provides the foundation upon which imagination can build upon. Without a solid understanding of the world around us, our imaginations can only take us so far.

First and foremost, knowledge is essential for problem-solving. Imagination can help us come up with creative solutions to problems, but without a basic understanding of how things work, those solutions are often impractical or unrealistic. For example, imagine a person who has never studied physics trying to design a new type of car. While they may have a vivid imagination, they wouldn't know how to make the car run, how to make it safe, or how to mass produce it. In contrast, someone with a strong knowledge of physics could design a car that is both innovative and practical.

Moreover, knowledge is necessary for personal growth and development. Without a basic understanding of the world, we are limited in our ability to make informed decisions and take action towards our goals. For instance, if a person has no knowledge of financial literacy, they may be unable to manage their money effectively, leading to financial struggles and missed opportunities. On the other hand, someone with a strong knowledge of personal finance can make smart investments, save for the future, and achieve their financial goals.

Furthermore, knowledge is the key to success in any field. Whether it's medicine, engineering, or business, having a strong foundation of knowledge is essential for achieving excellence. A doctor without a solid understanding of human anatomy and disease cannot provide adequate care for their patients. An engineer without knowledge of physics and mathematics cannot design safe and efficient structures. And a business owner without knowledge of economics and marketing cannot build a successful company.

In conclusion, while imagination can be a valuable tool for creativity, knowledge is the foundation upon which imagination can build upon. Without a solid understanding of the world around us, our imaginations are limited in their potential. Therefore, I argue that knowledge is more important than imagination, as it provides the key to problem-solving, personal growth, and success in any field.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 Today, I'm gonna write about something that I think is super important for all of us, and that's having a positive attitude! 🌞

So, you know how sometimes things can get really tough and stressful? Like, your math teacher gives you a ton of homework, or your best friend gets mad at you, or you're feeling really nervous about that big test coming up? 🤯 Yeah, those are the times when it's easy to get all down and out, and feel like everything is just too hard. 😔

But here's the thing: having a positive attitude can totally change all of that! 🔥 When you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to see the good in things, and to find ways to make things easier and more manageable. Like, instead of freaking out about that math homework, you can try to see it as a fun challenge that you can learn from. Or, instead of getting mad at your friend, you can try to talk things out and find a solution that works for both of you. 🤝

And here's the cool thing: having a positive attitude doesn't just make things easier in the moment – it can also help you in the long run! 🔜 Like, when you're faced with tough situations, you'll be more likely to handle them with confidence and grace, and to come out on top. You'll also be more likely to make good choices and to stay motivated, even when things get tough. 💪

So, how can you develop a positive attitude? 🤔 Well, one thing you can do is to try to focus on the good things in your life, and to be grateful for them. Like, instead of complaining about how hard school is, try to think about how cool it is that you're learning new things and growing as a person. 🧠 And, instead of getting mad at someone, try to find a way to forgive them and move on. 💕

"Research has shown that offering career-specific courses in high school can be incredibly beneficial for students’ futures. Such courses can provide them with an opportunity to explore various career paths while they are still in high school, giving them the ability to make better informed decisions and career decisions in light of their individual passions and skill sets. Furthermore, offering such courses can also equip students with the essential skills necessary for success in their future profession, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. 

Nevertheless, there are some drawbacks to having career courses in high school. For one, career courses may not always fit into the overall curriculum within a school system. Additionally, not all students may be able to access these courses due to financial or other constraints. Finally, career courses may prove to be overly specialized or restrict students’ exploration of different paths, thus leaving some students unprepared for future opportunities that may arise.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Sir Winston Churchill remains a powerful example of perseverance and success despite failure. Churchill was a British statesman most famously known for his leadership during WW2. However, his successes as a politician did not come easy. Despite experiencing a multitude of failures early in his life, he refused to give in and kept pushing himself forward, ultimately becoming one of Britain's most legendary figures. His famous quote, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”, emphasizes the importance of not giving up in the face of difficulty, instead persevering and striving for success.

To understand better how to continue striving in the face of repeated failure, let’s examine a hypothetical scenario. A student is struggling to pass a difficult college course and has already failed the course four times. It would be easy for the student to become disheartened and give up, especially with the overwhelming challenge of preparing for and taking yet another exam. But that student must remember Churchill’s advice and take courage in the knowledge that failure can lead to success if it is met with dedication and consistency. 

To support not losing enthusiasm after failure, an essay should emphasize that life is full of challenges and how failure is inextricably linked to success. Point out the detrimental mental, emotional, and physical effects of allowing the persistence of failure to cause someone to give up. Remind readers that a success story is more than just endings and that the path to success is likely to be filled with setbacks. Finally, encourage readers that re-centering and recalibrating after failure is a normal part of life and essential for anyone seeking to reach their goals. 

On a personal or professional level, it is important to remain consistent and not give up after failure. Through researching the achievements of Winston Churchill and exploring a hypothetical scenario, it has become clear that the courage to continue despite failure is the only way to experience lasting success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an 8th grader, I find the idea of graduating from high school in three years to be both intriguing and challenging. After conducting research and evaluating the benefits and drawbacks, I have come to the conclusion that it is feasible to graduate early, but it's crucial to consider the potential implications.

On the one hand, graduating from high school in three years can have several benefits. Firstly, it can save students and their families money on tuition fees and other expenses associated with attending college. Additionally, early graduates can start their careers earlier, which can give them a head start in life. Furthermore, they can explore their interests and passions without feeling rushed to finish high school.

On the other hand, there are also several drawbacks to consider. For instance, students who graduate early may miss out on important social interactions and experiences that are crucial for their personal and emotional development. They may also struggle to adapt to the faster pace of college courses, leading to academic difficulties. Moreover, early graduation can limit students' opportunities for extracurricular activities and leadership roles, which can impact their college applications and future career prospects.

One way to mitigate these drawbacks is by taking elective classes that align with students' interests and passions. These classes can help students develop their creativity and skills, making them more successful in their future endeavors. For example, a student interested in photography can take a photography class to develop their skills and create a portfolio to showcase their work. Similarly, a student interested in business can take a entrepreneurship class to learn how to start and run their own business.

Another important factor to consider is the impact of early graduation on knowledge retention. While graduating early can save time and money, it can also lead to a lack of retention of knowledge. Students who graduate early may struggle to keep up with the faster pace of college courses, leading to lower grades and academic difficulties. Therefore, it's crucial for early graduates to continue to challenge themselves and engage in activities that promote knowledge retention.

Lastly, graduating from high school in three years can have significant implications for postsecondary studies and finding a job. While some colleges and universities may",1,llama2_chat,3
"Pianos and saxophones are two of the most widely-used instruments in the world of music. With a piano, you can play a broad range of music, including classical, jazz, pop, rock, blues, and more. As for saxophones, their sound can be heard in all sorts of genres, including jazz, blues, rock, funk, Latin, reggae, and more. 

Guitars come in several varieties, most notably acoustic, distorted, and clean. An acoustic guitar has a signature warm and mellow sound, and is best-suited for acoustic and folk music. Distorted guitars are often used in progressive and heavy metal music for a heavier sound, with electric guitar solos often using this type of guitar. Lastly, clean guitars are favored by jazz, folk, and country musicians for their full, natural sound.

The amount of time it takes to learn an instrument will depend on the individual's level of commitment and dedication. Someone who practices regularly can learn to play each instrument quite quickly, while others might take longer. It's also important to note that not everyone learns at the same rate. 

In conclusion, each of these three instruments has its own set of sounds and styles that make it distinct. With the right practice and dedication, any musician can master all of these instruments and use them to create their own unique music.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"A four-day work week with ten hours at school each day is a topic that has been widely debated in recent years. While some people argue that it would be a great benefit to students, others believe that it would be detrimental. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of a four-day work week with ten hours at school each day.

One of the main advantages of a four-day work week is that it would provide students with more time to focus on their studies. With ten hours at school each day, students would have more time to complete their assignments, prepare for exams, and engage in extracurricular activities. This would allow them to better balance their academic and personal lives, which is crucial for their overall well-being. Additionally, a four-day work week would give students more time to spend with their families and friends, which is important for maintaining healthy relationships.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to a four-day work week. One of the main concerns is that it would require students to work longer hours each day in order to complete the same amount of work as they currently do in a five-day work week. This could lead to increased stress and burnout for students, as well as a decrease in the quality of their work. Additionally, a four-day work week could lead to a decrease in the number of extracurricular activities that students participate in, as they would have less time to devote to these activities.

In conclusion, a four-day work week with ten hours at school each day has both pros and cons. While it would provide students with more time to focus on their studies and maintain healthy relationships, it could also lead to increased stress and burnout, as well as a decrease in the number of extracurricular activities that students participate in. Ultimately, it is up to educators, parents, and students to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of a four-day work week and determine whether it would be a good fit for their particular situation.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Title: Mandatory Community Service for Students: Pros and Cons

Introduction:
Community service has been a hot topic in education for quite some time now. Some argue that it's a great way to instill a sense of social responsibility in students, while others claim it's a waste of time. As an 8th grader, I believe that mandatory community service for students is a great idea. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of implementing such a policy and argue in favor of it.

Pros:

1. Community Service Teaches Valuable Life Skills: Community service projects teach students important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. By participating in these projects, students learn how to work together towards a common goal, which is an essential skill in any profession.
2. Encourages Social Responsibility: Community service projects also encourage students to be socially responsible and aware of the issues affecting their communities. By participating in these projects, students learn about the importance of giving back to the community and making a positive impact.
3. Improves Academic Performance: Studies have shown that students who participate in community service projects tend to perform better academically. This is because community service projects help students develop critical thinking skills, which are essential for academic success.
4. Provides Opportunities for Personal Growth: Community service projects provide students with opportunities to step out of their comfort zones and try new things. This can help students develop their confidence and self-esteem, which are essential for personal growth.

Cons:

1. Time Constraints: Many students have busy schedules, and adding mandatory community service can be challenging. This can lead to conflicts with other extracurricular activities or even academic responsibilities.
2. Lack of Student Interest: Some students may not be interested in community service projects, which can make it difficult to get them involved. This can lead to a lack of participation and a decrease in the overall impact of the projects.
3. Safety Concerns: Some community service projects may involve physical labor or exposure to dangerous situations. This can raise safety concerns, especially for younger students.

Hey there, it's me, [Your Name], and I'm super excited to write about my goal of becoming a professional soccer player. I know, I know, it's not the most conventional dream for an 8th grader, but hey, I'm going big or going home! 😅

So, here's my plan: I'm going to practice, practice, practice! I'll join a travel soccer team and play in tournaments all over the state. I'll also work on my weaknesses, like my lack of speed and agility, by doing exercises and drills at home. I'll even watch videos of professional soccer players to learn new tricks and strategies.

But, I know it won't be easy. There are a lot of talented players out there, and I'll have to work hard to stand out. I might face criticism and setbacks, but I won't let that discourage me. I'll use the advice of successful soccer players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to stay motivated. They never gave up on their dreams, and I won't either!

If I achieve my goal, it will be amazing! I'll get to play the sport I love for a living, travel to different countries, and meet new people. I'll also be setting an example for other kids who might be interested in soccer but don't think they can make it to the pros.

"As an 8th grade student, I think it's pretty cool that I get to write an essay about something that's super relevant to my life – my phone! 😅 But for real, I think it's pretty important to talk about whether or not we should be able to bring our phones to school.

So, let's start with the pros. I think it's pretty obvious that having our phones with us during lunch and free time can be really helpful. Like, if we're bored or need to get something from the office, we can just grab our phones and check our messages or play a game. It's also way easier to communicate with our friends when we're in different classes or at different lunch tables. And let's be real, sometimes we just need to scroll through TikTok to relax. 😂

But, there are also some cons to bringing phones to school. Some people might get distracted and start playing games or scrolling through social media instead of paying attention in class. And if we're not careful, we might get cyberbullied or see things that are totally not cool. Plus, if we're not careful, we might end up wasting a lot of time on our phones instead of doing our schoolwork.

So, here's where things get interesting. Some people think we should be able to have our phones during lunch and free time as long as we turn them off while learning. They think it's important for us to be able to communicate with our friends and relax, but also to stay focused when it matters most. But other people think it's just too risky, and that we might get too distracted and not learn anything.

Personally, I think it's a pretty tough call. I mean, I love my phone and I know it's super useful, but I also don't want to get distracted from my schoolwork. I think it would be cool if we could have our phones during lunch and free time, but only if we promise to use them responsibly. Like, we could use them to communicate with our friends or relax, but not to play games or scroll through social media.

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that working alone has its advantages and disadvantages compared to working in groups. While working in groups can be beneficial in terms of collaboration and communication, working alone can be more beneficial in terms of time management, focus, and self-challenging.

When working alone, students have complete control over their time and work at their own pace. They can prioritize their tasks and allocate their time more efficiently, which can lead to better time management. Additionally, working alone allows students to focus on their work without distractions from other group members. This can lead to better focus and productivity.

Working alone also allows students to challenge themselves and take responsibility for their work. When working in a group, students may rely too heavily on their group members, which can lead to a lack of self-challenging. Working alone requires students to take ownership of their work and push themselves to achieve their goals.

However, working alone can also have its disadvantages. Students may feel isolated and lonely, which can negatively impact their mental health. Additionally, working alone may not provide the same level of collaboration and communication as working in a group. This can limit the exchange of ideas and make it more difficult to solve complex problems.

In conclusion, working alone has its advantages and disadvantages compared to working in groups. While working alone can be beneficial in terms of time management, focus, and self-challenging, it can also be isolating and limit collaboration.

"Working independently and working in a group are two different approaches to completing a school project. Each approach has its own benefits, and the choice between the two ultimately depends on the individual's learning style and preferences.

Working independently allows students to have complete control over their project. They can work at their own pace, choose their own methods, and make their own decisions. This can be beneficial for students who prefer to work alone, as they can focus on their own ideas and work without distraction. Additionally, working independently can help students develop self-discipline and time management skills, as they must be responsible for their own progress.

On the other hand, working in a group can provide a collaborative environment where students can share ideas and work together to achieve a common goal. This can be beneficial for students who prefer to work with others, as they can learn from their peers and gain different perspectives on the project. Additionally, working in a group can help students develop communication and leadership skills, as they must work together to make decisions and delegate tasks.

Ultimately, the choice between working independently and working in a group depends on the individual's learning style and preferences. Some students may prefer to work alone, while others may thrive in a collaborative environment. It is important for students to consider their own strengths and weaknesses when deciding which approach to take, and to choose the approach that will allow them to achieve their goals and learn the most from the project.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1

Not only do these people have positive attitudes to drive them, but they have also learned to stay committed to their goals, no matter how difficult or lengthy the journey may be. 

Grades, school, and homework are also crucial elements in the pursuit of success. Individuals who have reached success in their lives often attribute this success to having done well in school and having put in hard work and dedication to their studies. They internalized their motivation to do better, working hard to acheive academic excellence. 

This proves that attitude and commitment play a major role in success. Having a positive outlook can also inspire others to strive for their own goals. When people see someone succeeding, it can spark the motivation they need to pursue their dreams and push their limits. Self-motivation is a trait that can have a significant impact on a person's success in life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

Summer Project Idea: Exploring Animal Behavior and Wound Care

Hey there! As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to choose a summer project that combines two of my favorite things: animals and science! For my project, I want to focus on animal behavior and discovering ways to treat open wounds or reduce pollution. I think this is a super important topic because animals play a huge role in our ecosystem, and their behavior can tell us a lot about the health of our planet. Plus, learning how to treat wounds and reduce pollution can help us help animals and people too!

So, here's what I want to do: I want to observe and study the behavior of different animals in their natural habitats. I'll start by doing some research on the internet and in books to learn about different animal species and their behavior. Then, I'll head out to the local park or nature reserve to see these animals up close and personal. I'll take notes on what I see and try to identify patterns in their behavior. For example, I might notice that a certain species of bird only visits a certain type of tree, or that a group of squirrels always seems to gather in the same spot.

Next, I want to explore ways to treat open wounds and reduce pollution. I'll look into different natural remedies and treatments that can help heal wounds, like using neem oil or aloe vera. I'll also investigate ways to reduce pollution, like using reusable bags and water bottles, or planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide. I'll test out these remedies and treatments and see how well they work in real life.

Finally, I want to share my findings with others! I'll create a presentation or video to show my classmates and teachers, so they can learn about the importance of animal behavior and how to help the environment. I might even create a brochure or flyer to distribute in my community, so more people can get involved.

Overall, my summer project is all about exploring the fascinating world of animal behavior and discovering ways to help the environment. I'm so excited to get started and",1,llama2_chat,3
"After school activities offer advantages such as providing an engaging environment with a sense of camaraderie, fostering the development of important social skills, and enhancing physical health. Additionally, students in after school activities often benefit from close relationships with mentors and coaches and have the potential to be part of a team. However, after school activities can also have disadvantages. For instance, students may be exposed to activities that are not consistent with school values and beliefs, and the amount of time devoted to such activities may interfere with the student’s ability to complete their homework in a timely manner. 

Doing homework at home has its own advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, a student is able to work independently and in a familiar environment, where they may feel more comfortable and secure. On the other hand, it can be hard to remain focused and stay on task without the structure and support of an after school program. Additionally, the lack of peer interactions and motivation in an unstructured setting can lead to a student becoming easily distracted.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"In recent years, educational gaming and various activities have become increasingly popular in the education system.

Additionally, math competitions, chess tournaments, and science fairs provide students with an opportunity to use their knowledge in a competitive environment, gain greater awareness of mathematics, and engage in the exploration of science. 

The benefits of learning through educational gaming and activities are immense. They can help to foster an interest in knowledge, help students build self-esteem, collaborate, and gain social skills. Educational gaming can be used to teach various topics in a fun and engaging way that is both stimulating and enjoyable. Moreover, activities such as competitions and science fairs provide students with the opportunity to develop better problem-solving strategies, deepen understanding, build confidence, and achieve better overall results. 

In conclusion, educational gaming and activities can have a significantly positive effect on student learning and development. Such activities can foster an interest in knowledge, help students gain problem-solving abilities, increase their confidence, and promote collaboration. In addition, they can provide students with the opportunity to gain greater awareness of mathematics and science, and foster greater creativity and innovation.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an average 8th grader, I have to say that technology has had a huge impact on our lives. It's like, everywhere we go, there are screens and gadgets that we can't seem to put down. And while it's really cool to have all this tech stuff, it's also starting to make us forget how to live life.

Like, have you ever been on a hike or a camping trip without your phone? It's like, super hard. You're like, ""Wait, how do I take a picture of this beautiful view? How do I check my Instagram? How do I text my friends?"" It's like, technology has made us so dependent on it that we forget how to just be in the moment.

And it's not just the hiking thing. It's like, even when we're just chillin' at home, we're always on our phones or tablets. We're not really present in the moment. We're not really talking to each other or interacting with each other. It's like, we're all just staring at screens all the time.

And that's not the only thing. Technology can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and depression. Like, if you're not getting enough likes on your Instagram posts, you start to feel like you're not good enough. Or if you're not getting enough followers, you start to feel like you're not popular enough. It's like, technology can make us feel really bad about ourselves.

But, you know what? Technology can also be really productive if we use it the right way. Like, if we use technology to learn new things, we can become smarter and more knowledgeable. Or if we use technology to connect with other people, we can make new friends and learn about different cultures.

And, you know what else? Technology can have a big impact on our physical and mental health. Like, if we spend too much time on our phones or computers, it can give us eye strain and headaches. And if we're always connected to technology, it can make us feel anxious and stressed out. So, it's important to balance technology use with other activities that are good",1,llama2_chat,2
"Title: The Double-Edged Sword of False Praise and Hope

As an 8th grader, I've noticed how easily false praise and hope can manipulate our self-esteem and work ethic. On one hand, receiving excessive praise can make us feel invincible and lazy, while false hope can lead to a lack of motivation. It's important to recognize the impact of these factors on our self-esteem and develop strategies to build and maintain it in a healthy way.

False praise can be damaging to our self-esteem because it creates unrealistic expectations. When we're constantly told we're the best or the smartest, we start to believe it, even when we're not. This can lead to a sense of complacency and a lack of effort in our work. We might feel like we don't need to try hard because we're already perfect, and this can result in mediocre performance. On the other hand, false hope can also be detrimental to our self-esteem. When we're told things will be easy or that we'll achieve great things without putting in the effort, we start to doubt our abilities. We might feel like we're not good enough or that we'll never reach our goals, leading to a lack of motivation and a decrease in self-esteem.

So, how can we build and maintain healthy self-esteem? The key is to focus on our achievements and hard work. When we work towards something and achieve it, we feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This boosts our self-esteem and motivates us to keep pushing ourselves. It's important to set realistic goals and recognize our progress towards them. By doing so, we can develop a growth mindset and understand that success is not just based on natural talent or luck, but on our effort and dedication.

In conclusion, false praise and hope can have a negative impact on our self-esteem and work ethic. It's important to be aware of these factors and develop strategies to build and maintain healthy self-esteem. By focusing on our achievements and hard work, we can develop a sense of pride and motivation that will help us reach our full potential. So, let",1,llama2_chat,3
"Choosing a career at a young age can offer certain benefits, such as increased focus and determination, as well as the opportunity to plan accordingly for future milestones. Students in high school should take advantage of the resources available to them to explore and discover potential career paths. Researching occupations, talking to individuals in the field, and attending workshops and programs are all viable options for identifying a career. Additionally, examining the stories and examples of others who have chosen their career paths can be exceptionally beneficial in providing insight and direction. 

Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide how and when to commit to a career. Despite the potential risks, devoting oneself to a field of study early on may grant additional time to research and develop the skills that are necessary for success. Committing to a career at a young age can grant more time to specialize in a chosen field, providing a competitive advantage along the way.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

So, I know distance learning is becoming super popular these days, but I think it's way better to go to public school. Don't get me wrong, I know it's way easier to cheat when you're at home, but like, who wants to cheat?  Plus, you don't get to hang out with your friends and stuff. And let's be real, sometimes you need a little bit of motivation to get through those super long math problems. 

But, like, when you're at public school, you get to see your friends and teachers in person!  You can ask them questions and get help when you need it, and you can actually see their faces and stuff. It's way better than just staring at a screen all day.  And don't even get me started on the social interactions. You can make new friends and learn how to work with people in a group.

But, like, there are some cons to public school too.  Sometimes it can be really hard to focus and pay attention, especially if you're in a big class. And if you're not really motivated, it can be easy to fall behind.  But, like, I think the pros way outweigh the cons. 

So, like, overall, I think public school is way better than distance learning.  It's just more fun and you get to learn stuff in a more interactive way.

"Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, so bear with me on this essay! 😅

The ""four-day school week"" idea has been gaining traction lately, with some schools and districts experimenting with this schedule. While it might seem like a dream come true to have an extra day off each week, there are both pros and cons to consider.

On the plus side, a shorter school week could potentially reduce stress on students. Let's face it, school can be super stressful, especially with piles of homework, exams, and extracurricular activities. Having an extra day off could give us some much-needed time to relax and recharge. Plus, it might make it easier for students who have part-time jobs or other commitments to balance their schedules.

Another benefit could be the opportunity for students to pursue other interests and activities. With an extra day off, we could dedicate more time to hobbies, sports, or volunteering. This could help us develop new skills, make new friends, and become more well-rounded individuals.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. One of the main concerns is the lack of time for learning. With only four days in the classroom, we might not be able to cover as much material as we would with a traditional five-day week. This could impact our academic success, particularly in subjects like math and science, where hands-on learning and repetition are crucial.

Moreover, a shorter school week might also limit the opportunities for social interaction. School is more than just learning – it's also about making friends, joining clubs, and participating in school events. With fewer days in the classroom, we might miss out on important social experiences that help us develop important life skills.

Lastly, there's the question of how a four-day school week would impact our future success. While having more time for extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's also important to have a solid foundation in academics. If we don't get enough time in the classroom, we might struggle to keep up with college-level coursework or enter the workforce with the necessary skills.

"The year-round school year has been a topic of debate for many years. Some argue that it would be beneficial for students, while others believe it would have negative effects. In this essay, I will discuss the year-round school year argument, the negatives of a year-round school year, the positives of summer break, and alternatives to the year-round school year.

One argument for a year-round school year is that it would provide students with more opportunities to learn and grow. With more time in the school year, students could take more classes, participate in more extracurricular activities, and have more time to catch up on any material they may have fallen behind on. This could lead to better academic performance and a more well-rounded education for students.

However, there are also several negatives to a year-round school year. One major concern is the potential for burnout among students and teachers. With more time in the school year, students and teachers may become overwhelmed and stressed, leading to a decline in academic performance and overall well-being. Additionally, a year-round school year could lead to a decrease in summer enrollment, as families may choose to take their children out of school during the summer months.

Another argument for the year-round school year is that it would provide students with more opportunities to travel and explore new cultures. With more time off during the school year, students could take trips and see new places, which could broaden their horizons and enhance their learning experiences.

On the other hand, many people believe that the summer break is an important time for students to rest and recharge. During the summer, students can take a break from the rigors of school and spend time with family and friends. This time can be used to catch up on any material that may have been missed during the school year, and to pursue hobbies and interests that may not have been possible during the school year.

Finally, there are several alternatives to the year-round school year that may be worth considering. For example, some schools have implemented a ""flipped"" schedule, where students attend class in the morning and do homework in the evening. This schedule can provide students with more time to pursue extracurricular activities and to catch up on any material they may have fallen behind on.

"Ummm, hey there!  So, like, online learning is pretty cool and all, but there are some, uh, challenges that come with it.  Like, slow internet, distractions, and limited time.  It's, like, super frustrating when you're trying to learn something new, but the internet keeps buffering or your dog keeps barking. 

First off, slow internet.  It's like, how are we supposed to learn anything when the videos keep buffering or the pages keep loading?  It's like, I get it, the internet is busy and all, but come on!  I need to learn this stuff, not binge-watch Netflix.  And don't even get me started on when the teacher is trying to explain something and the internet cuts out.  It's like, hello, can you please just give us the information already?! 

And then there's distractions.  Like, I know I'm not the only one who gets easily distracted.  My cat is always trying to cuddle or my sibling is always asking for something.  It's like, I know I'm supposed to be learning, but oh, look, a cat!  And don't even get me started on social media.  It's like, I know I'm supposed to be focusing on my schoolwork, but I just saw a funny meme and now I'm wasting time. 

And lastly, limited time.  It's like, I know I have a lot of other stuff to do, like sports or clubs or hanging out with friends.  It's like, I want to learn this stuff, but I also don't want to spend all my time on the computer.  I mean, I guess that's what weekends are for",1,llama2_chat,1
"School policies should be designed to encourage students to maximize their potential and strive for success. Requiring a B average for students to participate in sports and activities is not only counterintuitive to this goal, but it can also have a detrimental effect on student morale and motivation. 

Forcing students to maintain a B average in order to participate in extra-curricular activities does not necessarily ensure academic success. It can actually help create an atmosphere of exclusion, wherein students do not feel like they have the same opportunities or privileges as those around them. This can lead to frustration and feelings of inadequacy, as students start to believe that they must achieve a certain grade average to ""deserve"" recognition and reward.

Additionally, a B average requirement serves as a disincentive for many students. Not only does it discourage participation, it can also discourage students from attempting to join in the first place. Instead of giving them the opportunity to grow and learn, it simply sets an arbitrary benchmark that some may struggle to reach. 

Rather than having a B average policy, schools should focus on creating an environment where students are motivated to learn, grow, and develop their hobbies and interests. Activities should be inclusive and easily accessible. Education should be seen as the ultimate goal, and students need to be given the freedom to follow their passions and explore different options. A no-grades policy is the best way to ensure this happens.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research the different topics studied in the sciences, like biology, chemistry, physics, and astronomy. And let me tell you, there's a lot to learn! 

First off, I found out that scientists use all sorts of cool tools and methods to study these topics. Like, did you know that biologists use microscopes to examine tiny things like cells and bacteria? And chemists use things called spectroscopes to study the properties of chemicals. 

But wait, there's more! I also learned about this fancy term called ""scientific notation."" It's like a special way of writing numbers that helps scientists measure really big or really small things. Like, instead of writing a number like 123,456,789, they can write it as 1.23456789 x 10^9. 

And let's not forget about the definition of ""scintilla."" It means the smallest amount of something, like the tiniest spark of an idea. 

But science isn't just about learning cool facts and terms. It's also super important for our day-to-day lives. Like, did you know that scientists are working on developing new medicines to cure diseases? Or that they're trying to find ways to make our air and water cleaner? 

Now, I know some people might think that becoming a science expert takes forever, but it's actually not that long. Like, depending on what you want to study, you can become an expert in just a few years. 

But, there are some challenges too. Like, sometimes scientists have to deal with things like fake news and people not believing in science. 

Lastly, I found out that chain changes and bevels have a big impact in science. Chain changes are like small changes that can lead to big changes, and bevels are like special tools that help scientists make those changes.

First of all, let's talk about the benefits. Joining something outside of school can help us learn new skills, like teamwork, communication, and time management. It's also a great way to make new friends and be part of a community. Plus, it looks good on college apps, right? 

But, I get that some people might be like, ""Ugh, sports are so lame,"" or ""I'm not into that stuff."" And that's totally fine! Everyone's got their own thing, and if you're not into sports, that's okay. Maybe you could join a drama club or a book club or something. The point is, there's something out there for everyone.

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what if I'm not good at it?"" Or, ""What if I get hurt?"" And those are valid concerns, for sure. But, like, life is all about trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone, you know? You might surprise yourself and find something you're actually really good at! And if you do get hurt, it's not the end of the world. You can always try again next season or join something else.

So, in conclusion, I think it's a pretty good idea for all of us to try to join something outside of school. It's a great way to learn new skills, make new friends, and have some fun. Of course, it's not for everyone, but I think it's definitely worth a shot. Thanks for listening, Mrs. Johnson!",1,llama2_chat,1
"Homeschooling: The Pros and Cons of Personalized Learning

As an 8th grader, I have been exposed to both homeschooling and public schooling, and I have to say that homeschooling has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of homeschooling and how it differs from studying at a public school.

One of the biggest advantages of homeschooling is the ability to personalize the learning experience. Homeschooling allows parents to tailor their child's education to their individual needs, interests, and learning style. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may be struggling in a traditional classroom setting or who have special needs. Homeschooling also provides an opportunity for students to learn at their own pace, which can help them to better retain information and build confidence in their abilities.

Another advantage of homeschooling is the lack of distractions that can be present in a traditional classroom. Homeschooled students can learn in a quiet and comfortable environment, which can help them to focus and retain information better. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are easily distracted or who have difficulty paying attention in a noisy classroom.

However, there are also some disadvantages to homeschooling. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of social interaction. Homeschooled students may not have as many opportunities to interact with other students and build social skills, which can be important for developing emotional intelligence and social awareness. Homeschooling can also limit the opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities and sports, which can be important for building character and developing teamwork skills.

Another disadvantage of homeschooling is the potential for a lack of structure and accountability. Without the structure of a traditional school, it can be easy for homeschooling parents to fall behind in their child's education or to fail to provide adequate support and resources. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement on the part of the student, which can negatively impact their academic performance.

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay on the benefits of providing students with healthy meals during school:

Hey, guys! Today I'm gonna talk about why it's super important for schools to provide healthy meals for us students. I know, I know, you're probably thinking, ""Ugh, do we really have to eat that stuff?"" But trust me, it's actually really important!

First of all, eating healthy meals at school can help us focus better in class. When we're stuffed with junk food, we might feel drowsy and distracted, which can make it hard to pay attention to what the teacher is saying. But when we eat nutritious food, we feel more energized and alert, which makes it easier to learn stuff. Plus, who wants to sit through a whole class period feeling like they're gonna fall asleep? Not me, that's for sure!

Another reason why healthy meals are important is that they can help us maintain good health. When we eat foods that are high in sugar and salt, it can lead to problems like obesity and diabetes. And let's be real, no one wants to be the kid who's always getting picked on because they're too heavy. So by providing healthy meals, schools can help us avoid these kinds of problems and stay healthy overall.

Also, eating healthy meals at school can help us make better choices when we're at home. When we get used to eating nutritious food at school, we're more likely to make the same choices at home. And let's be real, it's way easier to grab a bag of chips or a slice of pizza than it is to make a salad or some other healthy food. So by providing healthy meals at school, we can learn how to make better choices and eat healthier overall.

Finally, providing healthy meals at school can help us feel more included and supported. When we're eating healthy food, we feel like we're part of a community that cares about our well-being. And let's be real, who doesn't want to feel like they're part of a community that",1,llama2_chat,0
"The wealth of benefits accompanying an active lifestyle and spending time outdoors is well-documented. From strengthened muscles to an increased ability to cope with stress, participating in sports offers tremendous benefits to our health. Through physical activities such as walking, climbing, swimming, or playing sports, our bodies are provided with an opportunity to move and to breathe. We become stronger and better conditioned. Our mental state is also improved. 

Furthermore, limiting our technology usage creates an opportunity for families to become closer. Without the distraction of games, screens, and social media, family members can focus more on one another and create more meaningful connections. The quality time spent together outside in nature increases a sense of well-being and can foster healthier relationships. 

In conclusion, it is clear that healthy physical activities and spending time away from technology are necessary for the overall well-being of our bodies and our minds. To promote a stronger family life, individuals and families should incorporate healthy physical activities into their lifestyles and limit their tech usage to build deeper relationships.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As a student, I believe that requiring students to maintain a grade C average to participate in extracurricular activities is a wise decision. In my opinion, students should understand that there is a direct correlation between their academic performance and their ability to participate in activities outside of the classroom. This gracefully encourages students to strive to do their best in school, and understand the importance of working hard to achieve their goals. 

Furthermore, this requirement allows the school to ensure that students can handle the extra workload associated with extracurricular activities, while still balancing their academic responsibilities. Ensuring this balance will lead to increased student success, as well as fewer overwhelmed and stressed students. It is crucial that students take the time to invest in their education and understand the importance of good grades, and this policy encourages them to make the effort. 

Overall, I believe this policy to require a grade C average is a beneficial change for the school activities. It raises the educational standards for our school, while motivating and inspiring students to make the most of their education.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

In contrast, my own view on failure is one of resilience and acceptance. I believe that failure should be embraced as an inherent part of one's journey towards success. I don't believe that failure is something that should bring shame or guilt, but rather something that should be viewed as an opportunity for growth and development. Furthermore, I believe that failure can be used to further one's learning, as we can always learn from our mistakes. Ultimately, failure should be accepted as an inevitable part of life, and the resilience to keep trying and trying again is the only true measure of success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

But if you have a good attitude, you're gonna be way more productive and you're gonna make work way more fun. Plus, it's way easier to get ahead in life when you're nice to people and you're always smiling. Trust me, I've seen it happen.

And it's not just work, attitude is also super important in school. Like, if you have a bad attitude, you're gonna struggle to learn and you're gonna get all B's and C's. But if you have a good attitude, you're gonna be way more motivated to learn and you're gonna get all A's and B's. Plus, it's way easier to make friends and stuff when you're nice to people and you're always smiling. Trust me, I've seen it happen.

But like, the most important place where attitude is important is at home. Like, if you have a bad attitude at home, you're gonna make everyone around you super uncomfortable and stuff. But if you have a good attitude at home, you're gonna be way more happy and you're gonna make everyone around you way more happy too. Plus, it's way easier to get along with your family and stuff when you're nice to them and you're always smiling. Trust me, I've seen it happen.

"As an average 8th grade student, I have to say that I find the prompt to be really interesting. In my opinion, there are many ways to influence someone without using technology, Google translator, or YouTube. While these tools can be useful in some situations, they are not the only ways to make an impact on someone's thoughts or actions.

One way to influence someone without technology is through personal interactions and communication. For example, having a face-to-face conversation with someone can be much more effective in persuading them than sending them a message through a screen. This is because nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, can convey emotions and sincerity in a way that text messages cannot. Additionally, building a personal connection with someone can make them more likely to listen to and consider your perspective.

Another way to influence someone without technology is through shared experiences and common interests. For instance, if you and someone else have a common hobby or passion, you can use that as a way to connect with them and share your ideas. By finding common ground, you can build trust and credibility, which can make it easier to persuade them to see things from your perspective.

However, I do think that technology and other tools can also be useful in certain situations. For example, if you are trying to reach a large audience or spread awareness about an issue, using social media or other online platforms can be an effective way to do so. Additionally, technology can provide valuable information and resources that can help support your arguments.

In my opinion, the impact of examples vs. other ways of influencing depends on the situation and the audience. While personal interactions and shared experiences can be more effective in some cases, technology and other tools can be more useful in others. For example, if you are trying to reach a large audience or spread awareness about an issue, using social media or other online platforms can be more effective than trying to have personal conversations with each person individually.

Overall, I think that there are many ways to influence someone without using technology, Google translator, or YouTube. While these tools can be useful in certain situations, they are not the only ways to make an impact on someone's thoughts or actions. By using a combination of personal interactions, shared experiences, and technology, you can be more effective in your efforts to",1,llama2_chat,4

First of all, let's talk about the long summer break. It's like, super long. Like, 60 days long. And it's great for vacations and stuff, but it's also like, really long. And I know some kids might not have the opportunity to go on vacation or visit their grandparents or anything, so it's not like everyone's on the same page. 🤷‍♀️

But, if we had a 7-day break every 2 weeks, it would be way more manageable. Like, think about it. 2 weeks of school, then a week off to relax and recharge. And then 2 more weeks of school, then another week off. It's like, perfect! 😍

So, here are some possible benefits of this initiative:

1. Better grades: Studies show that students who get more breaks throughout the year tend to perform better academically. It's like, our brains need a break to absorb everything we learned, you know? 🤓
2. Less stress: I know I'm not the only one who feels stressed out during the last week of school before break. It's like, cramming all this work into a short amount of time, and it's just too much. But, with a 7-day break, we could finish our work and actually enjoy our time off instead of being stressed out. 😩
3. More opportunities for extracurriculars: If we had more breaks, we could join more extracurricular activities or clubs. Like, I'm really interested in coding, but I don't have time to join the club because we only have summer break. But, if we had more breaks, I could join the club and actually learn something! 💻
4. Better mental health: Taking breaks throughout the year can actually improve our mental health.",1,llama2_chat,1
"Excerpt: 
Winston Churchill famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” This quote encapsulates how failure, hope, and enthusiasm are all integral components in achieving success. When we face failure, hope and enthusiasm are the sparks that help us keep going and persevere in our journey. Without hope, it can be easy to give up when faced with failure. And without enthusiasm, hope can quickly turn into discouragement. By combining the two, we are able to face failure head-on and continue striving forward despite the setbacks. With an enthusiasm for the journey, failure is no longer a dead end but rather a learning opportunity. Hope keeps us believing that if we keep trying, we can eventually reach success. Together, hope, failure, and enthusiasm are the essential ingredients for success in life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Group Work vs. Individual Work: Which is More Beneficial?

As an 8th grader, I have experienced both group work and individual work in various subjects, and I must say that both have their pros and cons. At first, I thought group work was the way to go, but after reflecting on my experiences, I have come to realize that individual work has its advantages too.

One of the biggest pros of group work is the ability to collaborate and share ideas. When working in a group, we can bounce ideas off each other and come up with something much better than what we could have produced alone. For example, in our science class, we recently worked on a project where we had to design and build a bridge using different materials. By working in a group, we were able to come up with a more creative and sturdy design than if we were working alone.

Another advantage of group work is the opportunity to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. When we work together, we can recognize what each person is good at and delegate tasks accordingly. For instance, in our math class, we worked on a project where we had to solve a complex problem. By working in a group, we were able to divide the task into smaller parts and use each person's strengths to solve it.

However, there are also some cons to group work. One of the biggest cons is the potential for conflict. When we work in a group, there is always the possibility of disagreements and misunderstandings. For example, in our language arts class, we worked on a project where we had to write a story together. However, some group members had different ideas about how the story should be written, which led to conflicts and delays.

On the other hand, there are also some pros to individual work. One of the biggest advantages is the ability to work at one's own pace. When we work alone, we can take the time we need to understand the material and complete the task without feeling rushed. For instance, in our history class, we worked on a project where we had to create a timeline of important events. By working alone, I was able to take my time and make sure I included all the necessary details.

Another advantage of individual work is the ability to take ownership of the work. When we",1,llama2_chat,4
"Poverty, depression, relationships, need, and peer pressure are all external factors that can have a profound effect on someone’s behavior over time. Many people turn to vices in an effort to escape from a difficult situation. For example, children born into poverty may lose hope in life, resulting in destructive behavioral trends such as addiction or criminal activities. Similarly, depressed individuals may use drugs or alcohol as a means of coping with their condition. 

Relationships can also impact a person’s behavior. Many people in abusive relationships may suffer from low self-esteem, leading to compromised decision-making or reckless and dangerous actions. Peer pressure can also be a powerful influence, particularly among young people. Teens often feel obligated to conform to their peers’ behaviors, even if those behaviors are dangerous or wrong. 

People are strongly affected by the external forces around them. While the aforementioned factors can lead to negative behavior, it is important to remember that no one is predestined to a life of destruction. It is never too late to take control of one’s behavior and seek out positive influences that will lead to a more productive life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an 8th grade student, I have been asked to research the pros and cons of allowing phones in classrooms for educational purposes. After conducting thorough research and evaluating the arguments for and against, I strongly believe that students should not have phones in classrooms.

One of the main arguments against allowing phones in classrooms is that it can be a distraction. Students may use their phones to scroll through social media, play games, or text their friends instead of paying attention to the lesson. According to a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, students who use their phones during class time are more likely to have lower grades and lower standardized test scores compared to those who do not (NCES, 2020). This is because phones can take away from the learning experience and make it harder for students to focus.

Another argument against allowing phones in classrooms is that it can lead to cyberbullying and online harassment. Students may use their phones to bully or harass their peers, which can create a toxic learning environment. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 59% of teens have experienced online bullying, and 43% have experienced it in the past year (Pew, 2020). By allowing phones in classrooms, we are putting students at risk of being bullied or harassed, which can negatively impact their mental health and academic performance.

Furthermore, allowing phones in classrooms can also lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction. Students may use their phones to communicate with their peers instead of engaging in class discussions or asking questions. According to a study conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles, students who use their phones during class time are less likely to participate in class discussions and have lower levels of social interaction (UCLA, 2018). This can lead to a lack of social skills and a decrease in overall academic performance.

In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to allowing phones in classrooms, such as increased access to educational resources and the ability to communicate with peers, the negative impact it can have on student learning outweighs these benefits. By not allowing phones in classrooms, we",1,llama2_chat,1
"Sure, here is an essay on why it is better to have summer break than have it in different times of the year, written as if it were a class assignment by an 8th grade student:

Summer break is the best time of the year for students. Having it in different times of the year, like during the fall or spring, would not be as good as having it during the summer. There are several reasons why.

First of all, if summer break were to be held at any other time of the year, students would not learn as much. Having long breaks in between school terms can make it harder for students to retain the information they learned in class. When you're on break, you're not learning new things or practicing what you already know, so it's easy to forget. But during the summer, students have plenty of time to relax and recharge, which helps them remember what they learned during the school year.

Another reason why summer break is better than having it in different times of the year is that students wouldn't have enough time with their family and friends. Summer break is the only time when students have a long break from school, and it's the perfect opportunity for them to spend time with their loved ones. They can go on trips, have sleepovers, and just hang out with their friends and family without having to worry about school work. If summer break were held at any other time of the year, students wouldn't have as much time to spend with their loved ones.

Additionally, having summer break in different times of the year would make it harder for students to do their work. For example, if summer break were held during the fall, students would have to balance their school work with their summer activities, which could be overwhelming. And if summer break were held during the spring, students would have to cram all their school work into a short amount of time before the break, which could lead to stress and poor grades. But during the summer, students have plenty of time to focus on their school work without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.

Finally, students would be more successful in school with summer break. When students have a long break from school, they come back refreshed and ready to learn. They're more motivated and focused, which can lead to better grades and better",1,llama2_chat,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a few mistakes along the journey does not mean failure, but rather a valuable learning opportunity. It is important to remember that mistakes are a natural part of the learning process, and they can be used to improve and achieve success.

One of the main reasons why mistakes are important is that they allow us to learn from our mistakes. When we make a mistake, we can analyze what went wrong and try to understand why. This process of reflection can help us to identify areas where we need to improve and develop strategies to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

Additionally, mistakes can also be used as a way to improve our performance. By identifying the areas where we need to improve, we can focus our efforts on developing the necessary skills and knowledge. This can lead to better performance and ultimately, success.

It is also important to remember that mistakes are not a reflection of our worth as individuals. Just because we make a mistake, it does not mean that we are a failure. Instead, it is an opportunity to learn and grow. In fact, many successful people have made mistakes in their lives, but they used those mistakes as a way to achieve their goals.

In conclusion, having a few mistakes along the journey does not mean failure, but rather a valuable learning opportunity. By analyzing our mistakes, focusing on improvement, and remembering that mistakes are not a reflection of our worth, we can use mistakes to achieve success and reach our full potential.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Technology has become an integral part of our lives, both in the workplace and in our personal lives. While the advances made possible by technology have been beneficial for many, they have also made it easier for us to become over-reliant on digital resources and lose our natural connection with people and our environment.

One of the biggest dangers of technology is its potential to negatively affect our physical and mental health. Prolonged exposure to blue light emitted by electronic devices can disrupt our natural circadian rhythms, causing a range of issues including insomnia, fatigue, and mood disturbances. Additionally, too much time spent on devices is linked to an increase in feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Technology can also impact our personal relationships. The prevalence of social media sites and messaging apps has given our phone screens priority over in-person interactions, preventing us from developing deeper connections with those closest to us.

Fortunately, technology does have the potential to be used responsibly. Limiting our exposure to blue light by avoiding screens at night, and keeping dedicated tech-free time is one way to ensure technology has limited negative impacts. Additionally, setting boundaries for yourself with regard to social media use can help foster healthier relationships. By recognizing the potential risks of technology and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure technology continues to be an asset to our lives.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Failure is like a spider trying to reach its goal. It keeps on trying and trying, even when it feels like it's not getting anywhere. But with determination, encouragement, enthusiasm, and hard work, that spider can turn its failure into success.

Take the spider for example. It might start out by trying to reach a certain spot on the wall, but it keeps getting knocked down. It might feel like it's never going to make it, but it doesn't give up. It keeps getting back up and trying again. And again. And again.

That's how it is with us too. We might fail at something, but if we keep trying, we can turn that failure into success. It's like that spider, keep climbing and climbing until it reaches its goal.

But it's not just about not giving up. It's also about being determined and enthusiastic. If we really want something, we have to be willing to work hard for it. It's like that spider, it keeps climbing even when it's hard. It doesn't let its struggles stop it from reaching its goal.

And it's important to have encouragement too. When we're trying to reach our goals, it can be easy to feel discouraged. But if we have people cheering us on, it can make all the difference. It's like that spider, it has friends and family cheering it on as it climbs.

So, in conclusion, failure is like that spider trying to reach its goal. It might feel like it's not getting anywhere, but with determination, encouragement, enthusiasm, and hard work, it can turn its failure into success. We just have to keep trying, be determined, and have people cheering us on. And who knows, we might just reach our goals like that spider did.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Hey there!  So, you wanna know about advice?  Well, let me tell ya, it's like... it's like having someone else's experience and knowledge to guide you through tough situations. Like, imagine you're trying to decide which video game to play, but you're not sure which one's gonna be the best. Your friend who's a total gaming pro can give you advice on which one's worth playing, and you can trust their opinion 'cause they've played 'em all! 

But, here's the thing... advice can also be kinda... ... limiting. Like, if you're trying to decide what to wear to a party, your mom might tell you to wear a nice dress, but what if you wanna make a statement with a bold outfit? You might end up feeling like you can't express yourself if you listen to all the advice you get. 

And, sometimes, advice can be... ... wrong. Like, if you're trying to decide which class to take in school, your friend might tell you to take the easy one, but if you're not challenging yourself, you might not learn as much. Or, if you're trying to decide whether to try out for the soccer team, your coach might tell you to go for it, but if you're not really interested in soccer, you might end up hating it. 

But, here's the thing... advice can also be super helpful in school! Like, if you're struggling with a math problem, your teacher can give you advice on how to approach it. Or, if you're trying to decide which book to read for class, your friend can give you advice on which one's gonna be the most interesting. 

So, in conclusion, advice is like... ... it's like a double-edged sword. It can help you make better decisions, but it can also limit you if you're not careful. It's important to listen to advice, but also to think for yourself and make your own choices.  And,",1,llama2_chat,4
"As an eighth-grade student, it is crucial to understand the importance of seeking multiple opinions from different people. In today's world, where diversity and inclusion are becoming increasingly important, it is essential to hear different perspectives to make informed decisions. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits of seeking multiple opinions from different people, using examples to illustrate each benefit.

Firstly, seeking multiple opinions can help to broaden one's understanding of a particular topic. When we only hear one perspective, we are limited to that person's perspective, which may not be representative of the entire population. For example, if a group of friends are discussing a new restaurant to try, each person may have different preferences based on their taste, dietary restrictions, and budget. By seeking opinions from different people, the group can gain a better understanding of the restaurant's menu and make a more informed decision.

Secondly, seeking multiple opinions can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. When we only hear one perspective, we may become stuck in our own way of thinking and miss out on other possibilities. For example, when a group of colleagues are brainstorming ideas for a new project, each person may have unique insights and suggestions that can lead to a more creative and innovative solution.

Thirdly, seeking multiple opinions can help to build stronger relationships and foster understanding between different groups of people. When we seek out and listen to different perspectives, we show that we value and respect the opinions of others. For example, when a group of students from different cultural backgrounds are working on a group project, seeking out and listening to each other's perspectives can help to build stronger relationships and foster understanding between different cultures.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions from different people has many benefits. By broadening our understanding of a particular topic, coming up with more creative and innovative solutions to problems, and building stronger relationships, we can make more informed decisions and foster understanding between different groups of people. As an eighth-grade student, it is essential to seek out and listen to different perspectives to become a more well-rounded and informed individual.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, “Determine never to be idle… It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.” The main point of this quotation is that when we stay active and keep doing something, we can get things done. Staying active means staying focused on the goals we want to achieve. Making a plan to accomplish our goals and having the dedication to complete it can bring amazing results. 

On the other hand, when we are inactive and not accomplishing tasks, it can be detrimental to progress. If we are idle for too long and do not put effort into our goals, they may remain stagnant and we might miss out on opportunities. In addition, too much inactivity can lead to laziness, apathy and depression. 

Therefore, it’s important to evaluate both the pros and cons of always doing something and not doing something to accomplish goals. Doing something shows dedication and passion for our goals while doing nothing might make us miss out on important progress. When considering this quote, it’s important to strike a balance when pursuing our goals. By doing too much, we can exhaust ourselves and affect our mental and physical health. But when doing too little, it could affect our progress just the same. 

Overall, the quote “Determine never to be idle… It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing” by Thomas Jefferson is an inspiring reminder to stay active and move forward with our goals. It’s essential to be both active and restful in order to have balance and obtain our goals in life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that teenagers should participate in extracurricular activities. Not only do extracurricular activities provide numerous benefits for personal growth and development, but they also help teenagers build important skills that will serve them well in the future.

First and foremost, participating in an extracurricular activity allows teenagers to explore their interests and passions. Whether it's playing a sport, joining a club, or volunteering, teenagers can find activities that they truly enjoy and are committed to. This not only helps them to develop a sense of purpose and fulfillment, but it also allows them to pursue their interests outside of the classroom.

In addition to allowing teenagers to explore their interests, extracurricular activities also provide opportunities for personal growth and development. For example, playing a sport requires discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. Joining a club or volunteer organization allows teenagers to develop leadership skills, communication skills, and a sense of community. These skills are not only important for success in school and work, but they are also essential for building strong relationships and making a positive impact in the world.

Furthermore, participating in an extracurricular activity can also improve a teenager's academic performance. Research has shown that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have higher grades and test scores than those who do not. This is because extracurricular activities often require time management, organization, and dedication, which are all important skills for academic success.

Personally, I have seen the benefits of extracurricular activities firsthand. When I was in high school, I joined the debate team and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Not only did I learn valuable communication and critical thinking skills, but I also made lifelong friends and gained a sense of confidence and self-assurance.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that teenagers should participate in extracurricular activities. Not only do they provide opportunities for personal growth and development, but they also help teenagers build important skills that will serve them well in the future. Whether it's playing a sport, joining a club, or volunteering, there is an extracurricular activity out there for everyone.

"Cell phones have become an integral part of our lives, and their use in the classroom has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that cell phones can be a valuable tool for education, others argue that they can be a distraction and negatively affect grades. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.

One of the main advantages of using cell phones in the classroom is the opportunity to enhance student engagement. Cell phones are equipped with a wide range of features, such as multimedia capabilities, internet connectivity, and interactive applications, which can be used to enhance the learning experience. For example, teachers can use cell phones to create interactive lessons, provide instant feedback, and engage students in collaborative activities.

Another advantage of using cell phones in the classroom is the ability to provide students with instant access to information. With the internet at their fingertips, students can quickly research topics, access educational resources, and collaborate with their peers. This can help students to develop critical thinking skills, research skills, and collaboration skills, which are essential for success in today's world.

However, there are also several disadvantages to using cell phones in the classroom. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for distraction. Cell phones are equipped with a wide range of features, such as social media, games, and messaging apps, which can be a distraction to students. If students are not using their cell phones for educational purposes, they may be more likely to miss important information, lose focus, and not achieve their full potential.

Another disadvantage of using cell phones in the classroom is the potential for cheating. With the internet at their fingertips, students may be tempted to cheat on exams or assignments. This can undermine the integrity of the educational system and make it difficult for teachers to assess student knowledge and skills accurately.

In conclusion, the use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has both advantages and disadvantages. While cell phones can enhance student engagement and provide instant access to information, they can also be a distraction and lead to cheating. It is important for teachers to use cell phones in a responsible and ethical manner, and for students to use them for educational purposes only. By doing so, we can ensure that students receive the best possible education and are prepared for",1,llammistral7binstruct,0

"Having a positive attitude is a crucial element in achieving success in life. It is not just about being optimistic or hopeful; it is about having the right mindset that can help us overcome challenges and seize opportunities. In this essay, I will explain why having a positive attitude is the key to success in life and provide examples of how it can help in real-life situations.

Firstly, having a positive attitude can help us in achieving our goals. When we have a positive mindset, we are more motivated to work towards our goals. We believe that we can achieve them and are willing to put in the effort required to make them a reality. For instance, when we are applying for a job, we feel confident that we are the right candidate for the position. This confidence helps us to put in a great effort during the interview process, which can increase our chances of getting hired. Similarly, when we are studying for an exam, we believe that we can pass it, which helps us to focus and prepare better.

Secondly, having a positive attitude can help us in dealing with stress and anxiety. Life is full of ups and downs, and we can't control everything that happens to us. However, we can control our response to these situations. When we have a positive attitude, we try to find the good in every situation, even if it seems bleak. For example, if we lose our job, we try to find new opportunities instead of dwelling on the negative. This positive mindset can help us to reduce stress and anxiety, which can have a significant impact on our mental and physical health.

Thirdly, having a positive attitude can help us in building strong relationships. When we have a positive attitude, we are more approachable and easier to talk to. People are drawn to positive people, and this can help us to build strong relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues. For instance, when we are at a party, we try to make conversation with people and make them feel comfortable. This positive attitude can help us to build strong connections with people, which can be beneficial in both personal and professional life.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. It can help us to achieve our goals, deal with stress and anxiety, and build strong relationships. We need to remember that life is not always easy, and we can't control everything that happens",1,llammistral7binstruct,1

Like, imagine having more time to do homework, seek help, and just chill after school!  It's like, totally possible, you know? 

First off, let's talk about how a four-day school week can save money on gas for both students and teachers.  Like, think about it. If we go to school four days a week instead of five, we'll be using less gas to get to and from school.  And that's not even counting the money we'll save on lunches and snacks!

But that's not all! A four-day school week can also give us more time to do homework.  I mean, let's be real, we all know that homework can be a total drag sometimes.  But with more time, we can take our time and actually understand the material instead of just rushing through it.  And that's not even mentioning the fact that we'll have more time to relax and do things we enjoy after school! 

And lastly, a four-day school week can give us more time to seek help if we need it.  Like, think about it. If we have an extra day off, we can use that time to get extra help from teachers or tutors if we're struggling in a certain subject.  It's like, a total game-changer!

First of all, let's face it, cell phones are a huge part of our lives nowadays. Like, literally everyone has one, and we use them for everything – social media, gaming, messaging, you name it. So, it's only natural that we'd want to use them in class too, right? 

But, some people might say, ""But, distractions! Students will get distracted and start scrolling through TikTok instead of paying attention to the lesson!"" And yeah, that's a valid point.

So, if they're allowed to use their phones, why can't we? 

Another thing is, cell phones can actually be really useful in class. Like, if we're learning about a new concept, we can look it up on our phones and get a better understanding of it. Or, if we're in a group project, we can use our phones to communicate with each other and share ideas.  It's like, the ultimate collaboration tool!

"Okay, here's my essay:

Summer assignments are a crucial part of the school year, and they can be designed in two different ways: by students or by teachers. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and in this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of each.

Student-designed projects give students more creative freedom and allow them to choose topics that interest them. For example, if a student is passionate about photography, they can create a project that showcases their best photos. This approach also encourages students to take ownership of their learning and develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects provide a structured framework for students to learn specific skills and concepts. For instance, a teacher might assign a project on a particular historical event or scientific concept, and students would have to research and present their findings in a specific format.

However, there are also some disadvantages to student-designed projects. For example, if students are left to choose their own topics, they might not choose something that is challenging or meaningful. Additionally, without a clear structure or guidelines, students might struggle to organize their work and meet deadlines. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects can be more predictable and less exciting for students, which can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement.

In conclusion, both student-designed and teacher-designed projects have their advantages and disadvantages. While student-designed projects offer more creativity and ownership, teacher-designed projects provide a structured framework for learning. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the individual student and their learning style, as well as the goals of the summer assignment.",1,llama2_chat,0
"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that students should not be allowed to use cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom. While some may argue that cell phones can be used as a tool for learning, I believe that the potential distractions and negative impacts on academic performance outweigh any potential benefits.

Firstly, cell phones are a major distraction in the classroom. Studies have shown that even the mere presence of a cell phone can decrease cognitive performance and memory retention. In a study conducted by the University of California, Irvine, students who were allowed to use cell phones in class performed 20% worse on tests than those who were not allowed to use them. This is because cell phones are designed to be constantly stimulating, with notifications, social media, and games all vying for attention. When students are allowed to use cell phones in class, it is almost impossible for them to focus solely on the lesson at hand.

Secondly, cell phones can be a major source of cheating in the classroom. With the internet at their fingertips, students can easily access answers and cheat on tests and assignments. In fact, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 35% of teenagers have cheated on a test or assignment at least once. This is a serious problem, as cheating not only undermines the integrity of the educational system, but also teaches students that it is acceptable to cut corners and take the easy way out.

Finally, cell phones can be a major source of distraction outside of the classroom as well. Students who are constantly glued to their phones are missing out on important social interactions and experiences. They are also not developing the necessary skills to communicate effectively in person. In a world where face-to-face communication is becoming increasingly rare, it is important that students are given the opportunity to develop these skills.

In conclusion, while cell phones may have some potential benefits for education, the potential distractions and negative impacts on academic performance and social development make it clear that students should not be allowed to use them for educational purposes in the classroom. By banning cell phones in the classroom, we can create a more focused and productive learning environment, and help students develop the skills they need to succeed in the future.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Throughout history, there have been endless examples of people who have turned failure into success. Wilma Rudolph, a Paralympic athlete, is a powerful example of how failure can be turned into success. Despite contracting polio when she was a toddler, she overcame it and went on to become the first American black woman to win three gold medals in the 1960 Rome Olympics. Her example shows that success comes with hard work, perseverance, and optimism, even in the face of adversity. 

In contrast, failure can be discouraging or even detrimental to some. Sometimes, facing failure with a negative attitude can derail success and make it harder to get motivated. This could be because those with a negative attitude, view failure as absolute, rather than something to learn from and build upon. 

On the other hand, some people have the opinion that failure should be embraced and seen as a learning opportunity. entrepreneur Jim Rohn famously said, “Your challenge is not to avoid mistakes, but to recognize that failure is a path to personal growth.” This emphasizes that failure should be taken as a way to grow and develop valuable skills. 

Chris Gardner is a fine example of how coming back from failure is very much possible. Despite being homeless with his son, he never gave up on his entrepreneurial dreams and went on to found his own stockbrokerage firm. He teaches us that success means never taking “no” for an answer, and that everyone can start again if they choose to. 

The resilience some have when faced with failure can often come from their willingness to take risks and stay optimistic about the future. Having a growth mindset helps to keep failure from spiraling into a deeper pit of confusion and regret. Focusing on the positive and staying motivated in the face of adversity will empower people to brush off failures more quickly and continue on towards success. 

In conclusion, failure is just as important as success in many aspects of life. Not only does it give people the opportunity to learn and grow, but it can also shape their personality and give them the confidence to take measured risks. People should stay motivated and optimistic when faced with failure and use it as a stepping stone towards success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research the benefits of partnerships between schools and companies, and how they can impact individual students. I think it's pretty cool how schools and companies can work together to provide opportunities for students. Like, imagine being able to get work experience while still in school? It's like, the best of both worlds!

So, one of the biggest benefits of school-company partnerships is that they can provide students with job shadowing and internship opportunities. This can help students get a feel for what it's like to work in a particular field, and can even give them a head start on their careers. Plus, it looks great on college applications! I mean, who doesn't want to see that they have work experience? It shows that you're serious about your future and willing to put in the effort.

Another benefit is that partnerships can provide students with access to resources and opportunities that they might not have otherwise had. Like, maybe a company can offer a scholarship or a special program for students who are interested in their field. It's like, a win-win situation! Students get the opportunity to learn and grow, and the company gets to attract talented young people who are excited about their industry.

But, there are also some potential downsides to school-company partnerships. One of the biggest concerns is that students might feel pressure to choose a certain career path because of the partnership. Like, if a company is offering a lot of opportunities, but it's not something that the student is really interested in, they might feel like they have to go for it anyway. That can be really stressful and can lead to burnout.

Another thing to consider is the impact of working while in school on students' mental and financial stability. It's great that students can earn money while they're still in school, but it can also be really tough to balance work and school. Students might find themselves staying up late to finish assignments, or skipping out on social events to work. That can be really hard, and it can affect their mental health. Plus, if they're not careful, they might end up in debt from taking on too much work.

So, to pursue their desired courses of study and life goals, students",1,llama2_chat,1

"My grandfather has had a significant impact on my love for soccer. Growing up, I would always watch him play with his friends in the park. He was an excellent player, and his passion for the game was contagious. He would always encourage me to play and taught me the basics of the game. I remember him telling me to always keep my head up and to never give up, even when things got tough.

As I grew older, I started to play soccer myself. My grandfather would always come to my games and cheer me on. He was my biggest fan, and his support meant the world to me. He would always give me advice on how to improve my game and would encourage me to keep playing.

One of the reasons I would like to visit Florida is to see my grandfather. He lives there, and I haven't seen him in a while. I would love to spend some time with him and catch up on everything.

"Graduating high school in three years is becoming an increasingly popular option among young students. While some may argue that four years is necessary to fully prepare for college, there are several benefits to graduating early. In this essay, I will present the advantages of graduating high school in three years, including examples of successful people who have done this, the extra opportunities that open up, and the special advantages for young students.

One of the main benefits of graduating high school in three years is the opportunity to enter college or university early. Many colleges and universities offer early admission programs for students who graduate early from high school. This means that students can start their higher education journey a year earlier, potentially saving them time and money in the long run. For example, a student who graduates high school in three years could potentially start college in the fall of their senior year, rather than the following year.

Another benefit of graduating high school in three years is the opportunity to pursue further education or career opportunities. Many students who graduate early are able to take advantage of this extra time to pursue internships, apprenticeships, or other experiential learning opportunities. This can help them gain valuable skills and experience that will be beneficial when they enter the workforce. Additionally, some students may choose to use their extra time to pursue a specialized area of interest, such as a language or a particular subject.

There are also several successful people who have graduated high school in three years. For example, Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, graduated from Lakeside School in Seattle when he was just 17 years old. Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy when he was 16 years old. These examples demonstrate that graduating high school early does not necessarily hinder a student's ability to succeed later in life.

Finally, graduating high school in three years can be a special advantage for young students. It can provide a sense of accomplishment and boost their confidence, which can be beneficial in many aspects of life. Additionally, it can help students develop important skills such as time management, organization, and self-discipline, which will serve them well in the future.

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years has several benefits that can be beneficial for young students. These include the opportunity to enter college or university early,",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"When I think of failing but still achieving success, two personal experiences come to mind. First, while preparing for the SATs, I studied hard for over four months but still achieved only mediocre scores. Yet rather than giving up, I studied more compromises and eventually scored high enough to gain admission into the college I wanted to attend. Secondly, my attempt to learn guitar was hampered by my lack of talent, and I kept failing every time I tried. But, I kept at it and eventually taught myself well enough to make basic melodies and chords. 

Winston Churchill’s quote “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts” has had an impact on my views on failure – it has made me realize that failure is just a stepping stone to success, and that it should not be feared, but embraced. Rather than being a deterrent to success, failure should be embraced as an opportunity to learn and grow.

I also recall one instance when a friend of mine quit soon after attempting something difficult. Even though I had tried to convince him that perseverance was the only way forward, he seemed to have given up. Seeing him give up so easily made me realize how important it is to be willing to take risks and keep failing until we eventually find success.

I believe the most successful people are the ones who maintain enthusiasm for success even after failure. They face failure, evaluate their mistakes and keep on striving for greater heights with a positive attitude and unceasing determination. People with this drive to never give up no matter how bleak the situation may be truly understand that failure is not an end, but a path to a greater success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Enthusiasm is a crucial component of overcoming failure. It is the driving force that propels individuals to keep going even when faced with adversity. Without enthusiasm, it becomes difficult to maintain motivation and persist in the face of obstacles. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of enthusiasm in overcoming failure and provide an example to illustrate my point.

Firstly, enthusiasm provides individuals with the energy and drive to continue working towards their goals. When faced with failure, it is easy to become discouraged and give up. However, enthusiasm allows individuals to maintain a positive attitude and keep pushing forward. This is evident in the story of Thomas Edison, who famously failed thousands of times before finally inventing the light bulb. Despite the numerous failures, Edison remained enthusiastic about his work and continued to experiment until he finally succeeded.

Secondly, enthusiasm helps individuals to view failure as a learning opportunity rather than a setback. When individuals are enthusiastic about their work, they are more likely to see failure as a chance to learn and improve. This mindset allows individuals to continue working towards their goals without becoming discouraged. For example, when I took a science class in middle school, I failed my first test. However, instead of becoming discouraged, I used the opportunity to review the material and improve my understanding. With enthusiasm and a positive attitude, I was able to achieve an A on my next test.

Finally, enthusiasm provides individuals with the resilience to bounce back from failure. When individuals are enthusiastic about their work, they are more likely to persist in the face of adversity. This resilience allows individuals to overcome setbacks and continue working towards their goals. For example, when I started my own business, I faced numerous challenges and setbacks. However, I remained enthusiastic about my work and continued to persevere. With hard work and determination, my business was able to overcome these challenges and achieve success.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is a crucial component of overcoming failure. It provides individuals with the energy, drive, and resilience needed to continue working towards their goals. By maintaining a positive attitude and viewing failure as a learning opportunity, individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve success. As the famous saying goes, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" With",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"The Importance of Education in Improving Economic and Social Outcomes

Education is a crucial factor in determining an individual's economic and social outcomes. It is a tool that can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the workforce and contribute to society. Education can also play a significant role in promoting economic development and reducing poverty. In this essay, we will explore the different ways that individuals can access higher education, the potential impacts of different techniques, and examples of successful educational efforts that have been implemented to promote economic development and reduce poverty.

There are many ways that individuals can access higher education, including traditional colleges and universities, community colleges, trade schools, and online programs. Each of these options has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice will depend on the individual's goals and circumstances. For example, community colleges are often more affordable and accessible than traditional colleges and universities, but they may not offer the same level of education. Trade schools, on the other hand, can provide individuals with specialized skills and knowledge that may be in high demand in the workforce.

Regardless of the type of higher education program, there are potential impacts that can be achieved. For example, individuals with higher levels of education tend to have higher earning potential and better job opportunities. They also tend to be more politically engaged and have a greater impact on their communities. Additionally, education can play a significant role in promoting economic development by increasing innovation, productivity, and entrepreneurship.

There are many examples of successful educational efforts that have been implemented to promote economic development and reduce poverty. One such example is the 100% College program in the United States, which aims to ensure that all students have the opportunity to attend college. This program has been successful in increasing the number of students who attend college and has had a positive impact on the economy.

Another example is the World Bank's Education for All initiative, which aims to ensure that all children have access to quality education. This initiative has been successful in increasing the number of students enrolled in primary and secondary school and has had a positive impact on poverty rates.

Raising the financial resources to attend college can be a significant challenge for many students. There are several ways that students can raise the funds they need, including scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study programs. Additionally, policies can be implemented to make higher education",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, I know it's totally cliché, but I gotta agree with Winston Churchill on this one. Mistakes and failure, like, totally are essential to success!  I mean, think about it. If we never made mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything! 

Like, have you ever blundered into something and it totally didn't go your way?  Like, I once tried to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but I accidentally grabbed the wrong jar and it was like, super sour!  It was a total disaster, but I learned how to label things better! 

And don't even get me started on how failure can prime us for success!  Like, if we never failed, we wouldn't know how to handle it when it happens again!  It's like, unavoidable, you know?  But it's okay to fail, because it makes us stronger and more resilient!

"Being successful in life is something that many people strive for, but it can be challenging to achieve while still staying true to oneself. In my opinion, being successful in life is not just about achieving material possessions or career advancement, but also about finding fulfillment and happiness.

One way to be successful in life while staying true to oneself is to set realistic goals and work towards them consistently. It is important to set goals that align with your values and passions, rather than just focusing on what others expect of you. By setting achievable goals, you can focus on making progress and feeling a sense of accomplishment, without sacrificing your authenticity.

Another way to be successful in life while staying true to oneself is to surround yourself with positive and supportive people. It is important to have a network of friends and family who encourage and support you in your journey. By surrounding yourself with positive influences, you can stay motivated and focused on your goals, while still maintaining your unique personality and values.

It is also important to remember that success is not just about what you achieve, but also about how you achieve it. By staying true to yourself and following your own path, you can find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in your life. This can lead to greater success in the long run, as you will be more motivated and focused on achieving your goals.

In conclusion, being successful in life while staying true to oneself is possible with careful planning, a supportive network, and a focus on personal fulfillment.

"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that students have the right to work and demonstrate their abilities in order to gain experience and become independent. While education is important, it is not the only path to success. In fact, many students find that working during their teenage years can provide valuable skills and experiences that they may not have gained otherwise.

When deciding what career to pursue, students should consider a variety of factors. First and foremost, they should think about their interests and passions. It is important to choose a career that aligns with your interests and that you are passionate about. This will help you stay motivated and engaged in your work, which is essential for success.

In addition to considering your interests, students should also think about their strengths and skills. What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing? These are important questions to ask yourself when deciding on a career path. By identifying your strengths and skills, you can choose a career that allows you to utilize them to their fullest potential.

Another consideration when choosing a career is the job market. What are the job prospects for the career you are interested in? Are there opportunities for growth and advancement? These are important questions to ask yourself when considering a career path.

Education and parents can have a significant impact on a student's journey towards independence. Education provides students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their chosen career. It also helps students develop important life skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.

Parents can also play a role in a student's journey towards independence. They can provide support and guidance as their child navigates the job market and makes important decisions about their future. They can also help their child develop important life skills such as responsibility, time management, and budgeting.

In conclusion, I believe that students have the right to work and demonstrate their abilities in order to gain experience and become independent. When deciding what career to pursue, students should consider their interests, strengths, and the job market. Education and parents can also have a significant impact on a student's journey towards independence. By taking these factors into account, students can make informed decisions about their future and set themselves up for success.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"The statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a quote attributed to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. This quote suggests that success is not about avoiding failure, but rather about persevering through it. In this essay, I will explore whether this statement is true and consider both reasons for believing it is true and counterarguments that it is not necessary to fail to learn and succeed.

On the one hand, there are several reasons to believe that Churchill's statement is true. Firstly, learning from mistakes is essential for growth and development. When we fail, we gain valuable insights into what went wrong and what we can do differently next time. This allows us to improve and become better at what we do. Secondly, perseverance is crucial for success. It takes time and effort to achieve our goals, and we often encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way. Without the ability to push through these challenges, we may give up and never achieve our objectives. Finally, enthusiasm is a key factor in achieving success. When we are enthusiastic about what we are doing, we are more likely to put in the effort and persevere through difficulties.

On the other hand, there are also counterarguments to Churchill's statement. For example, some people argue that it is not necessary to fail in order to succeed. They believe that success can be achieved through hard work, dedication, and determination, without the need for failure. Additionally, some people argue that failure can be demotivating and lead to a loss of enthusiasm, rather than the opposite.

In conclusion, while Churchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a powerful one, it is not without its flaws. There are valid counterarguments to this statement, and it is important to consider both sides of the argument when evaluating its truthfulness. Ultimately, success is a complex and multifaceted concept, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving it.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else can help you see wonderful things. In today's world, it is easy to get caught up in the pressures of society and to try to fit in with the crowd. However, I believe that by embracing our individuality and being true to ourselves, we can open ourselves up to a world of possibilities and experiences that we may not have otherwise had the opportunity to see.

One example of this is visiting a place to see nature. When we go into a big forest or see big hills, we are able to connect with the natural world in a way that is not possible when we are surrounded by buildings and concrete. We can see the beauty of the trees, the colors of the flowers, and the sounds of the birds. This connection to nature can help us understand the changing life around us, as we see how the seasons change and how the world is constantly evolving.

Another example of the benefits of being true to ourselves is going to see a place to see nature. When we go to a place to see nature, we are able to connect with the natural world in a way that is not possible when we are surrounded by buildings and concrete. We can see the beauty of the trees, the colors of the flowers, and the sounds of the birds. This connection to nature can help us understand the changing life around us, as we see how the seasons change and how the world is constantly evolving.

I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because I believe that being true to ourselves is the key to living a fulfilling and meaningful life. When we try to fit in with the crowd and conform to the expectations of others, we are not able to fully express ourselves and live our lives to the fullest. By embracing our individuality and being true to ourselves, we are able to see the world in a new light and open ourselves up to experiences and opportunities that we may not have had the chance to have otherwise.

In conclusion, being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else can help you see wonderful things. By embracing our individuality and being true to ourselves, we are able to connect with the natural world, understand the changing life around us, and live a fulfilling and meaningful life.

"English as a Second Language (ESL) programs have become increasingly popular in schools around the world as more and more students are learning English as their second language. These programs are designed to help students who are not native English speakers to improve their language skills and become more proficient in English.

One of the main benefits of ESL programs is that they provide students with the opportunity to practice their English skills in a structured and supportive environment. These programs typically include a variety of activities and exercises that are designed to improve vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and other language skills. Students are often paired with native English speakers who act as language partners, allowing them to practice their conversational skills and gain confidence in their ability to speak English.

ESL programs also provide students with the opportunity to learn about the culture and customs of the country where they are studying. This can be especially helpful for students who are planning to study or work in an English-speaking country in the future. By learning about the culture and customs of the country, students can better understand and appreciate the language and its role in the community.

In addition to the benefits for the students, ESL programs can also have a positive impact on the school community as a whole. By providing students with the opportunity to learn English, schools can help to foster a more diverse and inclusive community. This can be especially important in today's globalized world, where it is increasingly important for students to be able to communicate with people from different backgrounds and cultures.

Overall, ESL programs are an important tool for schools to help students improve their English skills and become more proficient in the language. These programs provide students with the opportunity to practice their skills in a structured and supportive environment, learn about the culture and customs of the country where they are studying, and foster a more diverse and inclusive school community.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Hey, Mrs. Smith! Here's my essay on whether first impressions are difficult to change. 😊

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new and they think you're cool or not. But, is it hard to change those impressions once they're made? Like, can you really turn someone's first impression of you around? I think so, but also not really. Here's why:

So, like, sometimes when you meet someone new, they might think you're really cool or funny or whatever, but then they get to know you better and they realize you're actually kind of lame or boring. That's when their first impression starts to change. But, it's not always easy to change those impressions. Like, if someone thinks you're a total weirdo at first, it might be hard to convince them that you're actually cool once they get to know you better.

On the other hand, sometimes you can totally change someone's first impression of you. Like, if you're really friendly and outgoing at first, and then you start acting all weird and shy, they might think you're even cooler because you're not just some boring person all the time. Or, like, if you do something really cool or brave, it can totally change their first impression of you. Like, if you save someone from a burning building or something, they're gonna think you're a total hero and want to be your friend forever! 😅

So, yeah, first impressions are important, but they're not always set in stone. You can totally change them if you want to, but it might take some effort and time. And, like, sometimes it's better to just let things be and not try to change someone's first impression of you. Like, if they think you're a total nerd, maybe you should just embrace it and show them how cool being a nerd can be! 🤓

Anyway, that's my essay on first impressions. I hope you like it, Mrs. Smith! 😊 Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can",1,llama2_chat,3
"Technology has had a profound impact on society, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, technology has made communication, information sharing, and problem-solving easier and more efficient. For example, with the advent of the internet, people can now communicate with others across the globe in real-time, access vast amounts of information, and collaborate on projects without being physically present. This has led to increased productivity and innovation, as well as the ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures.

On the other hand, technology has also been linked to negative effects such as social isolation, decreased attention span, and aggressive behavior. For instance, the constant use of social media has been shown to lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, as people substitute online connections for face-to-face interactions. Additionally, the constant stream of information and notifications can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety.

In comparison to the past, technology has become even more integral to our daily lives. With the rise of smartphones and other mobile devices, people are now constantly connected to the internet and can access information and tools on the go. This has led to increased productivity and efficiency, as well as the ability to stay connected with loved ones no matter where they are in the world. However, this increased reliance on technology has also led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions, which can have negative consequences for mental health and social skills.

To address these issues, it is important to find a balance between technology use and face-to-face interaction. This can involve setting limits on technology use, such as turning off devices during meals or social events, and making an effort to engage in face-to-face interactions on a regular basis. Additionally, educating children and adults about the potential negative effects of technology use can help them to use it in a more responsible and healthy way.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on society, both positive and negative. While it has made communication and problem-solving easier, it has also been linked to negative effects such as social isolation and decreased attention span. By finding a balance between technology use and face-to-face interaction, we can ensure that technology is used in a way that promotes mental and social well-being.",1,llama2_chat,0
"It is a well-known fact that people have different personalities. Some people are outgoing and extroverted, while others are introverted and reserved. These differences in personality can have a significant impact on how people interact with each other.

One reason why people can have a bad day is due to their personality traits. For example, an introverted person may feel overwhelmed by social situations and may struggle to connect with others. On the other hand, an extroverted person may become easily frustrated or agitated in high-pressure situations.

However, it is important to note that people can also have bad days due to external factors such as stress, anxiety, or a difficult situation. These factors can affect anyone, regardless of their personality traits.

Despite this, people can change their first impressions of others. This is because first impressions are often based on superficial factors such as appearance or behavior. By getting to know someone on a deeper level, we can form a more accurate understanding of their personality and character.

It is also important to remember that people can change their own behavior and attitudes. For example, an introverted person may work on developing their social skills in order to feel more comfortable in social situations. Similarly, an extroverted person may work on managing their stress and anxiety in order to handle high-pressure situations more effectively.

In conclusion, people have different personalities, and these differences can have a significant impact on how people interact with each other. However, people can also have bad days due to external factors, and these days can affect anyone. Despite this, people can change their first impressions of others by getting to know them on a deeper level, and they can also change their own behavior and attitudes in order to better handle difficult situations.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that praising students for building self-esteem is of utmost importance. Self-esteem refers to a person's belief in their own abilities and worth, and it plays a crucial role in a person's overall well-being. When students are praised for their efforts and accomplishments, they are more likely to believe in themselves and their abilities, which can lead to increased confidence and motivation.

Praising students for building self-esteem can have a positive impact on their academic performance as well. When students feel confident in their abilities, they are more likely to take on new challenges and push themselves to achieve their goals. This can lead to higher grades and a greater sense of accomplishment. Additionally, students with high self-esteem are more likely to be resilient in the face of failure and setbacks, as they believe in their ability to overcome obstacles and learn from their mistakes.

Praising students for building self-esteem can also have a positive impact on their mental health. Research has shown that low self-esteem is linked to a range of negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and even suicide. By praising students for their efforts and accomplishments, we can help to build their self-esteem and reduce the risk of these negative outcomes.

Furthermore, praising students for building self-esteem can also have a positive impact on their relationships with others. When students feel confident in themselves, they are more likely to be assertive and communicate effectively, which can lead to better relationships with peers and adults. Additionally, students with high self-esteem are more likely to be empathetic and understanding of others, which can lead to stronger relationships.

In conclusion, praising students for building self-esteem is of utmost importance. When students feel confident in themselves, they are more likely to achieve their goals, maintain their mental health, and build strong relationships with others. As educators and parents, it is our responsibility to provide a supportive and positive environment that fosters the development of self-esteem in our students. By doing so, we can help to create a generation of confident, motivated, and well-rounded individuals who are ready to take on the challenges of the world.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Hey there! 

So, you know how people always say ""never give up"" and stuff? Like, it's this super cliché thing that our teachers and parents keep telling us, but it's actually really important. Like, think about it. If Thomas Jefferson hadn't given up on his dream of becoming president, we wouldn't have the Declaration of Independence! 

Okay, so, Thomas Jefferson was this dude who lived a long time ago. Like, in the 1700s. And he was all about freedom and stuff, which is cool. But, he didn't start out as this super important person. He was just some lawyer guy who wrote letters and stuff. But, he didn't give up on his dream of becoming president. Even when people were all like ""you'll never be president, dude, you're not even born in the right country!"" He was all like ""watch me!"" And he worked really hard and stuff, and eventually, he became president! 

Now, I know it's not always easy to keep going when things get tough. Like, I'm totally struggling with this math project right now. It's like, so hard and I don't understand anything!  But, if Thomas Jefferson can do it, then I can too!  And, like, think about all the other people who have achieved their dreams. They didn't give up either! 

So, my point is, never giving up is super important. It helps you achieve your dreams and stuff, and it shows that you're persistent and determined. And, like, who doesn't want to be persistent and determined?  It's like, the coolest thing ever! 

Okay, so, in conclusion, never giving up is totally important. It can help you achieve your dreams and stuff, and it shows that you're persistent and determined. So, don't give up on your dreams, no matter how hard things get!  Keep going, and you'll get there!

"Title: The Importance of Failure in the Pursuit of Success

Introduction:

Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" This famous phrase highlights the significance of failure in the journey towards success. As an 8th grader, I believe that failure is an essential element to consider in the pursuit of success. In this essay, I will explain why failure is important, provide examples of how it can lead to success or create problems, outline the steps to take when facing failure, and summarize why failure is an integral part of the success process.

Why Failure is Important:

Failure is often seen as a negative experience that hinders progress and achievement. However, I believe that failure is a crucial stepping stone towards success. When we fail, we learn valuable lessons that help us improve and grow. For instance, if we fail a test, we can review the material and study harder for the next test, leading to better results. Similarly, if we start a business and it fails, we can use that experience to create a better business idea. Failure teaches us to be resilient, adaptable, and persistent, which are essential qualities for success.

Examples of How Failure Can Lead to Success:

1. Thomas Edison failed over 1,000 times before inventing the light bulb. His persistence and determination led to a groundbreaking invention.
2. J.K. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish the Harry Potter series. Her determination and failure led to a global phenomenon.
3. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team. He used this failure as motivation to improve his skills and became one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

Steps to Take When Facing Failure:

1. Don't give up: The first step to overcoming failure is to not give up. Keep pushing forward and trying new things.
2. Learn from your mistakes: Analyze what went wrong and learn from your mistakes. Use this knowledge to improve and grow.
3. Seek help: Don't be afraid to ask for help from friends, family, or ment",1,llama2_chat,4
"First impressions often form the basis for how a person is perceived and treated. However, over time, these first impressions can change when a person is presented with friendly relationships and support networks. When people are given the support they need to grow and develop, it can open up doors and help them to challenge their initial second-guessing of themselves. Through the right friendships and relationships, both parties come to know each other, understand each other’s good and bad habits, and support each other in times of difficulty. It is also easier for people to improve their weaknesses and showcase their positive attributes when their relationships offer them a safe space to do so. Through these relationships, a person’s impression of themselves will improve, as will the impressions of those around them.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Kindness is a virtue that is highly valued in society. It is often said that a little kindness goes a long way, and this is true in many ways. While showing kindness can have positive effects on others, it can also have negative effects on the person showing kindness.

One of the most positive effects of showing kindness is the feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes with it. When we help others, we feel good about ourselves and our actions. This feeling of satisfaction can lead to increased self-esteem and a sense of purpose. For example, when a person volunteers at a homeless shelter, they may feel a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes with making a difference in someone else's life.

Another positive effect of kindness is the strengthening of relationships. When we show kindness to others, we create a bond with them that can last a lifetime. This bond can be strengthened through continued acts of kindness, such as offering to help a friend with a difficult task or lending a listening ear to someone who needs to talk. For example, when a person helps their friend move, they may create a bond that lasts for years to come.

However, kindness can also have negative effects on the person showing kindness. For example, when we show kindness to others, we may feel drained or overwhelmed. This can happen if we are constantly helping others without taking care of ourselves. Additionally, if we show kindness to others but do not receive it in return, we may feel resentful or hurt. For example, if a person always volunteers to help their friend with a difficult task but never receives any help from their friend, they may feel resentful or hurt.

In conclusion, kindness is a virtue that has both positive and negative effects. While showing kindness can create strong bonds and bring fulfillment, it can also drain and overwhelm the person showing kindness. It is important to find a balance between showing kindness to others and taking care of ourselves. By doing so, we can create a positive impact on ourselves and others.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Winston Churchill's quote, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts,"" is a powerful message that encourages us to keep pushing forward, even in the face of adversity. In my opinion, this quote is incredibly important because it reminds us that success and failure are both temporary, and that what truly matters is our ability to persevere through difficult times.

One example from my own life that supports this idea is my experience with sports. When I was younger, I played soccer and basketball competitively. I had some successes and some failures, but what I learned was that it was not the outcome of the game that mattered, but rather my ability to keep playing and never give up. Even when I was losing, I still had to keep going, and that was what ultimately made me a better athlete.

This quote also applies to other areas of life, such as academics and careers. It's easy to get discouraged when we don't achieve our goals or when we face setbacks, but what's important is that we don't let that defeat us. We need to keep pushing forward and continue to work towards our goals, even if we don't see immediate success.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's quote, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts,"" is a powerful message that encourages us to persevere through difficult times. Whether it's in sports, academics, or our careers, it's important to remember that success and failure are both temporary, and that what truly matters is our ability to keep going.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Hey there! 👋 As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write about the awesome benefits of field trips for middle schoolers like us! 🎉

So, did you know that being stuck in one place for too long can actually be bad for our mental and physical health? 🤯 Yeah, it's true! When we're constantly sitting in the same old classroom, it can lead to stress and fatigue. Ugh, who wants to feel like they're stuck in a rut? 😴 Not me, for sure!

But, when we take breaks and go on field trips, it's like a whole new world opens up! 🌎 We get to explore new places, learn new things, and hang out with our friends in a different environment. It's like a breath of fresh air! 🌲 And, it's not just about having fun (although, let's be real, who doesn't love having fun? 😜).

Research shows that field trips can have a serious impact on our mental and physical well-being. 🧠🏋️‍♀️ When we're in new surroundings, it can help us develop a greater appreciation for the world around us and even improve our problem-solving skills! 💡 Plus, it can help us make new friends and strengthen our relationships with our current friends. 🤝

Now, I know some people might think that field trips are a waste of time because we're not learning as much as we would be in school. 🤔 But, let me tell you, being in a new place can actually make learning more interesting and engaging! 🤓 When we're in a different environment, it can help us see things from a different perspective and make connections we might not have made otherwise. It's like, our brains are like sponges, soaking up all the new info and experiences! 🧡

So, in conclusion, field trips are like the best thing since sliced bread! 🍞 They help us de-stress, learn new things, make new friends,",1,llama2_chat,2
"Life is filled with moments of joy, as well as times of struggle. It is all too easy to become discouraged or overwhelmed in the face of setbacks and opposition. To sustain enthusiasm and resilience throughout our lives in order to achieve our goals, it is important to develop our own personal strategies for dealing with depression and disappointment.

One strategy is to focus on the positives in any situation. Make it a point to savor accomplishments and embrace the journey of learning and growth, even if it's during a difficult period. Another key approach is to foster a positive and resilient mindset. Change our internal dialogue from ""This is too hard"" to ""I can do this.""

Family and friends are also significant resources for staying motivated. Having an accountability partner, even just checking in every once in a while, can remind us of our goals and inspire us to make progress. We can also draw strength and motivation from the people around us. My grandmother, for example, kept going in her job well past retirement age because she was passionate about her work and enjoyed being surrounded by a positive and supportive community.

Though there are certain challenges that life throws our way, with the right frame of mind and the right support system, we can conquer almost anything. As long as we remember to stay optimistic, stay motivated, and always remember why we are striving, we will be able to achieve our goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"One way school administrators can attempt to create an environment conducive to learning is by regulating the use of phones during school lunch. On the one hand, having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch can create a more relaxed atmosphere and provide students with an opportunity to unwind and connect with friends and family outside of the classroom. Furthermore, allowing phones during lunch can make it easier for students to access educational resources, such as online dictionaries and fact-checking websites. On the other hand, having a policy that does not allow phones during school lunch can help create an environment that is less distracting for both students and staff. This can allow students to focus on their lunch and conversations with their peers, while providing a break from constant phone use. Additionally, not allowing phones during lunch can also reduce the risk of data misuse, as students become less exposed to social media and online services. Ultimately, each school will need to decide which policy is appropriate for its setting, in order to create a safe and supportive school environment.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"A positive attitude can have profoundly positive effects on a person's life. A positive attitude has been linked to increased resilience and improved performance in a variety of contexts, including work, education, relationships, and happiness. Adopting a positive attitude can lead to better opportunities, increased self-confidence, improved problem-solving, and a greater sense of well-being. For example, taking an optimistic outlook on a challenge can equip a person with the right mindset for achieving their goals. In contrast, having a negative attitude can lead to lower motivation, decreased confidence, and further difficulties in reaching desired outcomes. It can also create a negative spiral of self-defeating thoughts and behaviors, making it harder for a person to succeed. Maintaining a positive attitude is therefore essential in enabling a person to reach their ambitions and cultivate a happier life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Emerson once said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This statement highlights the importance of individuality and the benefits that come with it. In today's world, it is easy to get caught up in the crowd and to follow the trends without thinking for oneself. However, Emerson's statement reminds us that true individuality is essential for personal growth and fulfillment.

One example of the importance of individuality is seen in the world of art. Throughout history, artists have pushed boundaries and challenged the status quo in order to create works that truly reflect their individuality. For example, Vincent van Gogh's use of bold colors and swirling brushstrokes set him apart from other artists of his time, and his works continue to be celebrated for their unique beauty. Similarly, Pablo Picasso's groundbreaking Cubist style challenged traditional notions of beauty and paved the way for future generations of artists.

Another example of the importance of individuality is seen in the world of science. Throughout history, scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries by thinking outside the box and challenging conventional wisdom. For example, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity challenged the traditional understanding of space and time, and his work continues to be celebrated for its profound impact on our understanding of the universe. Similarly, Marie Curie's pioneering work on radioactivity led to the discovery of new elements and paved the way for future generations of scientists.

In my own life, I have seen the benefits of individuality firsthand. When I was younger, I was often afraid to speak my mind or to take risks. However, as I have grown older, I have learned that true success comes from embracing my individuality and pursuing my passions, even if it means going against the crowd. For example, when I was in high school, I was interested in starting my own business. Many of my peers told me that it was impossible, but I refused to give up on my dream. I did my research, created a business plan, and eventually successfully launched my own business. This experience taught me the importance of believing in myself and following my own path, even when others doubted me.

In conclusion, Emerson's statement about individuality is correct. Throughout history, we have seen the benefits of thinking outside the box and",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Extracurricular activities have been widely studied in relation to student educational outcomes and the opinions of parents. Research has shown that students who participate in organized extracurricular activities tend to demonstrate improved academic performance and greater interest in learning. At the same time, parents often become involved in their children's extracurricular activities, providing further support for academic achievement.

However, extracurricular activities can also have negative effects, particularly when students participate in too much activity. A lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and increased stress can all lead to burnout and decreased school performance. Over-scheduling students can also have detrimental effects on their physical and mental health. 

Finally, introducing incentive rules for extracurricular activities in a school system can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, incentives can help to increase participation in extracurricular activities and may help to further stimulate the academic performance of students. However, they can also encourage competition and competition-related stress in students, leading to lower self-esteem and decreased academic performance.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"For many students, the idea of having to attend a full day of school can be overwhelming. Half day school plans can be a great opportunity for students to focus on their studies and tend to other commitments that may occupy their time outside of school. Half day school plans also give teachers the chance to provide more tailored educational experiences, as the additional free time students get from the half day plan offers them more options to explore their interests and engage in activities that can supplement their learning.

One study conducted by the University of California, Davis, found that when students were given the chance to attend classes in a half day format, their test scores improved significantly. The students who were part of the study also reported that they experienced less academic stress, due to the shorter schedule. This suggests that the half day school plans can be beneficial not only for students' academic performance, but also in terms of their overall mental health.

Another benefit to half day school plans is that it can allow schools to offer more electives to students. By having fewer overall school hours during the day, schools can dedicate classroom time to giving students more access to different types of classes, such as art, music or tech. This gives students more chances to explore different topics and interests, which can be important for gaining new skills and further developing their intellect.

Overall, half day school plans can be beneficial for students by providing greater academic opportunities and by also offering more free time for students to study, explore different topics and focus on their mental health. By advocating for a half day school plan, we can ensure that our students get the best educational and personal experiences.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, I know some people might think it's weird that I'm writing about this, but I really think it's important.  See, I think that students at Principal's school should be able to participate in sports and activities even if their grades are below a D. 

First of all, let's talk about why grades are important.  Of course, grades are important, but they shouldn't be the only thing that matters.  I mean, grades are important for college and stuff, but they don't define who we are as people.  Like, I know some super smart people who are total slackers, and some not-so-smart people who are, like, total rockstars. 

And, like, sports and activities are super important too.  They help us learn teamwork, discipline, and, like, how to be good losers.  Yeah, I said it. Losing is hard, but it's important to learn how to handle it with grace and stuff.  Plus, it's just more fun to be involved in stuff outside of school.  Imagine if we had a basketball team!  We could totally win regionals! 

Okay, okay, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what about the other students who are working hard and getting good grades? Why should they have to compete with people who aren't even trying?""  And, like, I get that.  It's not fair to those students who are putting in the effort.  But, like, I think it's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles.  Maybe the student who's not doing so well in school is, like, super talented in sports or art or something.  And maybe they're just not as into school as we are.",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on the topic of how hard work and constant effort can help individuals achieve their goals.

I think we've all heard the saying ""Practice makes perfect,"" but have you ever stopped to think about how true that really is? I mean, think about it – if you're trying to get better at something, whether it's playing a sport, learning a new skill, or even just trying to be a better person, you're gonna have to put in the work to make it happen.

One of the best examples of this is inventors. Like, think about it – most of the time, the people who come up with the coolest, most game-changing inventions are the ones who have been working on them for years and years. They don't just sit around twiddling their thumbs, waiting for inspiration to strike – they put in the time and effort to make their dreams a reality.

And it's not just inventors – anyone can benefit from putting in the work. Like, if you want to get better at a sport, you're gonna have to practice regularly. If you want to get better at playing the guitar, you're gonna have to practice for hours every day. It's not gonna come easily, but if you keep at it, you'll see improvement.

But here's the thing – inactivity can also serve a purpose. Sometimes, taking a break and stepping back from something can actually help you come back to it with a fresh perspective and a newfound passion. Like, if you're working on a project and you're feeling stuck, taking a day or two off to relax and recharge can actually help you come back to it with renewed energy and creativity.

And it's not just individuals – companies can benefit from constant effort too. Like, think about it – the companies that are always striving to improve their products and services are the ones that are gonna be the most successful. They're not just sitting around doing the same old thing – they're always pushing themselves to be better, to innovate, and to stay ahead of the game.

"Recent studies on the effects of distance learning on students' learning outcomes have shown both pros and cons. On one hand, students who attend classes from home are able to learn in an environment that is tailored to their own individual learning styles. This can provide a more engaging learning experience compared to traditional classrooms, as students are in charge of their own learning pace and environment. 

However, students attending classes from home can suffer from issues concerning socialization, responsibility, and experience. Without face-to-face communication, many important learning and life skills such as team work, public speaking, and interpersonal communication are lost. Also, there is comparatively a lack of responsibility and guidance for progress when in an online setting.

Overall, the future of distance learning for students remains, at the very least, uncertain. For those who struggle to learn in a traditional setting, distance learning can provide a great alternative. Equally, traditional classrooms are still preferred by some for a number of reasons, such as social connection and assessment feedback. It is important that students are given the option to choose between the two learning methods in order to create an ideal learning environment.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"When considering the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that teamwork has certain advantages. For starters, when trying to tackle a complex problem or project, there is often more brain power within a group than an individual. Working in a group enables different individuals to come together and share their unique insights and perspectives, helping complete the task quickly and efficiently. Working in a group also allows people to divide the workload, so each individual is responsible for a certain component or task. This can help ensure that no one person is overwhelmed with too much work and hold the team accountable for completing their tasks in a timely manner.

Furthermore, working with others provides an opportunity for people to learn from each other. Discussions and brainstorming can help bring new and innovative ideas to the table and help everyone learn from each other. While working alone is beneficial in some cases, it is often more beneficial to have a group of people who are dedicated and motivated to work together towards a common goal. Working in a group also leads to a sense of community and collaboration, which can help build rapport between members. This helps create a supportive and encouraging environment, which can inspire individuals to continue working hard and reach their goals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that there are many benefits of working in a group versus working alone. From increased productivity and effort, to learning from each other and creating a sense of community, working in a group can help people to make progress on challenging projects, learn new skills, and work together towards a common goal.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"The invention of the telephone changed the world forever, ushering in a new era of communication. In the late 1800s, inventor Alexander Graham Bell debuted the prototype for the first practical telephone, allowing individuals to transmit their voice through a system of wires. Thus began the journey of what would become the ubiquitous device that powers long-distance conversations today. 

The progression of the telephone over the past century or so has been astounding. Advances in digital and networking technology have allowed for smaller, more powerful phones to be developed, as well as the incorporation of sophisticated features such as voicemail, texting, and phone apps. This has enabled users to stay connected with one another no matter where they are in the world. 

On one side, the telephone has had a largely positive effect on communication and relationships. People can now stay in contact over long distances, be a part of global conversations, and keep up with the news from around the world. On the other hand, it has also had some negative impacts. Technology has resulted in an overwhelming amount of media consumption, leading to an increase in stress and anxiety among users. It has also resulted in decreased attention spans and information overload, which can lead to a lack of focus. 

Overall, the invention of the telephone and its progression over the years has brought about both positive and negatives impacts on society. While its ability to keep people connected is undeniably valuable, it is important to be mindful of the negative effects of technology that it can create and take the necessary steps to mitigate them.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This statement highlights the importance of developing one's own personal identity and not conforming to societal expectations. In this essay, I will analyze Emerson's statement and reflect on my own experiences that have helped me develop my identity.

Firstly, Emerson's statement emphasizes the importance of not following the crowd and instead finding one's own path in life. This is something that I have learned through my own experiences. For example, when I was in middle school, I was always trying to fit in with my peers and conform to their expectations. However, I soon realized that this was not making me happy and I needed to find my own path in life. This led me to explore new hobbies and interests, such as writing and photography, which helped me discover my own passions and develop my own identity.

Secondly, my identity has also been shaped by the experiences I have had in my life. For instance, when I traveled to a different country, I was exposed to new cultures and ways of life. This experience helped me to broaden my perspective and develop a better understanding of myself and the world around me. Additionally, when I faced challenges and obstacles in my life, I learned valuable lessons and grew as a person. These experiences have helped me to develop a strong sense of self and have shaped my identity in a positive way.

Thirdly, becoming an individual person can be beneficial in many ways. For example, when you are true to yourself, you are able to live authentically and make decisions that are based on your own values and beliefs. This can lead to greater happiness and fulfillment in life. Additionally, when you are an individual person, you are able to stand up for what you believe in and make a positive impact on the world.

Finally, in order to achieve autonomy in my life, I plan to continue exploring new hobbies and interests, and to challenge myself to try new things. I also plan to surround myself with positive influences and people who support my growth and development. By doing so, I believe that I can become a better person and achieve greater autonomy in my life.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement about developing one's own personal identity is very relevant",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Having a positive attitude in life is incredibly significant to personal success. Having a positive attitude can help individuals to take on obstacles with enthusiasm and resilience. In the workplace, having a positive attitude can help to motivate, innovate, problem-solve, and lift the spirits of colleagues. A positive attitude is also especially beneficial during “times of need”, when one must face personal life crises with courage. A negative attitude can prevent one from prospering, as it can give rise to feelings of doubt, insecurity, and helplessness. Remaining optimistic and maintaining a positive outlook in “times of need” is essential for one’s emotional well-being and capacity to persevere. Ultimately, having a positive attitude leads to personal success, self-confidence, and a willingness to take risks, making it an invaluable asset for anyone seeking growth and progress in life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"When making decisions, it can be useful to consider advice from multiple people in different situations, as it can help provide a broad perspective. Having multiple viewpoints can help identify potential benefits and drawbacks that might otherwise be overlooked. For example, if making a career decision, receiving advice from a mentor in the profession, a current colleague, and a former classmate who once pursued the same option can provide a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the potential option. 

On the other hand, there can be drawbacks to receiving and considering advice from too many different people. Having multiple perspectives can be difficult to process all at once, and it might cause confusion and conflicting opinions. It is important to weigh each person's advice carefully, or else it could create too much doubt or indecision when making a choice.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey, so I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about online classes and how they can help out students who live far away. I know, I know, it's like super important and all that jazz. So, here are my thoughts.

First of all, let's talk about why kids might not be able to attend school in person. Maybe they live in a different city or state, or maybe they have a medical condition that makes it hard for them to be in a classroom. Whatever the reason, it's totally understandable that they might not be able to make it to school every day. But that doesn't mean they should miss out on learning!

That's where online classes come in. Like, think about it. If a student can't make it to school, they can still take classes online. They can log in from their own computer or tablet and learn from the comfort of their own home. It's like, totally flexible and stuff. And the best part is, they can still interact with their teachers and classmates, even if they're not in the same room. It's like, totally like being in a real class, but without the commute!

And it's not just about convenience. Online classes can also be really helpful for students who might be struggling in a particular subject. Maybe they need a little extra time to understand something, or maybe they need to review some stuff before they can move on. With online classes, they can take their time and go at their own pace. It's like, totally personalized learning, you know?

But, like, there are also some potential downsides to online classes. For one thing, students might not have as much face-to-face interaction with their teachers and classmates. And that can be, like, totally important for building relationships and stuff. Plus, online classes can be kind of isolating, especially if the student is taking classes from home. It's like, they might not have as much support from their teachers and classmates as they would in a regular classroom.

So, like, in conclusion, offering online classes or video conferencing to students who live far away can be, like, totally helpful for them. It's like, flexible and personalized learning, and it can help them catch",1,llama2_chat,2
"Hey there!  I mean, hey!  So, you wanna know why having a positive attitude is like, super important for success in life?  Well, let me tell ya! 

First off, having a positive attitude totally affects how people react to you. Like, if you're always grumpy and complaining, people might not wanna hang out with you as much.  But if you're always bright and cheerful, people are more likely to wanna be around you!  It's like, why would you wanna be around someone who's always bringing down the mood?  You wanna be around people who make you feel good, right? 

And it's not just about relationships!  Having a positive attitude also helps you solve problems way better!  Like, if you're trying to figure out a hard math problem, you're more likely to come up with a solution if you're in a good mood!  It's like, your brain is more flexible and can think of more creative solutions when you're feeling good! 

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But what about when things are really hard? How can a positive attitude help then?""  Well, let me tell ya, it's still super important!  Like, even when things are tough, having a positive attitude can help you find the silver lining!  It's like, you can still find something good in a bad situation, you know? 

And lastly, having a positive attitude makes you way more likely to achieve your goals and be happier!  Like, if you're always thinking positively, you're more likely to take risks and try new things!  And when you do achieve your goals, you'll be way happier!  It's like, you'll be way more satisfied with your life!

"Title: Strategies for Conserving Energy and Resources in Businesses and Schools

Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the depletion of natural resources and the negative impact of human activities on the environment. As a result, many businesses and schools have adopted strategies to conserve energy and resources. This essay will evaluate the effectiveness of a four-day workweek for conserving energy and resources, discuss the potential consequences of extending the school day by two hours, examine how students' and teachers' time is used when attending school five days per week for eight hours, and compare the energy and resources used when attending school five days per week for eight hours and four days per week for four hours.

The Four-Day Workweek

One strategy that businesses have adopted to conserve energy and resources is the four-day workweek. This concept has gained popularity in recent years, as more and more companies have realized the benefits of having their employees work fewer hours. By reducing the workweek, businesses can save on energy costs associated with maintaining the workplace, as well as reduce the carbon footprint of their employees' commutes. Additionally, a four-day workweek can lead to increased employee satisfaction and productivity, as employees have more time for personal and family activities.

However, there are potential drawbacks to the four-day workweek. For example, some businesses may struggle to meet deadlines or maintain productivity levels if their employees are working fewer hours. Additionally, employees may feel pressured to work longer hours on their days off to make up for the lost time, which could lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction.

The Extended School Day

Another strategy that schools have adopted to conserve energy and resources is the extended school day. This concept involves extending the school day by two hours, with the same number of days per week. The goal of this strategy is to provide students with more time for learning and academic activities, which can lead to improved academic performance and better outcomes for students.

However, there are potential drawbacks to the extended school day. For example, some students may struggle to adjust to the longer school day, which could lead to decreased motivation and engagement. Additionally, teachers may feel overwhelmed by the increased workload associated with the longer school day, which could lead to decreased job satisfaction and burnout.

Students' and Teachers' Time Use",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"The debate over reducing work hours for school teachers is one that has caused much contention in recent years. On the surface, it appears to be a reasonable notion; reducing the hours teachers spend in the classroom would limit their exposure to stress and provide more leisure time. However, this decision carries many far-reaching implications that ultimately make such a move inadvisable.

First and foremost, reducing teacher work hours would likely result in an increase in class sizes. This would lead to an overall decrease in the quality of education provided, as it becomes increasingly difficult for a teacher to manage a larger number of students. It would also add additional strain on teachers, who would be responsible for teaching more material to a larger class in reduced time frames.

In addition, fewer teacher work hours could lead to the primary instructors being asked to take on additional roles in the school, such as extracurricular activities and guidance support. This would detract from the crucial educational focuses of their role, and could lead to compromising standards as they would now be trying to manage more complex tasks in fewer work hours.

Lastly, reducing the amount of time teachers spend in the classroom could unintentionally devalue the profession as a whole. Teachers dedicate a great deal of time to their work and, by painting it as something that can be accomplished in a short amount of time, we risk giving the impression that it is a less worthy profession worth less than those requiring more working hours.

For these reasons, reducing work hours for school teachers is not a wise decision. While it may provide teachers with greater leisure time, it is important to weigh the implications and maintain the respect and integrity due to the education system.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Childhood, environment, and culture are all crucial factors that shape and affect a person's character. These elements work together to create a unique individual who is influenced by their experiences and surroundings. In this essay, I will explore how these factors shape and affect a person's character.

Childhood is a critical time in a person's life. During this period, individuals learn about the world around them and develop their personalities. The experiences and relationships that a person has during childhood can have a lasting impact on their character. For example, a child who grows up in a nurturing and supportive environment may develop a strong sense of empathy and compassion. On the other hand, a child who experiences neglect or abuse may develop a more guarded and defensive personality.

Environment also plays a significant role in shaping a person's character. The physical and social surroundings that a person is exposed to can influence their beliefs, values, and behavior. For instance, individuals who grow up in areas with high levels of poverty and crime may develop a more skeptical and distrusting outlook on life. On the other hand, those who grow up in safe and affluent environments may develop a more optimistic and trusting personality.

Culture is another essential factor that shapes and affects a person's character. Culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, and practices of a group of people. These beliefs and values can influence an individual's behavior and shape their character. For example, individuals who grow up in collectivist cultures may develop a strong sense of community and interdependence. On the other hand, those who grow up in individualistic cultures may develop a more independent and self-reliant personality.

In conclusion, childhood, environment, and culture are all critical factors that shape and affect a person's character. These elements work together to create a unique individual who is influenced by their experiences and surroundings. While these factors can have a significant impact on a person's personality, it is essential to remember that individuals have the power to shape their own character through their choices and actions. By being aware of these factors and their influence on our character, we can work towards becoming the best version of ourselves.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Many people face the difficult decision of choosing a career at a young age, and it can certainly be beneficial to start taking steps in a desired direction at a young age. For example, I know a teenaged girl who is already learning valuable skills in coding, which could give her an edge in future job markets. However, some argue that deciding a career path at an early age can lead to regret or lack of opportunity further down the line. Those who wait until later in life to get a degree or who change fields as they age often have a well-rounded understanding of the world and their particular interests, and can find more fulfilling work. My grandmother, for example, devoted most of her twenties to travel and charity work, and decided later to pursue a career in the art world. In conclusion, while it is possible to find success by selecting a career at a young age, it can also be beneficial to wait until later in life to gain a better understanding of the world and one's passions.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

"Technology has been both a blessing and a curse when it comes to humans. On one hand, it has allowed us to be more connected than ever before, with people around the world able to communicate quickly and easily. It has also enabled us to access vast amounts of knowledge, with just a few clicks of the mouse. In many ways, technology has made our lives easier and more convenient. 

On the other hand, technology has had some negative consequences. Studies have shown that too much time spent using technology can have a serious impact on our mental and physical health. For example, being constantly exposed to screens can lead to eye strain, headaches, fatigue, and poor posture. Additionally, some technologies have caused problems such as cyberbullying and data breaches, resulting in safety and security risks. 

Ultimately, the key to avoiding the potential negative effects of technology on humans is to use it in moderation. By limiting how much time we spend using these devices, we can reap the benefits of being connected without sacrificing our health or security.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey Principal [Name],

I think we should have to do community service. Like, a lot of it. Like, every week. And it should be mandatory. Here's why:

First of all, it's good for us. Like, it's good for us to help other people and stuff. It's like, the right thing to do. And it's not just about helping other people, it's about learning stuff too. Like, how to work with others, how to be responsible, how to be a good citizen. Stuff like that.

And it's not just about learning stuff, it's about feeling good too. Like, when you help someone, it makes you feel good inside. It's like, a happy feeling. And it's not just about the happy feeling, it's about knowing that you're making a difference. Like, you're actually helping someone, and that's cool.

And it's not just about helping people, it's about learning new things too. Like, I learned how to volunteer at the animal shelter last year, and it was so much fun! I got to play with the dogs and cats, and it was like, so cute. And I learned how to help them find homes too. It was so cool!

And it's not just about the animals, it's about the environment too. Like, we should help clean up the park and make it look nice. And it's not just about looking nice, it's about keeping it clean so that people can enjoy it. And it's not just about enjoying it, it's about taking care of it.

So, I think we should have to do community service. Like, every week. And it should be mandatory. Because it's good for us, and it's good for the community. And it's not just about the community, it's about the world. Like, we should help make the world a better place, and community service is one way to do that.

Thanks for reading my essay!

"Hey there!  So, I've been tasked with researching and comparing the benefits of distance learning versus traditional classroom learning. As an 8th grader, I'm like, super excited to dive into this topic and see which one comes out on top! 🤔

First off, let's talk about distance learning.  It's like, where you don't actually go to school in a classroom, but instead, you learn from home or wherever you want!  Like, you can watch videos, listen to lectures, and even take quizzes and tests online! It's like, super convenient, right? 😍

But, you know what's even better? Traditional classroom learning!  It's like, where you actually go to school with your friends and a teacher, and you get to learn stuff in a more hands-on way!  Like, you can ask questions, participate in discussions, and even get help from your teacher if you need it! 🤓

Now, here's where it gets interesting!  Some students might benefit more from distance learning, like those who have busy schedules or who live far away from school!  Like, imagine if you had a super important sports game or a family vacation planned, but you still wanted to keep learning!  With distance learning, you can do that! 🏈🏖️

On the other hand, some students might prefer traditional classroom learning!  Like, if you're the type of person who learns better with face-to-face interaction and hands-on activities, then traditional classroom learning might be the way to go!  Plus, you get to hang out with your friends and have a more structured learning environment! 🤝

So, there you have it!  Both distance learning and traditional classroom learning have their pros and cons, and different students might benefit from one or the other!  It's like, totally up to you to decide which one works best for you! 😃",1,llama2_chat,2
"Policy 1 and Policy 2 have many similarities, such as both focusing on improving the healthcare system. However, there are also some key differences between them. Policy 1 focuses on providing access to quality healthcare by mandating that all citizens have health insurance, while Policy 2 focuses on providing incentives to doctors to increase the number of people they treat.

In my opinion, Policy 1 is more beneficial in terms of reducing healthcare costs and increasing access to medical services. By requiring all citizens to purchase health insurance, the cost of healthcare can be spread out and made more affordable. Additionally, by mandating health insurance, more people would be able to access the healthcare they need.

On the other hand, Policy 2 is beneficial in terms of reducing the cost of healthcare services. By providing incentives to doctors, more people would be able to receive medical treatment and would be able to find a doctor more quickly. This would help reduce wait times and reduce the amount of money spent on medical costs.

Overall, I think both policies have their merits and can be used in tandem to improve the healthcare system. By providing incentives to doctors and requiring all citizens to purchase health insurance, both policies can work together to make healthcare more accessible and more affordable.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an 8th grader, I'm starting to think about my future career and what I want to do when I grow up. I've always been interested in science and technology, so I've been researching different careers and fields of study that align with my interests.

One career that I'm considering is software engineering. I think it would be really cool to design and create software that people use every day, like games or apps. I'm good at problem-solving and I enjoy learning new things, so I think I would be good at this job. Plus, there are a lot of different roles within the field, so I could specialize in the area that interests me the most.

To prepare for this career, I'm going to try to get some experience through internships or other educational resources. Maybe I can even take some coding classes or join a robotics club to learn more about programming. I've also heard that it's important to keep learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technology, so I'll make sure to keep reading and learning as much as I can.

Another career that I'm considering is aerospace engineering. I've always been fascinated by space and the universe, so I think it would be amazing to work on designing and building spaceships or other spacecraft. This field requires a lot of math and science skills, so I'll need to work hard to develop those areas. But I'm up for the challenge!

I think committing to a career at an early age has a lot of advantages. For one thing, it gives me a clear goal to work towards and helps me stay focused. It also gives me a chance to gain experience and build my skills, which will make me more competitive in the job market. Plus, the earlier I start, the more time I'll have to explore different careers and find the one that's right for me.

Overall, I'm excited to start exploring my options and seeing where my interests and skills take me. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready for the challenge!",1,llama2_chat,0
"Becoming your own self is a crucial aspect of achieving success and accomplishing your dreams. It is essential to understand that being true to yourself and your values is the key to a fulfilling and successful life. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of becoming your own self and how it leads to accomplishing your dreams.

Firstly, being true to yourself is essential in order to achieve your goals and aspirations. When you are not true to yourself, you are not able to fully understand your own motivations and desires. This can lead to confusion and frustration, as you may find yourself pursuing goals that are not truly meaningful to you. On the other hand, when you are true to yourself, you are able to identify your own passions and interests, and work towards achieving them with greater focus and determination.

Secondly, becoming your own self allows you to develop a strong sense of self-confidence. When you are true to yourself, you are able to trust your own instincts and make decisions that are in line with your values. This can lead to a greater sense of self-assuredness, as you are able to stand up for what you believe in and defend yourself against criticism or negativity. This confidence can be invaluable in achieving your goals and pursuing your dreams, as it allows you to take risks and overcome challenges with greater ease.

Finally, becoming your own self can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and happiness in life. When you are true to yourself, you are able to live in alignment with your values and beliefs, which can bring a sense of peace and contentment. Additionally, when you are able to achieve your goals and pursue your dreams, you are able to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in yourself. This can be a powerful motivator, as it encourages you to continue working towards your goals and striving for excellence in all areas of your life.

In conclusion, becoming your own self is essential for achieving success and accomplishing your dreams. It allows you to understand your own motivations and desires, develop a strong sense of self-confidence, and find fulfillment and happiness in life. I encourage all students to embrace their true selves and work towards achieving their goals with determination and focus.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"It’s easy to feel overwhelmed with the thought that our lives are supposed to be something other than they are. Our society has inundated us with images of ‘perfect’ lives, each one more unattainable than the last. It’s no wonder that so many people are trying to be something they’re not—and then feeling unhappy and unfulfilled when they fail. We judge ourselves against an arbitrary standard of material wealth, beauty, and success that can lead to a damaging cycle of self-judgment. 

As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” People would be better off if they relearned to accept and value their true selves rather than striving to live up to some unattainable definition of perfection. We can and should be critical of ourselves in order to improve, but we must keep the correct perspective: we are unique and special, just as we are, and no amount of external accomplishment is necessary to validate us.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"First impressions are a crucial aspect of our lives. They are the initial judgments we make about someone or something based on our first encounter. These impressions can have a significant impact on our interactions with people and can even affect our decision-making processes. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of first impressions and provide an example from my own experience.

First impressions are important because they can influence our behavior and attitudes towards a person or situation. For example, if we meet someone who seems friendly and approachable, we are more likely to engage in conversation with them and seek them out for future interactions. On the other hand, if we meet someone who seems cold or unfriendly, we may avoid them and not seek them out for future interactions.

First impressions can also impact our decision-making processes. For instance, if we meet someone who seems trustworthy and reliable, we may be more likely to trust them with important information or tasks. Conversely, if we meet someone who seems untrustworthy or unreliable, we may be less likely to trust them with important information or tasks.

One example from my own experience that highlights the importance of first impressions is my experience with my first job interview. When I walked into the interview room, I immediately noticed that the interviewer seemed stern and unapproachable. I felt nervous and unsure of myself, and I struggled to make a good impression. Despite my best efforts, I did not get the job.

After the interview, I realized that my first impression of the interviewer had played a significant role in my performance. If I had been able to make a better first impression, I may have been more confident and comfortable during the interview, which could have led to a better outcome.

In conclusion, first impressions are an important aspect of our lives. They can influence our behavior and attitudes towards people and situations, and can even impact our decision-making processes. It is important to be aware of our first impressions and to strive to make positive ones, as they can have a significant impact on our lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0

"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that outdoor activities are extremely beneficial for both physical and mental health. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of riding a bike, playing sports, and taking a walk, and why these activities are essential for a healthy lifestyle.

Firstly, riding a bike is a great way to improve physical fitness. Biking is a low-impact exercise that is easy on the joints and can be done by people of all ages. It is also a great way to get some fresh air and enjoy the beauty of nature. Biking can be done alone or with friends, making it a social activity as well.

Secondly, playing sports is another excellent way to improve physical fitness. Participating in sports such as soccer, basketball, or football can help improve cardiovascular health, build strength and endurance, and promote healthy habits. Additionally, playing sports can be a great way to socialize with others and develop teamwork skills.

Lastly, taking a walk is a simple yet effective way to improve mental health. Walking can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve overall mood. It can also be a great way to clear the mind and focus on the present moment. Walking can be done alone or with friends, making it a social activity as well.

In conclusion, outdoor activities such as riding a bike, playing sports, and taking a walk are essential for a healthy lifestyle. These activities can improve physical fitness, promote mental health, and provide social opportunities. As an 8th-grade student, I encourage my peers to engage in outdoor activities and make them a regular part of their daily routine.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that attending classes from home has its advantages and disadvantages. While students may be more comfortable in their own environment, it can also lead to negative impacts on their learning. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why students are not suited to attend classes from home and the potential impacts this can have on their learning.

Firstly, attending classes from home can lead to a lack of motivation and discipline. When students are in a physical classroom, they are surrounded by their peers and teachers, which can help to motivate them to participate and complete their work. However, when students are in their own homes, they may be more likely to procrastinate and not take their studies as seriously. Additionally, the lack of structure and routine can make it difficult for students to stay on track with their work.

Secondly, attending classes from home can lead to a lack of social interaction. Students learn a lot from their peers and teachers, and this social interaction is essential for their development. When students are in a physical classroom, they have the opportunity to ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate with their peers. However, when students are in their own homes, they may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers and teachers. This lack of social interaction can make it difficult for students to develop important social skills and can also lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.

Finally, attending classes from home can lead to a lack of accountability. When students are in a physical classroom, they are held accountable for their actions and their work. They have to complete assignments and participate in class discussions, and if they do not perform well, they will receive feedback from their teachers. However, when students are in their own homes, they may feel like they can get away with not completing their work or not participating in class discussions. This lack of accountability can lead to a lack of progress in their studies and can also make it difficult for them to develop important life skills such as responsibility and self-discipline.

In conclusion, while attending classes from home has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages. Students may be less motivated, lack social interaction, and have less accountability when studying from home. These negative impacts can have a significant impact on their learning and their overall development. Therefore, I believe that it is important for students to attend classes in person, where they",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"require more flexibility in their schedules or those who have difficulty attending traditional classes due to physical or mental health issues.

6. Provide examples of how distance learning has been successful for different types of students, such as those who have been able to balance their academic and personal lives more effectively or those who have been able to learn at their own pace without the pressure of keeping up with their peers.

7. Discuss the importance of providing adequate support and resources for students in a distance learning environment, such as access to online tutoring and academic advising, as well as opportunities for social interaction and community building.

8. Conclude by emphasizing the potential benefits of distance learning for students, while also acknowledging the need for careful planning and implementation to ensure that the system is effective and equitable for all students.

In conclusion, distance learning has both advantages and disadvantages for students. While it offers convenience and autonomy, it can also lead to a lack of motivation and ability to focus. However, there are certain types of students who would benefit greatly from distance learning, such as those who require more flexibility in their schedules or those who have difficulty attending traditional classes due to physical or mental health issues.

Providing adequate support and resources is crucial in a distance learning environment, as students need access to online tutoring and academic advising, as well as opportunities for social interaction and community building. By carefully planning and implementing the system, distance learning has the potential to be a valuable tool for students, helping them to balance their academic and personal lives more effectively and learn at their own pace without the pressure of keeping up with their peers.

In summary, distance learning can be a beneficial option for certain types of students, but it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages and provide adequate support and resources to ensure its effectiveness and equity.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Ummm, heck yeah!  So, like, you want me to write about Generic City in Uzbekistan?  I mean, I'm not exactly sure where that is, but I'll give it my best shot! 😅

Okay, so after some research (and by research, I mean I randomly searched for stuff on Google), I found out that Generic City is actually a real place! It's located in Uzbekistan, which is a country in Central Asia.  I didn't know that, did you? 🤔

Anyway, back to Generic City! It's got a pretty cool history, I guess. Like, did you know that it was founded in the 19th century by some Russian dude?  I don't know, man, it's just so... generic.  But, I guess it's got some pretty neat buildings, like the Generic City Palace and the Uzbekistan Museum.  They're, uh, pretty generic-looking, but I guess they're important or something. 😅

It's like, these fluffy, soft, warm...  I could just... 

In conclusion, Generic City is pretty cool, I guess.  It's got history, buildings, and food... what more could you want?  I mean, it's not like it's the most interesting place in the world or anything, but it's... generic.  And that's what makes it kinda cool, right?",1,llama2_chat,4

"Hey there!  So, the question is, should young students commit to a career? Like, right now?  I mean, I'm only in 8th grade, but I've been thinking about this a lot lately. 

Pros of committing to a career early on, you know, are that it gives you a sense of direction and purpose. Like, you know what you want to do when you grow up, and you can start working towards it right away.  It's like, you're not just floating through life without any goals or anything. 

But, on the other hand,  committing to a career too early can be, like, super limiting.  What if you change your mind?  What if you discover something else you're passionate about?  It's like, you might miss out on other opportunities or experiences. 

For example, like, my friend Joey wants to be a professional gamer.  Like, that's cool and all, but he's only in 7th grade.  I don't know if he'll be able to make it happen.  Maybe he'll change his mind or something. 

Another thing to consider is that,  well, some careers require like, a ton of education and training.  Like, you might have to go to college or something, and that's just,  so much work.  I don't know if I could handle it. 

So, in conclusion,  I think it's important to keep an open mind and not commit to a career too early.  You never know what you might discover or what opportunities might come your way.  Just, you know, don't be like Joey and try to be a pro gamer at 12. *laughs",1,llama2_chat,1
"It is important to consider alternative extracurricular activities to the more commonly known activities such as sports, yearbook making, and student counciling. Activities such as art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer studies, science, math, reading, and writing have many benefits, such as fostering creativity, teaching valuable skills, and expanding a student’s knowledge. However, it is important to consider the drawbacks as well, such as potential distractions or lack of recognition. It is also important to understand the opinions of students who do not wish to participate in any of the extracurricular activities. Therefore, a recommendation for the principal should include a variety of extracurricular activities, including activities that can allow for creativity, such as art and music. Furthermore, there should be activities that provide an opportunity for students to learn valuable skills, such as computer studies and chess club. Finally, some extracurricular activities should allow for knowledge expansion, such as science and math.

"Hey there! So, I'm super stoked to be writing this essay about Thomas Jefferson's quote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I mean, who doesn't love a good quote that's all about being productive and not being bored, right? 😅

So, I started researching and found out that Thomas Jefferson was like, totally right. Being idle can be super bad for you, both physically and mentally. Like, did you know that sitting for too long can increase your risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease? 😱 And if you're feeling bored, it can lead to depression and anxiety. No thanks! 🙅‍♀️

But don't worry, there are plenty of ways to stay active and not be bored! 🎉 Going to the gym is a great way to get fit and healthy. Exercise can help boost your mood, increase your energy levels, and even improve your sleep.

"Sure, here's my essay on whether the length of summer vacation for high school students should be changed:

Summer vacation is one of the most anticipated times of the year for high school students. It's a time to relax, recharge, and have fun with friends and family. However, the current length of summer vacation, which is typically around 3 months, has been a topic of debate among educators and students alike. Some argue that the length of summer vacation should be shorter, while others believe it should remain the same. In my opinion, the length of summer vacation should be changed, and here's why.

Firstly, a shorter summer vacation would allow students to have more time to focus on their studies during the school year. With a shorter summer break, students would have more time to review and reinforce the material they learned during the previous school year, which would help them perform better in their classes. Additionally, they would have more time to prepare for standardized tests and college entrance exams, which are crucial for their future academic and professional success.

Secondly, a shorter summer vacation would provide students with more opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities and internships. Many students use their summer vacation to participate in sports, music, or art programs, which help them develop their interests and skills. However, with a longer summer break, these opportunities may be limited, as many programs have shorter sessions or require students to commit to a longer period of time. By reducing the length of summer vacation, students would have more chances to participate in these activities, which could help them develop their passions and explore their career options.

Lastly, a shorter summer vacation could help reduce the summer learning loss that many students experience. Research has shown that students tend to forget some of the material they learned during the school year over the summer months, which can negatively impact their academic performance in the following school year. By reducing the length of summer vacation, students would have less time to forget what they learned, which could help them maintain their academic skills and performance.

However, some people argue that a shorter summer vacation would be detrimental to students' well-being. They claim that students need time to relax and recharge after a long school year, and that a shorter summer",1,llama2_chat,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that parents and teachers play a significant role in shaping the lives of young people. They have a tremendous impact on our development, and their influence can be seen in various aspects of our lives.

My parents have been a significant influence on my life. They have taught me valuable life lessons and have been a constant source of support and guidance. For example, my father has always encouraged me to pursue my passions and never give up on my dreams. He has taught me the importance of hard work and dedication, and his unwavering support has helped me to overcome many challenges in my life. My mother, on the other hand, has taught me the importance of empathy and kindness. She has always been there for me when I needed someone to listen and has taught me to be compassionate towards others.

Teachers have also played a crucial role in my life. They have been instrumental in shaping my academic and personal growth. One of my teachers, Mrs. Johnson, has been a significant influence on my life. She has taught me the importance of perseverance and has always encouraged me to strive for excellence. She has been a mentor to me and has helped me to develop my critical thinking skills. Through her guidance, I have been able to overcome many academic challenges and have grown as a person.

In my opinion, it is essential to always have goals, regardless of how challenging they may seem. Goals provide direction and purpose in our lives. They help us to focus our efforts and to stay motivated. When we set goals for ourselves, we are more likely to achieve them, and this sense of accomplishment can be incredibly rewarding.

One specific goal that I have set for myself is to become a successful entrepreneur. I plan on achieving this goal by studying hard in school, gaining experience through internships, and seeking out mentorship from successful entrepreneurs. I believe that with hard work and dedication, I can turn my dream into a reality.

In conclusion, parents and teachers play a significant role in shaping the lives of young people. They provide guidance, support, and encouragement, and their influence can be seen in various aspects of our lives. It is essential to always have goals, regardless of how challenging they may seem, as they provide direction and purpose in our lives.

"When it comes to deceptive behaviors, one example is when someone changes their appearance or behavior in order to impress or get something from someone else. For example, if a person is trying to get a job, they may dress more professionally than their usual style, in order to leave a better first impression on their potential employer. Additionally, when individuals feel left out of a group, their behavior can change drastically in order to impress or be accepted by the group, and it can be evident through their tone, body language or even words used. Furthermore, first impressions may give you a good indication of a person's trustworthiness and ability. When observing someone for the first time, the nonverbal behavior, such as facial expressions and physical movements, can be a good indication of a person's true intentions. Overall, it is important to take into consideration these deceptive behaviors as they can potentially give away hints as to what a person may be trying to accomplish.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Technology has become an integral part of our lives. From smartphones to computers, it has transformed the way we communicate, work, and live. While technology has brought many benefits, it has also had its share of negative effects. In this essay, I will explore the effects of technology on people's lives, discussing both its positive and negative effects.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is the way it has revolutionized communication. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, people can now connect with each other from anywhere in the world in real-time. This has made it easier for people to keep in touch with their loved ones, collaborate with colleagues, and form new relationships. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to access vast amounts of information quickly and easily. This has led to increased knowledge and education, which has helped people make better decisions and improve their lives.

However, technology has also had its share of negative effects. One of the most significant concerns is the impact of technology on our mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of technology can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. This is because technology can be addictive, and people may become isolated from others if they spend too much time on their devices. Additionally, technology has led to a decline in physical activity, which can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.

Another negative effect of technology is the impact it has had on our work lives. While technology has made it easier for people to work remotely, it has also led to increased stress and burnout. This is because people may feel like they are always connected to work, and they may struggle to disconnect and recharge. Additionally, technology has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which can make it harder for people to build relationships and collaborate effectively.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives. While it has brought many benefits, it has also had its share of negative effects. It is important for people to be aware of these effects and take steps to mitigate them. This may include limiting the amount of time spent on technology, taking breaks to disconnect and recharge, and prioritizing physical activity and face-to-face communication. By doing so, people can harness the power of technology to improve their lives while also avoiding its negative effects.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Hey there!  So, you wanna know about attitudes and stuff?  Well, let me tell ya, having a good attitude is like, super important in life. Like, it can make or break you, you know?

First of all, having a positive attitude can do wonders for you. It can help you achieve your goals, make new friends, and even get better grades in school. When you're positive and optimistic, you're more likely to take risks and try new things, which can lead to great opportunities. Plus, it's way more fun to be around people who are happy and cheerful, you know? They just brighten up the whole room! 

But, on the other hand, having a bad attitude can be, like, super toxic. It can make you miss out on things, hurt your relationships, and even make you feel sad and lonely. When you're always complaining and negative, people don't wanna be around you, and that's just not cool. 

So, how can you control your attitude? Well, it's all about mindset, man. You gotta learn to focus on the good things in life, even when things are tough. Like, when I'm doing my math homework, I try to think about how cool it is that I'm learning something new, instead of complaining about how hard it is. And when I'm hanging out with my friends, I try to be supportive and listen to them, instead of always talking about myself. 

Also, practicing gratitude can do wonders for your attitude. Like, take a minute each day to think about all the things you're thankful for. It can be something small, like a good breakfast, or something big, like your family. When you focus on what you have, instead of what you don't have, it can totally change your perspective.

Plus, we can communicate with our friends and family super easily through social media and messaging apps. It's like, we can be besties no matter where we are in the world! 💕

"Online schooling has become increasingly popular over the past decade, as students and parents alike have begun to explore the potential benefits that it offers. On the positive side, online schooling can give students the opportunity to work at their own pace and learn at a time and location that works best for them. It also allows for more personalized instruction from teachers, tailored educational experiences, and improved communication with teachers and peers. On the other hand, online schooling also carries some drawbacks. For instance, it can be difficult for students to stay motivated and focused without classroom structure and support, which can lead to higher dropout rates. Additionally, online schooling does not provide the same level of social and emotional support which students often need to thrive. 

In conclusion, whether or not online schooling is a good idea for students depends on their individual goals and circumstances. With the right supports in place, online schooling can give students the opportunity to learn at their own pace and customize their educational experience to fit their needs. However, those same students also run the risk of losing focus and motivation without the structure and community of a traditional school.

"Sure, here's my essay on the pros and cons of starting a career at a young age:

Starting a career at a young age can have both positive and negative effects. Some people believe that it's better to start working early to gain experience and build a strong foundation for the future, while others argue that it can lead to burnout and a lack of balance in life.

One of the main pros of starting a career at a young age is that it allows individuals to gain valuable experience and build a strong foundation for their future. For example, doctors and lawyers often start their careers in their 20s or 30s after completing their medical or legal training. This early start gives them a head start in their field and allows them to develop their skills and knowledge more quickly. Additionally, starting a career early can lead to faster career advancement and higher earning potential.

However, there are also some cons to starting a career at a young age. One of the main drawbacks is the risk of burnout. When individuals start their careers too early, they may be overworked and underpaid, leading to stress and exhaustion. This can negatively impact their mental and physical health, as well as their relationships with friends and family. Additionally, starting a career too early can limit an individual's opportunities for personal growth and development.

Another con of starting a career at a young age is that it can limit an individual's ability to explore other interests and passions. When individuals are focused solely on their careers, they may miss out on other experiences that could help them grow as a person. For example, taking time off to travel or pursue a hobby can help individuals develop new skills and perspectives that can benefit them in their career.

In conclusion, starting a career at a young age can have both positive and negative effects. While it can provide valuable experience and a strong foundation for the future, it can also lead to burnout and a lack of balance in life. Ultimately, the decision to start a career at a young age should be based on individual circumstances and goals. It's important to weigh the pros and cons carefully and make an informed decision that works best for you.",1,llama2_chat,0

"Excerpt:

Throughout history, failure has often been the precursor to success, and Winston Churchill is famously quoted for remarking that “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This simple quotation succinctly illustrates an important truth- failure should not be feared, but embraced. It is difficult to succeed without first having failed. To better understand this concept, it is important to consider two main reasons why failure can lead to success. 

First, failure can often provide valuable insight and guidance in our lives. The knowledge that one gains through failing can help them to better equip themselves for future success. For example, Thomas Edison famously remarked that failure taught him a thousand ways not to build a lightbulb. This perspective allowed him to look at each instance of failure as a lesson, rather than an impediment to success. Another example of this notion is when Oprah Winfrey failed a major quiz in high school. Though originally considering it a disappointment, Oprah remarked later that “it was the best thing”, as it changed her attitude towards learning and inspired her to take courses she was genuinely passionate about.

Second, failure can provide an emotional sense of resilience that is necessary for success. Those that can effectively learn from their mistakes and use their failures as a source of motivation can become more resilient. As an example of this, Michael Jordan was famously cut from his high school basketball team, but through hard work and dedication he became one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Another case in point is J.K. Rowling, who got several rejections in her attempt to find a publisher for her now renowned book Harry Potter. However, she persevered and eventually found someone who believed in her story and was willing to take a chance. 

All in all, failure is a concept that should not be feared, but seen as an important stepping stone to achieving ultimate success. It plays a pivotal role in helping us to develop qualities such as resilience in order to reach our goals. Thus, it is important to remember Winston Churchill's words- that success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey there!  So, I guess you want me to write about how behavior can influence other people and the consequences of modeling bad behavior to kids. 

First of all, let's talk about how our actions can affect others. Like, if we're always late to class, our friends might start to think it's okay to be late too. Or, if we're mean to our siblings, they might start treating others poorly as well. It's like, we're setting an example for them, you know? And if we're not careful, they might just follow in our footsteps. 

But, oh man, the potential consequences of modeling bad behavior to kids are serious!  If they grow up thinking it's okay to be rude or disrespectful, they might have a hard time making friends or even getting a job someday. And let's not forget about the long-term effects of having a bad record.  Imagine trying to travel abroad with a criminal record. It's like, good luck getting into any country!  ""Sorry, you can't enter our country because you were mean to your little brother once."" 

So, it's super important that we teach kids good behavior. Like, we need to show them how to be kind and respectful to others, even when no one is watching. And it's not just about being good, it's about being responsible. If we teach them to take responsibility for their actions, they'll be more likely to make good choices in the future. 

But here's the thing, educating kids on good behavior isn't just about them, it's about the entire society.  If we can raise a generation of kind and responsible kids, we can create a better world!  Think about it, if everyone was nice to each other and respected each other's feelings, we wouldn't have so much conflict and bullying.

"Graduating from high school in three years can be an attractive option for certain students looking to jumpstart their education or careers. It may allow them to enter the workforce earlier, potentially providing more job prospects or enhancing the ability to get into top colleges. However, completing high school in such a short period of time also has its drawbacks. There are various challenges to consider such as having to forego certain extracurricular activities and making sure the necessary academic criteria is met. 

For example, a student who wishes to graduate early may need to double up on certain classes or even sacrifice certain electives. This could limit their exposure to different fields of study and potentially reduce their future college options. Furthermore, the intense workload demanded by an accelerated graduation schedule can lead to greater levels of stress which can take its toll on a student both mentally and physically.

Overall, graduating from high school in three years can be beneficial in a variety of ways, but it's important to weigh all the necessary requirements and possible drawbacks. It can be a great option for some students, but it's important to consider the long-term effects that it could have on their studies and future career.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

This statement highlights the importance of individuality and pursuing one's own dreams, rather than following the crowd or conforming to societal expectations.

One of the key ways to achieve success is by following your dreams and pursuing your passions. When you are passionate about something, you are more likely to put in the effort and dedication required to master it. This can lead to a sense of fulfillment and purpose, which can be motivating and inspiring. Additionally, when you are pursuing something that you are truly interested in, you are more likely to be innovative and creative, which can help you stand out from the competition.

However, it is important to remember that not everyone will support your dreams and aspirations. There will be negative people who try to bring you down and discourage you from pursuing your passions. These people may be jealous or fearful of your success, or they may simply not understand your vision. It is important to recognize when someone is trying to bring you down and to ignore them. Instead, focus on your own goals and aspirations, and let your own passion and determination guide you.

While it is important to follow your own dreams, it is also important to seek advice and guidance from others. While it is important to be independent and self-reliant, it is also important to recognize that others may have valuable insights and perspectives that can help you achieve your goals. Seeking advice from others can help you identify potential obstacles and challenges, and can provide you with strategies and tactics for overcoming them.

Finally, it is important to remember the power of positive words and language. When you speak positively and confidently, you are more likely to inspire and motivate others. This can help you build a strong support system and can provide you with the encouragement and motivation you need to achieve your goals.

In conclusion, the key to success in life is to master something beyond the ordinary and to pursue your own dreams. While it is important to ignore negative people and focus on your own goals, it is also important to seek advice and guidance from others. Additionally, the",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Online classes are a great benefit to students who are balancing a career, family commitments, and those living in remote locations. Students with jobs are able to take classes around their schedules without the need to travel to a campus, making it easier for them to finish a degree. Students with family commitments have the flexibility to move at their own pace, completing classes around their existing schedule. Online classes also benefit those living in remote areas, since they can access courses they may not have access to otherwise. Therefore, online classes can provide a level of convenience and flexibility that could not be achieved on a campus.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"First impressions are powerful. We all know that first impressions are often hard to change and can often lead to inaccurate assumptions made about a person's character and habits. The reality is, however, that first impressions can and often do change over time. For example, consider two strangers who meet for the first time. The initial impression one has of the other is usually based mostly on physical appearance, and even the briefest of interactions. However, as time goes on, if these two strangers share more interactions and get to know each other better, the initial impressions they had of each other can and do change. Even something as simple as a conversation or a shared interest can lead to drastically different vies of each other. 

To further illustrate this, consider the workplace environment. It is not unusual for individuals to develop better relationships with their colleagues and supervisors over time. Initially, someone may have a less than stellar view of their coworkers or boss. However, once an extended period of interactions has passed, the relationship and overall impression of each other can change for the better.

In conclusion, first impressions may be hard to change, but it is possible. With enough effort, positive interactions, and time, it is definitely possible to alter one's initial views of another.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Changing the cafeteria food for students at a school can have several potential negative outcomes. First, students may not like the new food options and may refuse to eat them. This can lead to malnutrition and a decrease in overall health for the students. Additionally, if the new food options are more expensive, some students may not be able to afford them and may have to bring their own lunches or skip meals altogether. This can lead to a decrease in academic performance and overall well-being.

Another potential negative outcome of changing the cafeteria food is that it may disrupt the school's schedule. If the new food options require longer preparation times or if there are fewer options available, it may take longer for students to eat and get back to class. This can lead to a decrease in productivity and a decrease in the amount of time students have for studying and other activities.

Finally, changing the cafeteria food may also have a negative impact on the school's budget. If the new food options are more expensive, it may put a strain on the school's finances. Additionally, if the new food options are not well-received by students, it may lead to a decrease in sales and a decrease in revenue for the school.

In conclusion, changing the cafeteria food for students at a school can have several potential negative outcomes. It is important for the school to carefully consider the potential impacts of any changes and to take steps to mitigate any negative effects.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an 8th grader, I have to say that technology has had a huge impact on our social relations. On one hand, it's made it easier for us to connect with each other and share our thoughts and ideas. Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat have given us a way to express ourselves and connect with others who share similar interests. We can also use technology to stay in touch with our friends and family who live far away.

But on the other hand, technology has also had some negative impacts on our social relations. For example, social media can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying and online harassment. It can also make us feel lonely and isolated, even when we're surrounded by people. Sometimes, I find myself spending more time staring at my phone than actually interacting with people face-to-face.

Another thing that's really interesting to think about is how technology affects our identity. Social media can shape the way we present ourselves to the world, and it can be hard to know what's real and what's just a carefully curated image. It's like, I can be myself online, but sometimes I feel like I'm losing myself in the process. And it's not just us, but also our parents and teachers who are struggling to keep up with the fast-changing world of technology.

Speaking of parents, they're always telling us to be more productive and focused, but sometimes technology can make it hard to do that. With so many distractions online, it's easy to get sucked into the vortex of social media and never get anything done. And let's not forget about the risks associated with technology misuse. Like, have you heard of deepfakes? They're like fake videos or images that are so realistic, they can be used to manipulate people. That's super scary.

But you know what's even scarier? The fact that kids our age are spending so much time on their phones and tablets. It's like, we're missing out on all the fun stuff, like playing outside and reading books and stuff. And it's not just our mental health that suffers, but also our physical health.

"Praising students when their work has not yet reached its full potential has both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, praising students for their effort can boost their self-confidence and encourage them to persist in the face of disappointment. It can also serve as a way of rewarding a student for engagement with the task, regardless of outcome. On the other hand, praise which is given too freely can result in students forming the belief that hollow compliments will be rewarded, instead of hard work. It can also lead to unrealistic expectations about performance, creating a false sense of confidence which will inevitably be crushed in the face of more significant challenges. 

When used in moderation, however, praising students for effort can be beneficial. Rather than expecting students to always achieve an ""A"" grade, recognizing worthy effort helps to foster a growth mindset, enabling students to realize that mistakes and failures are part of the learning process. It also encourages positive self-reflection, with students becoming more self-aware and mindful of the work that has been put in. 

Overall, it is clear that praising students for their efforts, even when their work has not reached its full potential, is a delicate balance. Used constructively, it can motivate and reward, but overused it can create excessive expectations and detract from meaningful learning.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey there, it's me, an average 8th grade student!  I'm super excited to write this essay about the importance of asking for help and guidance, talking to priors and family members, and having confidence in yourself when making important life decisions. Here are some scenarios that I think really illustrate my points:

Scenario 1: Choosing a High School

So, I'm in 8th grade and it's time to think about high schools. My parents are like, ""Hey, kiddo, you gotta start thinking about where you wanna go to high school!"" And I'm like, ""Uh, I don't know...where do I wanna go?""  My parents are like, ""Well, have you thought about this school or that school?"" And I'm like, ""Uh, no...I don't know anything about them."" It's like, I'm supposed to have all these opinions and ideas, but I don't! 

So, I ask my parents for help and guidance. They're like, ""Okay, let's do some research together!"" And we look up schools online and talk to friends who went to different schools. My parents help me think about what's important to me, like location and extracurriculars, and we narrow it down together. It's like, having them there to guide me makes me feel so much more confident in my decision. I'm like, ""Oh, I get it now!  I can't wait to go to high school!""

Scenario 2: Deciding on a College Major

So, I'm in college now and I'm like, ""Okay, what do I wanna major in?"" And my parents are like, ""Well, what are you interested in?"" And I'm like, ""Uh...I don't know...I'm good at math and science, but I also like writing and stuff.""  It's like, I don't know what I want to do with my life! 

But my parents are like, ""Don't worry, we'll help you figure it out!"" And we talk about",1,llama2_chat,0
"Partnerships between schools and companies have become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. These partnerships offer a range of benefits to students, including the opportunity to learn about different work environments, acquire necessary job skills, and understand job requirements. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of these partnerships and how they can help students prepare for the future.

One of the most significant benefits of partnerships between schools and companies is the opportunity for students to learn about different work environments. These partnerships allow students to visit companies and observe how they operate, meet with professionals in the field, and learn about the different types of jobs that are available. This exposure to different work environments can help students make more informed decisions about their future career paths and help them identify areas where they may be interested in pursuing further education or training.

Another benefit of these partnerships is the opportunity for students to acquire necessary job skills. Many companies offer training programs or internships for students, which can help them develop the skills they need to succeed in the workforce. These skills can range from technical skills, such as computer programming or data analysis, to soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. By participating in these programs, students can gain a competitive edge in the job market and increase their chances of finding employment after graduation.

Finally, partnerships between schools and companies can help students understand job requirements. Many companies participate in these partnerships to help recruit future employees, and they often provide information about the skills and qualifications that are required for different positions. This information can be invaluable for students, as it can help them tailor their education and training to meet the needs of the job market. By understanding job requirements, students can increase their chances of finding employment and succeeding in their chosen careers.

In conclusion, partnerships between schools and companies offer a range of benefits to students. These partnerships allow students to learn about different work environments, acquire necessary job skills, and understand job requirements. By participating in these programs, students can gain a competitive edge in the job market and increase their chances of finding employment after graduation. As such, I believe that these partnerships are an important tool for preparing students for the future and helping them succeed in the workforce.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Working in a group or alone has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people prefer to work alone, others believe that working in a group is more beneficial. In my opinion, working in a group has more benefits than working alone.

One of the most significant benefits of working in a group is time management. When working alone, it can be challenging to manage time effectively. There are no deadlines or accountability, which can lead to procrastination and poor time management. On the other hand, when working in a group, there are deadlines and accountability. This means that group members are more likely to stay on track and manage their time effectively.

Another benefit of working in a group is gaining new information. When working alone, it can be challenging to gain new information. There are no different perspectives or ideas to consider. However, when working in a group, there are different perspectives and ideas to consider. This can lead to a more well-rounded understanding of the topic and a more creative solution to the problem.

Faster work is another benefit of working in a group. When working alone, it can take longer to complete a task. This is because there is no one to bounce ideas off of or to help with the task. However, when working in a group, there are more people to bounce ideas off of and to help with the task. This can lead to faster work and a more efficient solution to the problem.

Finally, working in a group can lead to making new friends. When working alone, it can be challenging to make new friends. There are no opportunities to interact with other people. However, when working in a group, there are opportunities to interact with other people. This can lead to new friendships and a more social environment.

In conclusion, working in a group has more benefits than working alone. Time management, gaining new information, faster work, and making new friends are just a few of the benefits. While some people prefer to work alone, the benefits of working in a group are too great to ignore.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Character is often said to define who we are as individuals, but should we choose these traits for ourselves or be shaped and molded by outside forces? There is much debate surrounding this issue, and it is important to consider both sides before making a decision.

On the one hand, there are those who believe that character traits should be chosen independently. Self-determination allows us to make our own decisions, and makes us agents of change in our own lives. Moreover, it also allows us to establish our values and follow our own moral compass. By taking this approach, we can be assured that our character is shaped by the person we decide to be. An example of this can be seen in the way people choose to use their resources in different ways to achieve certain goals.

On the other hand, it is argued that character traits should be shaped, in part, by outside influences. External experiences, both good and bad, can shape and influence our character. Culture, family, and other external influences can all contribute to our values and way of life. Proponents of this approach argue that these experiences are necessary in order to help shape and refine our character. An example of this is how people from different cultures have varying perspectives on certain issues.

Ultimately, it is up to us to decide how our character is shaped and molded. We have the freedom of choice and the power to change the course of our lives. We can support positive external influences while maintaining our own autonomy and individuality. As long as we make conscious decisions about our character traits, we can shape our lives in a way that is best for us.

In conclusion, when it comes to our character traits, we have the power to determine our own destiny. We can draw from the values of those that have influenced us, or we can create our own unique character and determine our own fate. It is up to us to decide which approach is best for our lives, and we have the freedom to choose our own character traits.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Character traits are the inherent qualities that define a person, such as honesty, kindness, and intelligence. Some people believe that we should choose our own character traits, while others believe that they are shaped by influences beyond our control. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and argue that our character traits are shaped by a combination of our own choices and external influences.

On the one hand, some people believe that we have complete control over our character traits. They argue that our choices and actions shape our personality, and that we can consciously choose to develop certain traits. For example, if someone wants to become more confident, they can practice public speaking, take on new challenges, and seek feedback from others. By making these choices, they can develop their confidence over time.

However, while our choices and actions can certainly influence our character traits, they are not the only factor. Our environment, upbringing, and experiences also play a significant role in shaping our personality. For example, a person who grows up in a supportive and nurturing environment may be more likely to develop traits such as empathy and kindness. On the other hand, someone who experiences trauma or neglect may be more likely to develop traits such as anxiety or aggression.

Furthermore, even our own choices can be influenced by external factors. For example, a person may choose to become more outgoing because they want to make new friends, but this choice may be influenced by external factors such as social pressure or a desire to fit in. In this way, our choices are not always completely independent, and external influences can still shape our character traits.

In conclusion, while our choices and actions can certainly influence our character traits, they are not the only factor. Our environment, upbringing, and experiences also play a significant role in shaping our personality. Furthermore, even our own choices can be influenced by external factors. Therefore, I believe that our character traits are shaped by a combination of our own choices and external influences. By recognizing the role that external factors play in shaping our personality, we can better understand ourselves and work to develop the traits that we want to possess.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey there!  So, I was tasked with researching the advantages of taking online classes instead of attending physical classes in school. At first, I was like, ""Ugh, do I really have to?"" But then I realized that online classes are actually pretty cool! 😅

First of all, let's talk about how online classes are super convenient for students who don't enjoy coming to school. Like, who doesn't love sleeping in or binge-watching Netflix on a Friday morning? 😴 With online classes, you can do all that and still learn new stuff! You can take your classes from the comfort of your own home, or even while lounging in your pajamas. 😂 It's like having the best of both worlds!

Another awesome thing about online classes is that you can work at your own pace. I know some people who are super smart and can finish their work super fast, while others might need a bit more time. Online classes allow you to take breaks whenever you need to, and you can even pause the video if you need to grab a snack or something. 🍿🥤 It's like having your own personalized learning experience!

Oh, and let's not forget about snow days! ❄️ I mean, who doesn't love having an extra day off from school? But with online classes, you can still learn even on days when school is closed. It's like having the best of both worlds! 😃

Lastly, online classes give you the ability to finish work anytime you want. I know some people who are night owls and prefer to study late at night. With online classes, you can do that! You can even study during your lunch break or on the weekends. It's like having the freedom to learn whenever and wherever you want! 🌞

In conclusion, online classes are super convenient and flexible. They offer a lot of advantages for students who don't enjoy coming to school, want to work at their own pace, or want to finish work anytime. So, if you're someone who's been thinking about taking online classes, I say go for it! You won",1,llama2_chat,2

First of all, schools teach us stuff. Like, actual stuff that we need to know to survive in life. Like, math and science and stuff. And they don't just teach us the basics, they teach us how to think and solve problems too. So, like, we can be smart and stuff. And it's not just about academics, schools teach us social skills too. Like, how to be a good friend and how to work in a group.

And, like, schools provide opportunities for us to explore our interests. Like, if you're into music, you can join the band or choir. Or, if you're into art, you can take an art class. And, like, it's not just about the classes, schools have clubs and stuff too. So, you can find people who like the same things as you and hang out with them.

And, like, schools are a place where we can make friends. Like, real friends. Not just, you know, the people we sit next to in class. But, like, people who we can hang out with outside of school too.

"Being Against an Extended School Day

The current school schedule has been in place for many years, and while it may have served its purpose at one time, it is no longer effective for the modern student. With the increasing demands on students and the need for them to be well-rounded individuals, an extended school day is becoming more and more popular. However, there are several reasons why I believe that an extended school day is not the solution to the problems facing our education system.

Firstly, an extended school day can lead to unproductive and negative entities. Students who are forced to stay in school for longer hours may become tired, bored, and disengaged. This can lead to a decline in academic performance, as well as an increase in behavioral problems. Furthermore, an extended school day can put additional pressure on students to perform well academically, which can lead to stress and anxiety.

Secondly, an extended school day can create incompatibilities for both students and related individuals. For students, an extended school day can mean that they have to give up extracurricular activities or time for hobbies and interests. This can lead to a lack of well-roundedness and a lack of personal development. For parents and guardians, an extended school day can mean that they have to find alternative childcare arrangements, which can be expensive and inconvenient.

However, there are also possible benefits to an extended school day. For example, an extended school day can provide more time for students to receive additional academic support and tutoring. It can also provide more time for students to engage in extracurricular activities and develop their social skills.

Despite these potential benefits, an extended school day can also cause problems for both parents, guardians, and teachers. Parents and guardians may struggle to find affordable and convenient childcare arrangements, which can lead to stress and anxiety. Teachers may also struggle to keep up with the increased workload and may feel overwhelmed.

In conclusion, while an extended school day may seem like a solution to the problems facing our education system, it is not without its drawbacks. An extended school day can lead to unproductive and negative entities, create incompatibilities for both students and related individuals, and cause problems for parents, guardians, and teachers. While there are potential benefits to an extended school day, these benefits must be weighed",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Hey, I'm just an average 8th grade student, so bear with me! 😅

Thomas Jefferson once said, ""It is best to determine never to be idle."" At first, this quote might make you think that he's saying we should always be doing something. But, I think he's actually saying the opposite. Sometimes, it's okay to do nothing.

I know, I know, it sounds crazy. How can doing nothing be okay? But hear me out. When we're always doing something, we never really take the time to relax and recharge. We're always on the go, always busy, always stressed. And that can be really bad for our mental and physical health.

Like, think about it. When you're constantly doing something, you never get a chance to just sit back and enjoy the moment. You're always thinking about what you have to do next, what you have to accomplish, what you have to fix. It's like, how can you enjoy life when you're always running around like a crazy person?

But, when you take the time to do nothing, you can actually relax and recharge. You can let your mind wander, let your body relax, and just enjoy the moment. It's like, you're giving yourself permission to take a break from all the craziness and just be. And that's important.

And, let's be real, sometimes doing nothing is actually more productive than doing something. Like, think about it. When you're constantly doing something, you're not really thinking about how to improve things, you're just doing the same old thing over and over again. But, when you take the time to do nothing, you can actually think about how to make things better. You can come up with new ideas, new solutions, new ways of doing things.

So, in conclusion, I think it's okay to do nothing sometimes. In fact, I think it's important. Because, when we take the time to relax and recharge, we can actually be more productive and creative in the long run. And, who doesn't want to be more productive and creative? 😅

"As an average 8th-grade student, I have developed a talent for playing the guitar. I have been playing the guitar for about 5 years now, and it has become a passion for me. I have always been fascinated by music, and the guitar has allowed me to express my love for it in a creative way.

I first learned how to play the guitar from my older brother, who had been playing for a few years at the time. He taught me the basics, such as how to hold the guitar, how to read sheet music, and how to play some simple chords. From there, I began to experiment with different songs and styles of music, and I quickly became hooked.

Over the years, my talent for playing the guitar has developed significantly. I have practiced regularly, and I have taken lessons from a professional guitar teacher to help me improve my technique and learn new songs. I have also been influenced by other guitarists, both famous and local, and have tried to emulate their styles and techniques.

One of my biggest influences has been the legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix. I have always been amazed by his skill and creativity, and I have spent countless hours listening to his music and trying to learn his songs. I have also been influenced by other famous guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Slash.

In addition to these famous guitarists, I have also been influenced by local musicians in my community. I have attended local music festivals and concerts, and I have been inspired by the talent and creativity of the local musicians I have seen perform. I have also been fortunate enough to have some talented friends who also play the guitar, and I have learned a lot from them as well.

In conclusion, my talent for playing the guitar has developed significantly over the years, and I have been influenced by a variety of musicians, both famous and local. I have been fortunate enough to have a supportive family and community that has encouraged me to pursue my passion for music.

"As an 8th grade student, the idea of committing to a career may seem daunting and overwhelming. However, it is an important decision that can have a significant impact on one's future. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of committing to a career at a young age and provide evidence and examples to support my opinion.

On the one hand, committing to a career at a young age can have several advantages. Firstly, it allows individuals to focus their efforts and resources on their chosen field, which can lead to greater success and fulfillment. For example, if a student is passionate about becoming a doctor, they can begin taking courses and gaining experience in the medical field at an early age. This can give them a head start on their career and make it easier to achieve their goals.

Secondly, committing to a career can provide a sense of direction and purpose. It can give young people a clear idea of what they want to achieve in life and help them make informed decisions about their education and future opportunities. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may be unsure about their goals or struggling to find their passion.

On the other hand, committing to a career at a young age can also have several disadvantages. Firstly, it can limit one's options and opportunities. If a student commits to a career that they are not truly passionate about, they may miss out on other opportunities and experiences that could have a positive impact on their personal and professional growth.

Secondly, committing to a career at a young age can put pressure on individuals to achieve their goals quickly and without fully understanding the demands and challenges of their chosen field. This can lead to burnout and disillusionment, particularly if the reality of their career does not live up to their expectations.

In conclusion, the decision to commit to a career at a young age is a complex and nuanced one. While it can have several advantages, such as providing focus and direction, it can also have several disadvantages, such as limiting options and putting pressure on individuals to achieve their goals quickly. Ultimately, the decision to commit to a career should be based on careful consideration of one's passions, goals, and values, as well as an understanding of the demands and challenges of their chosen field.

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an argumentative essay as an 8th grade student:

Extending school hours: Yay or Nay?

School hours, those magical times of the day where we get to learn stuff and hang out with our friends. But, have you ever thought about how long those hours actually are? Like, they're not that long. I mean, we get out of school around 3 or 3:30, and then we have to do homework and stuff until like, 5 or 6. It's just not enough time! That's why I think we should extend school hours.

Okay, so here are some reasons why. First of all, we could get more done. Like, think about it. If we had more time in school, we could learn more stuff. And not just like, basic stuff, but like, advanced stuff too. Like, we could learn about college and stuff, or how to do taxes and stuff. That would be so cool! And we could also do more projects and stuff, like science experiments and presentations. That would be fun!

Another reason why we should extend school hours is because it would help us get ready for college. Like, college is a lot longer than high school, and if we don't get used to being in school for longer periods of time, it's gonna be really hard when we get there. Plus, it would be nice to have more time to hang out with our friends and stuff. We could have study groups and stuff, and it would just be more fun.

But, there are also some reasons why we shouldn't extend school hours. Like, it would be really hard for working parents to pick us up from school. They have to work during the day, so it would be really hard for them to come get us if we stayed later. And also, some kids might not be able to stay later because of their schedules. Like, they might have other activities or sports or something, and it would be really hard for them to fit in more school time.

So, overall, I think we should extend school hours. It would be really cool to learn more stuff and have more time to hang out with our friends. But, we have to think about the working parents and the kids with other",1,llama2_chat,1
"Working in a group is a common practice in many aspects of life, from school to work. While some may argue that working alone is more effective, the benefits of working in a group are numerous and varied. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of working in a group, both academically and socially. I will provide examples of how working in groups can be beneficial in class and in life. I will also analyze the potential challenges and provide solutions on how to overcome them.

One of the most significant benefits of working in a group is the opportunity for collaboration. When working in a group, individuals can share their ideas and work together to create a solution. This can lead to more creative and innovative ideas than working alone. For example, in class, working in a group can lead to more comprehensive and well-rounded projects. When students work together, they can combine their strengths and complement each other's weaknesses. This can lead to a more successful project.

Another benefit of working in a group is the opportunity for socialization. When working in a group, individuals can learn from and interact with people from different backgrounds. This can lead to new friendships and a broader perspective on the world. For example, in a group project at work, individuals from different departments can collaborate and learn from each other. This can lead to better communication and understanding between departments, which can ultimately benefit the company.

However, working in a group can also present challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the potential for conflict. When working in a group, individuals may have different opinions or ideas about how to approach a problem. This can lead to disagreements and tension within the group. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to establish clear communication and set ground rules for group discussions. This can help to ensure that everyone's voice is heard and that conflicts are resolved in a respectful and productive manner.

Another challenge of working in a group is the potential for unequal contributions. Some individuals may take on more responsibility or contribute more than others, leading to feelings of frustration and resentment. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each member of the group. This can help to ensure that everyone is contributing to the group's success and that no one feels left behind.

In conclusion, working in a group has numerous benefits, both academically and socially. The",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Hey there! 

So, I guess I'm gonna write about working in groups and alone.  It's like, totally important to know the pros and cons of both, right? 

Okay, so working in a group is like, you know, when you and your friends are like, ""Hey, let's do this project together!"" And you're all like, ""Yeah, that's a great idea!"" And then you're like, ""Whoa, how are we gonna do this?!""  But, like, it's not all bad. You can like, brainstorm together and come up with some awesome ideas. And it's like, way more fun than working alone, 'cause you got your friends to hang out with. 

But, like, working alone has its pros too.  You can like, focus better and get stuff done way faster.  'Cause, you know, when you're working with others, sometimes people can be, like, distracting.  And you gotta make sure everyone's on the same page, which can be, like, really time-consuming.  But, when you're alone, you can just, like, do your own thing and not have to worry about anyone else. 

So, like, there are these scenarios where working in a group is way better than working alone.  Like, when you're doing a group project for school, it's way easier to work with your friends 'cause you can, like, divide the work and stuff.  And it's way more fun too!  But, like, there are also times when working alone is better.  Like, when you're trying to come up with a new idea for a business or something, it's way better to work alone so you can, like, focus and think without anyone distracting you. 

And, like, the communication part of working in a group is, like, totally important.  You got",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey, I'm just an 8th grader, so bear with me! 😅

Winston Churchill's quote, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" is super deep and inspirational. It means that even when we fail at something, we shouldn't give up. We should keep trying and never lose our excitement for what we're doing.

Churchill himself embodied this quote throughout his life. He failed at school, getting kicked out of the Navy, and even losing elections before becoming one of the most successful leaders in British history. But he never lost his enthusiasm! He kept going, learning from his mistakes, and eventually became Prime Minister during World War II.

One example of Churchill's perseverance is when he was rejected from the Navy. Instead of getting discouraged, he used it as an opportunity to write his first book, ""The Celebrity."" He didn't let failure hold him back – he used it to fuel his passion for writing.

Another example is when he lost the election in 1945. Most people would've given up, but Churchill didn't. He kept speaking out against the Nazis and rallying his country, even though they didn't elect him. His enthusiasm never wavered, and he eventually became Prime Minister in 1940, when Britain needed him most.

Churchill's quote is inspirational because it shows us that failure isn't the end of the world. It's okay to fail, and it's important to keep trying. If Churchill, one of the most successful leaders in history, could go from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm, then we can too!

In conclusion, Churchill's quote is super deep and inspirational. It shows us that failure isn't the end, and that we should never lose our enthusiasm for what we're doing. Churchill embodied this quote throughout his life, and we can learn from his perseverance and passion. So, the next time you fail, don't give up – keep going and never lose your enthusiasm! 💪",1,llama2_chat,2
"Technology has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, impacting us both positively and negatively. On the one hand, the increased use of technology has diminished the amount of face-to-face contact, leading to heightened levels of isolation and loneliness among many people. On the other hand, technology has allowed us to accomplish tasks more efficiently and widened our access to information and resources. 

One area in which technology is seen as especially beneficial is in helping older people to manage their medical needs. Technology has enabled advancements that allow seniors to monitor their health and access medical assistance remotely while also connecting them to family members or caregivers. 

Students also reap the rewards of technology, as increased access to computers and the internet means they can access information and resources more easily than ever before. This also allows them to communicate with their peers and teachers more effectively than in the past. 

Lastly, prolonged use of technology does come with some drawbacks. Overuse of electronics can be damaging to a person's physical and mental health, leading to eyestrain, headaches, and poor posture. Additionally, too much screen time can have a detrimental effect on social and emotional development. 

In conclusion, while technology has both positive and negative impacts on our lives, it is ultimately up to us to limit the less beneficial aspects of it and take advantage of the useful ones.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As an 8th grader, I have witnessed the rapid growth of technology and its impact on people's lives. One of the most significant advantages of technology is the rise of online education. My brother, for instance, was able to take online courses during his senior year of high school, which helped him to graduate early and start college earlier than his peers. This flexibility allowed him to take classes that interested him the most, without having to worry about the rigid schedule of a traditional classroom.

Another area where technology has had a significant impact is online jobs. Becoming a YouTuber, for example, has become a popular career path for many young people. With the rise of social media, it has become easier for people to showcase their talents and connect with a global audience. While this can be a lucrative career path, there are also risks involved, such as the constant need to create content and the pressure to maintain a certain image.

In addition to these career paths, technology has also changed the way people shop. With the rise of e-commerce, companies like Amazon have made it easier for people to order goods from the comfort of their own homes. This has made shopping more convenient, but it has also led to concerns about privacy and security.

In conclusion, technology has had a profound impact on people's lives, from education to employment to shopping. While there are many advantages to these changes, there are also risks and challenges that must be addressed. As technology continues to evolve, it is important for individuals and society as a whole to be aware of these impacts and to make informed decisions about how to use technology in a responsible and ethical manner.",1,llama2_chat,0

"One of the greatest benefits of learning from the experiences of others is that it can provide a shortcut to success. By examining the successes and struggles of those that came before us, we can gain invaluable insight into how to approach and overcome the common challenges of success. This kind of wisdom can be shared and can promote personal growth and help us achieve our goals.

Shared experiences can also create connections and solidarity. When we open up to other people about our personal successes and struggles, it can help us form meaningful relationships, which can be a source of support and inspiration.

However, although learning from others can help greatly, ultimate success still largely depends on hard work and dedication. Seeing the success of someone else may motivate us to strive for our own, but to actually achieve our goals, it is necessary to put in the necessary effort. Thus, it is important to recognize the importance of our own hard work and never give up.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have observed that most students do not like the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. There are several reasons why this is the case, and these reasons have a significant impact on the performance of students in school. In this essay, I will analyze these reasons and suggest solutions that would make the school cafeteria more appetizing and appealing to students while taking into account the concerns of parents.

One of the primary reasons why students do not like the school lunch is because of the lack of variety in the menu. The same options are served day after day, which can become monotonous and unappetizing. This lack of variety can lead to students skipping meals or eating unhealthy snacks, which can negatively impact their academic performance. To address this issue, the school could introduce a rotating menu that includes a variety of options, such as salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes. This would give students more options to choose from and prevent them from getting bored with the same old menu.

Another reason why students do not like the school lunch is because of the quality of the food. Many students have reported that the food served in the cafeteria is often cold, dry, and lacks flavor. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as inadequate cooking equipment, overcrowding, and a lack of staff training. To address this issue, the school could invest in better cooking equipment, hire more staff to prepare the food, and provide training to ensure that the food is cooked to the appropriate temperature and served promptly.

Lastly, students do not like the school lunch because of the cost. Many students come from low-income families and cannot afford to pay for additional meals or snacks. This can lead to students going hungry or eating unhealthy foods, which can negatively impact their academic performance. To address this issue, the school could offer free or reduced-price meals to students from low-income families. Additionally, the school could partner with local businesses to provide discounts or coupons for students to use at the cafeteria.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why most students do not like the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. These reasons include a lack of variety in the menu, the quality of the food, and the cost. To address these issues, the school could",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Attending classes at school provides unique advantages not available through online classes. For example, attending school provides students with face-to-face communication with their peers and instructors. Additionally, a physical campus allows for collaboration between students in groups which can be difficult to replicate online. 

On the other hand, taking classes online has its own advantages. It allows students to learn from any location, providing a greater degree of flexibility than attending classes in person. Moreover, online classes might be more accessible in terms of price and having higher technology-related requirements in order for the student to attend their classes. 

If everyone took classes online, schools would face the challenge of fewer students attending. This could lead to fewer resources available for students, a possibly reduced class selection, and the disruption of field trips and extracurriculars due to lack of participation. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased school spirit and a feeling of disconnect from the school community overall.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that cell phone use should be allowed in the classroom. While some argue that cell phones are a distraction and can negatively affect students' academic performance, I believe that the benefits of allowing cell phones in the classroom far outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Firstly, cell phones are a valuable tool for communication and collaboration. In today's digital age, students need to be able to communicate with their peers and teachers effectively, both inside and outside of the classroom. Allowing cell phones in the classroom provides students with a way to easily connect with their classmates and teachers, which can enhance their learning experience.

Additionally, cell phones are a great way for students to access information and resources. With the internet at their fingertips, students can quickly look up information, research topics, and collaborate with their classmates on projects. This can help students to better understand the material and complete their assignments more efficiently.

Furthermore, cell phones can be used as a tool for self-reflection and self-improvement. Students can use their cell phones to track their progress, set goals, and reflect on their performance. This can help students to take ownership of their learning and improve their academic outcomes.

In conclusion, I believe that allowing cell phone use in the classroom is the most reasonable approach. While some argue that cell phones are a distraction and can negatively affect students' academic performance, I believe that the benefits of allowing cell phones in the classroom far outweigh the potential drawbacks. By providing students with a valuable tool for communication, collaboration, and self-reflection, we can help them to become more engaged and successful learners.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

So, I think that students with a C average should totally be able to get extra help and participate in activities, with everyone's permission, of course!  It just makes sense, you know?

First of all, let's talk about why students with a C average might need extra help. Maybe they're struggling with a particular subject, or maybe they're just not as interested in school as other people. Whatever the reason, they deserve a chance to catch up and get better!  And who knows, maybe they'll even discover a new passion or talent! 

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But won't this give them an unfair advantage?""  And I get that, but I think it's important to remember that everyone learns differently and at their own pace.  Some people might be super smart and get A's easily, but that doesn't mean they don't need help sometimes too! 

And let's not forget about the benefits of participating in activities!  It's a great way for students to learn new skills, make friends, and just have fun!  Plus, it can help them develop important life skills like teamwork, communication, and time management.  And who doesn't want to be a well-rounded person? 

Of course, I get that there are some concerns about how this might affect the class dynamic and the workload of teachers.  But I think that with the right support and resources, it can totally work out!  And hey, maybe it'll even inspire other students to work harder and do better in school!

"Winston Churchill once famously said ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement emphasizes the importance of failure and perseverance in the pursuit of success. When faced with a challenging situation, an individual's enthusiasm and optimism play a major role in their likelihood of success. If an individual approaches a situation with enthusiasm, they are more likely to invest more effort, be more innovative, and stay motivated when difficulties arise. For example, during my university studies, I began my first year with enthusiasm and a strong desire to succeed. This enthusiasm motivated me to stay dedicated to my studies and inspired me to tackle any challenge I faced. Ultimately, my enthusiasm and perseverance enabled me to achieve my goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"First impressions are difficult to shake, but not impossible. Everyone has had experiences where their first impression of someone has changed over time. For instance, when I first met my manager at work, I was unsure of how she would react to my ideas. She seemed distant and I was hesitant to voice my thoughts. Over time, however, I got to know her better and she opened up to me. I eventually learnt that her distant demeanor was only her way of being professional. Now, I respect her as someone who values hard work.

Another example of how my initial impression of someone had changed was when I met my best friend. At first, I thought she was too judgemental and was wary of making friends with her. However, as I got to know her better, I began to appreciate her for her honest and direct personality. Now, she is one of my closest friends.

"Sure, I'll give it a shot! Here's my essay:

""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" This quote by Anonymous really resonates with me because I've experienced it firsthand. When I was in 7th grade, I was really good at math, but I never pushed myself to try harder problems. I was comfortable with what I knew, but I didn't realize that by not challenging myself, I was limiting my potential.

One day, my teacher assigned a really hard math problem that I had no idea how to solve. At first, I felt frustrated and discouraged, but then I decided to give it a try. It took me a while, but I finally figured it out! It was so cool to see that I was capable of solving something that was way beyond what I thought I could do.

Since then, I've made it a point to push myself in all my subjects. I've taken on more challenging projects in science and history, and I've even joined the debate team. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. When I'm struggling to understand a concept or prepare for a debate, I think back to that hard math problem and remember that I'm capable of growing and learning.

Attempting to do something new and challenging can help foster growth in so many ways. For one thing, it helps us develop resilience and perseverance. When we face obstacles and setbacks, we learn to push through them and keep going. This is an important skill to have in life, because there will always be challenges that we can't avoid. By practicing resilience, we can build up our mental toughness and become better equipped to handle whatever comes our way.

Another way that attempting new things can help us grow is by broadening our horizons. When we try something new, we open ourselves up to new experiences and perspectives. We learn to see things from different angles and to consider different points of view. This can help us become more empathetic and understanding, which is essential in today's diverse and interconnected world.

"Technology has become an inextricable part of modern life, and its implications on people's lives have been both positive and negative. On one hand, technology has enabled us to connect with people from all around the world, share our thoughts, learn new skills, acquire new knowledge, and engage in a variety of activities that were once considered impossible. On the other hand, this heavy reliance on technology can make us forget how to truly enjoy life. For example, many people feel inadequate because of the curated version of reality presented on social media and comparison with others’ lifestyles or accomplishments, making them feel disconnected from their own lives, potentially leading to depression and other forms of mental illness. 

We must take action to ensure that technology is used in a productive, healthy way. It is important to recognize that technology can have an adverse effect on our physical and mental health and make sure to take regular breaks from electronic devices in order to relax our brains. We should also make conscious efforts to understand the true nature of reality and be mindful of our time spent on technology to ensure that we live more authentic, balanced lives.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

So, let's say there are two students, Sarah and John. Sarah starts working on a project from the very beginning of summer vacation, like, right after school gets out. She's all like, ""Gotta get this done so I can impress my teacher!"" And John, on the other hand, is all like, ""Eh, I'll just chill and relax for now. I'll start working on it towards the end of summer.""  Like, duh, John.

Like, it's pretty cool how something as simple as smiling at someone or holding the door open for them can make their day better. It's like, it doesn't take much effort, but it can make a big difference.

So, when you show kindness to someone, it can actually improve their attitude. Like, if someone's having a bad day, and you're nice to them, it can make them feel better. It's like, it's a pick-me-up. And it's not just for the person who's having a bad day, it's also for the person showing kindness. It can make them feel good too, like they're making a difference.

And it's not just about making someone's day better, it can also help someone become a better person. Like, if you're always showing kindness to someone, it can teach them to be kind too. It's like, it's a good habit to get into. And it's not just about the person you're showing kindness to, it's also about you. It can make you feel good, like you're doing something good for someone else.

And let's not forget about people who are going through hard times. Like, if someone's lost their job or something, and you're nice to them, it can make them feel better. It's like, it's a reminder that there are still good people in the world. And it's not just about making them feel better, it can also help them get through tough times.

So, performing small acts of kindness can benefit both the person being shown kindness and the person showing kindness. It's like, it's a win-win situation. And it's not just about big things, it's about the little things too. Like, holding the door open for someone or letting someone cut in front of you in line.

"First impressions are a crucial aspect of human interaction. They are the initial thoughts and feelings we have about someone or something, and they can greatly influence our future interactions with that person or thing. However, the question arises whether first impressions are truly impossible to change. In my opinion, first impressions can be changed over time, and I will provide two examples of how my first impression of someone has changed over time.

My first example is my impression of my English teacher in high school. When I first met her, I thought she was strict and unapproachable. She always seemed to be in a bad mood, and she would give harsh feedback on our assignments. I believed that she was not someone I could connect with, and I was hesitant to approach her for help or advice. However, as time went on, I began to see a different side of her. I realized that she was passionate about teaching, and she genuinely cared about her students' success. She would often take the time to listen to our concerns and offer words of encouragement. I also noticed that she was not as strict as I had initially thought. She would give us more freedom to express our opinions and ideas in class, and she would often praise our efforts and accomplishments. Through these experiences, my first impression of my English teacher has changed completely. I now view her as a supportive and caring mentor, and I am grateful for the positive impact she has had on my life.

My second example is my impression of my neighbor. When I first moved into my house, I did not know my neighbor very well. I would occasionally see them outside or hear them playing music, but we never really spoke. I assumed that they were a reclusive and antisocial person, and I did not want to intrude on their privacy. However, as time went on, I began to see a different side of them. I would notice that they would often be outside playing with their dog, and they would wave and smile at me as I passed by. I also heard them laughing and joking with their friends, and I realized that they were not as reserved as I had initially thought. Through these experiences, my first impression of my neighbor has changed completely. I now view them as a friendly and outgoing person, and I enjoy striking up conversations with them whenever I see them.

Okay, so for this essay, I had to research the benefits and disadvantages of students participating in extracurricular activities. Like, I know some people think it's super important, but others think it's a waste of time. So, I'm gonna give you my thoughts on it. 🤔

First off, let's talk about the benefits of extracurricular activities. I think they're really cool because they help you learn new things and make new friends. Like, if you're into sports, you can join a team and learn how to play a new game. Or, if you're into music, you can join a band and learn how to play an instrument. It's like, you get to try new things and see what you're good at! 🎸

Another benefit is that it looks good on college apps. Like, if you have a bunch of cool extracurricular activities, it shows that you're a well-rounded person. It's like, you're not just some nerd who only cares about schoolwork. You're also, like, a cool person who does cool things! 📚

Now, let's talk about the disadvantages. One of them is that it can be really time-consuming. Like, if you're in a bunch of extracurricular activities, you might not have enough time to study for tests or hang out with your friends. It's like, you gotta choose between doing things you like and doing things you have to do. And that can be hard! 🕒

Another disadvantage is that it can be really stressful. Like, if you're in a lot of activities, you might feel like you're constantly running around and doing things. It's like, you might not have enough time to relax and chill out. And that can be really bad for your mental health! 🤯

To counteract this, it is important to take a step back and consider these snap judgments in a larger context.

Being passionate and driven to achieve the best results can help drive innovation and lead to the production of work which is above and beyond what was expected. However, there are some occasions where it is not likely that these higher standards will be met and enthusiasm alone cannot carry the task to a successful conclusion.

Enthusiasm without a practical or realistic plan for success means that the initial excitement or energy is not likely to be sustained throughout the project. Having a plan in place to make sure that enthusiasm does not falter can be the difference between success and failure.

In summary, while enthusiasm can be useful and is often seen as a key factor in achieving success, it is not guaranteed to lead to success and should be combined with a practical plan in order to reach the desired outcome.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"It is important for people to take their own decisions in life, rather than relying on the opinions of others. People with self-reliance are able to think and act for themselves, and are secure in the knowledge that whatever choices they make are guided by their own intuition. They have the courage to pursue their own vision and the strength of character to make decisions, even if those decisions are unpopular. 

Unfortunately, many people are scared of taking their own decisions for fear of failure and embarrassment. They worry that if they make the wrong choice, they will be judged negatively by other people. However, it is important to remember that making mistakes is a natural part of life and can have many positive outcomes. By having the courage to take their own decisions, people can learn valuable lessons and gain more self-confidence. 

In conclusion, it is essential for people to take their own decisions in life rather than relying solely on the opinions of others. By letting go of the fear of making mistakes and having the courage to trust their intuition, people can learn and grow from their own decisions.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"It is easy to think that in order to be successful in life, we must put our own individual preferences and values to the side in order to focus solely on goal achievement. However, it is important to remember that in order to be truly successful, it is essential to stay true to ourselves. It is only when we embrace our unique qualities and abilities that we can make the most out of our lives, achieve our goals, and enjoy true satisfaction in life. 

One of the most important things to keep in mind is that success looks different for everyone. What works for one person may not work for another, so it’s important to keep an open mind and recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all formula for success. We must find our own way to achieve our goals while being true to ourselves. This means being honest about who we are, our goals, our passions, and our values. Only then can we truly commit to our goals and make meaningful progress. 

Another key to success is having a clear and achievable plan. It is essential to set realistic targets and take action to reach them. We should also be mindful of our strengths and weaknesses, as such knowledge can help shape our plans. When approaching our plans, it is also important to stay flexible and allow ourselves to adjust our goals as needed. Through this method of genuine effort and hard work, we can create a path that is both meaningful and true to ourselves. 

Ultimately, the key to achieving success while staying true to who we are lies in the deliberate pursuit of our goals and the courage to stay true to what matters to us. By embracing our own definition of success and having the strength to pursue it, we can find true success in life and create a future that is both meaningful and rewarding.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Productivity versus Idleness: A Comparative Analysis

Introduction

Productivity and idleness are two contrasting ways of life that can have significant impacts on a person's life and career opportunities. While productivity is often associated with success and recognition, idleness can lead to a lack of fulfillment and missed opportunities. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of both productivity and idleness, examine examples of successful people who have worked hard to gain recognition, and analyze the effects of idleness on a person's life and career opportunities.

Benefits of Productivity

Productivity is the state of being highly efficient and productive in one's work. It is often associated with success and recognition, as it allows individuals to accomplish more in less time. Productivity can lead to increased job satisfaction, higher salaries, and better career opportunities. For example, individuals who are productive and efficient in their work are often seen as valuable assets to their employers and are more likely to be promoted or given additional responsibilities.

Drawbacks of Idleness

Idleness, on the other hand, is the state of being unproductive and inactive. It can lead to a lack of fulfillment and missed opportunities. Idleness can also have negative impacts on a person's mental and physical health. For example, individuals who spend too much time sitting and not engaging in physical activity are at an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health issues. Additionally, idleness can lead to feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction, which can negatively impact a person's overall well-being.

Examples of Successful People

There are many successful people who have worked hard to gain recognition. For example, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful media personalities of all time, rose from a poverty-stricken childhood to become a household name. Her success was due in large part to her hard work, determination, and productivity. Similarly, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has achieved incredible success through his hard work and dedication to his projects. Both Winfrey and Musk are examples of individuals who have worked hard to achieve success and recognition.

Effects of Idleness

Idleness can have significant negative effects on a person's life and career opportunities.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Essay: The Importance of Imagination vs. Knowledge

Imagination and knowledge are two concepts that are often seen as opposites, but they are actually complementary and essential for our growth and development. While knowledge provides us with facts and information, imagination allows us to think creatively and envision new possibilities. In this essay, I will argue that imagination is just as important as knowledge, and that the two are interconnected.

On one hand, knowledge is crucial for understanding the world around us. It helps us learn new things, solve problems, and make informed decisions. Without knowledge, we would not be able to appreciate the beauty of science, history, or literature. Knowledge gives us a foundation to build upon and helps us understand the complexities of life. For example, knowing about different cultures and traditions helps us appreciate their unique perspectives and values.

On the other hand, imagination is what sets us apart from other living beings. It allows us to dream, to create, and to innovate. Imagination is what enables us to envision a better future, to imagine new possibilities, and to bring our ideas to life. Without imagination, we would not have art, music, or literature. Imagination is what makes life interesting and exciting. For instance, imagine if Leonardo da Vinci had not imagined the helicopter, we would not have this amazing invention today.

However, imagination and knowledge are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are interconnected and complement each other. Knowledge provides us with the foundation to imagine new possibilities, and imagination inspires us to seek out new knowledge. For example, understanding the principles of physics allows us to imagine new machines and technologies. Imagination can also help us to find new solutions to problems, and to apply knowledge in creative ways.

In conclusion, imagination and knowledge are both important, but they serve different purposes. While knowledge provides us with facts and information, imagination inspires us to think creatively and to envision new possibilities. The two are interconnected, and they are essential for our growth and development. So, let us embrace both imagination and knowledge, and use them to create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.",1,llama2_chat,1
"Though there is no one activity that can provide every benefit, the outdoors offer a variety of activities that can be tailored to suit any individual's lifestyle and health goals. Activities such as biking, running, swimming, and hiking have numerous benefits that range from lower stress levels to providing a full-body workout. Even something as simple as taking a walk or going for a picnic can help improve mental health and foster a sense of connection with nature. 

Additionally, spending time outdoors provides opportunities to connect with family, friends, and potential new acquaintances. Setting a plan for people to get fit while enjoying the outdoors doesn't have to be limited to exercise. Consider also creating opportunities to help those in need, such as donating old outdoor gear or participating in a park clean-up. Being outdoors doesn't have to be boring.

So, technology...  It's like, everywhere.  I mean, it's cool and all, but it's also kinda...  You know what I mean? 

Okay, so let's talk good effects first.  Like, technology has made life so much easier, you know? We can communicate with people all over the world in seconds!  And we can learn stuff too, with like, online courses and stuff.  It's like, who needs books when you can just watch a video? 

But,  there are also some bad effects.  Like, people are so addicted to their screens nowadays.  I mean, I'm guilty of it too, but it's like, we're all just staring at our phones all day long.  And it's not just us, it's like, our parents and teachers too.  It's like, we're all forgetting how to interact with each other face-to-face. 

And then there's cyberbullying.  Like, it's so bad nowadays.  People can be so mean online, and it can really affect someone's self-esteem.  And it's not just kids, adults can be mean too.  It's like, we need to be more kind to each other online, you know? 

So,  I think we need to find a balance between technology and face-to-face interaction.  Like, we can use technology to learn and communicate, but we also need to make time for real-life interactions.  It's like, we don't want to lose ourselves in a world of screens, you know?

"Hey, so for this essay, I had to think about whether we accomplish more when we're always doing something or if inactivity also serves a purpose. Like, I know some people who are always on the go and always have a ton of stuff going on, but then there are others who are more laid back and don't do much. So, I was like, what's the deal?

So, I looked into it and found out that Thomas Jefferson, one of our founding fathers, had some pretty cool thoughts on the matter. He believed that inactivity can be just as important as activity, because sometimes taking a break and relaxing can be really helpful. Like, think about it, if you're always going, going, going, you can get burned out and stuff. But if you take some time to chill, you can come back to things with fresh eyes and be more productive. Makes sense, right?

But, on the other hand, inactivity can also have some pretty bad consequences. Like, if you're not doing anything, you're not learning new things or growing as a person. And that can be bad for your brain and your overall well-being. So, it's important to find a balance, you know?

So, how do we motivate ourselves to do more? Well, one thing I've found is that setting goals is super important. Like, if you have something specific you want to achieve, you'll be more motivated to work towards it. And it doesn't have to be something huge, it can be something small like reading a book or learning a new skill. Just having something to work towards can make you feel more accomplished.

Another thing that's important is choosing which activities to take on. Like, if you're always saying yes to everything, you can get overwhelmed and stuff. So, it's good to be picky and only take on things that are really important to you. That way, you can focus your energy on what matters most.

In conclusion, I think it's important to find a balance between activity and inactivity. Both are important in their own ways, and it's all about finding what works for you. So, don't be afraid to take a break and relax, but also don't be",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey there!  So, I've been thinking about my future career and I'm really interested in both styling and painting landscapes. I know, I know, they're like totally different things, but bear with me here. 

First off, let's talk about stylists. They're like, super important for making people look good and feeling confident. I mean, who doesn't love getting their hair done or their makeup done for a special occasion? It's like, a total mood booster. And I'm pretty good at doing hair and makeup myself, so I figure I could be pretty good at it too!  Plus, I've heard stylists can make like, a ton of money. I mean, I'm not sure how much, but it's gotta be a pretty good amount, right? 

But, on the other hand, I'm also really into painting landscapes. I know, it's not exactly the same as styling, but I love being creative and making things look pretty.  I mean, there's just something so peaceful about painting a beautiful landscape, you know? It's like, you can escape into your own little world and just let your creativity flow. Plus, I've heard it can be really relaxing and therapeutic too. 

So, I'm trying to decide which one is better suited to my interests and skill set. Like, I know I'm pretty good at drawing and stuff, but I'm not sure if I could make a living off of it. I mean, I've heard it's really competitive and there's not always a lot of work. But, on the other hand, styling is like, super popular and there's always a demand for it.

"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the benefits of working in a team:

Working in a team is way better than working alone. Like, duh. When you're working alone, you can only come up with so many ideas before you start to get bored or stuck. But when you're working with other people, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with way more creative and innovative solutions. It's like, you can see the potential for growth and collaboration, you know?

For one thing, working in a team means you can divide tasks and responsibilities. So instead of having to do everything yourself, you can focus on what you're good at and let others handle the stuff they're good at. It's like, you can be a specialist in your own way, but still be part of a bigger picture. And that's way more efficient than trying to do everything yourself. Plus, it's less work for everyone!

Another thing is, working in a team can lead to better communication. When you're working with other people, you have to listen to their ideas and opinions, and they have to listen to yours. It's like, you're all in this together, you know? And that means you can come up with solutions that are way better than anything one person could come up with on their own. It's like, you can see the potential for growth and collaboration, you know?

And let's not forget about the moral support. When you're working alone, it can be really tough to stay motivated and keep going. But when you're working with a team, you can encourage and support each other, and that can make a huge difference. It's like, you can see the potential for growth and collaboration, you know?

So, in conclusion, working in a team is way better than working alone. It's like, you can see the potential for growth and collaboration, you know? You can come up with better ideas, divide tasks and responsibilities, and communicate better. And let's not forget about the moral support. So, next time you're working on a project, try working with a team instead of going it alone. Trust me, it'll be way better.",1,llama2_chat,0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Extracurricular Activities: A Necessary Requirement?

As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool that our school requires us to participate in an extracurricular activity. I know some people might think it's a hassle, but I think it's actually really beneficial.

First of all, it's a great way to meet new people. I joined the robotics club this year, and I've made some really cool friends who are into the same things as me. We're like a little team, and we work together to build and program our robot for competitions. It's a lot of fun, and I never would have met these people if I hadn't joined the club.

Another good thing about extracurricular activities is that they help you learn new skills. Like, I never would have learned how to program a robot if I hadn't joined the robotics club. It's a really useful skill to have, and it's something that I can put on my college application. Plus, it's just really cool to be able to say that I can program a robot!

I also think that extracurricular activities are good for your brain. When you're doing something you're interested in, it's easier to focus and learn. Plus, it's a way to take a break from school work and have some fun. It's like, you get to do something you love, and it's not even work!

Some people might say that requiring extracurricular activities is too much, but I think it's actually a good way to keep kids engaged. Like, if we didn't have to do anything outside of school, some kids might get bored and start acting out in class. But with extracurricular activities, they have something else to focus on and look forward to.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of going beyond conformity to reach success and keep the people we love in our lives:

Going Beyond Conformity to Reach Success and Keep the People We Love in Our Lives

As an 8th grader, I've learned that conformity can be a major obstacle in achieving success and keeping the people we love in our lives. Conformity is when we follow the crowd and do what everyone else is doing, without questioning or thinking for ourselves. While it may seem easier to go with the flow, it can actually hold us back from reaching our full potential and forming meaningful connections with others.

For example, imagine you're in a group project with your classmates. Everyone seems to be contributing their ideas and working together, but you're hesitant to share your own thoughts because you don't want to rock the boat. You end up doing the bare minimum and not really adding anything valuable to the project. As a result, your grade is lower than it could be, and you miss out on the opportunity to learn and grow.

On the other hand, when we go beyond conformity and embrace our individuality, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and experiences. For instance, if you're passionate about a particular subject, don't be afraid to share your ideas and take the lead on the project. Not only will you learn more and grow as a person, but you'll also inspire others to do the same.

Another way that going beyond conformity can help us keep the people we love in our lives is by showing them that we're confident and true to ourselves. When we're authentic and unafraid to be ourselves, we attract like-minded people who appreciate us for who we are. These are the people who will be there for us through thick and thin, and who will help us reach our full potential.

In conclusion, conformity may seem like an easy way to fit in and avoid conflict, but it can ultimately hold us back from achieving success and forming meaningful connections with others. By embracing our individuality and being true to ourselves, we can go beyond conformity and reach our full potential, both in school and in life. So,",1,llama2_chat,1
"After research into the subject, it has become clear that requiring students to take classes such as art, music, or drama can have multiple drawbacks. Firstly, students may feel unmotivated or uninspired by the subject matter, leading them to skip classes, resulting in lower overall attendance and grades. Similarly, when a student is required to take a class they are not passionate about, their enthusiasm decreases and they become less interested in learning in general. This decreased interest in learning can affect a student's motivation levels in all classes. Therefore, when mandating classes such as art, music, or drama for all students, their overall grades, attendance, and motivation levels can suffer.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having older students work with younger students has numerous benefits for both parties. Not only does it provide positive experiences for the younger children, but it also offers advantages for the older students. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of intergenerational learning and provide examples and evidence to illustrate my points.

One of the most significant benefits of having older students work with younger students is the positive experiences that the younger children can have. When older students work with younger students, they can provide guidance, support, and role models. For example, in a classroom setting, an older student can help a younger student with their homework or study for a test. They can also provide advice on how to navigate the social landscape of school and offer words of encouragement when the younger student is struggling.

Additionally, older students can provide a sense of belonging and community for younger students. When younger students work with older students, they can form meaningful connections and friendships. These connections can provide emotional support and a sense of belonging, which can be especially important for younger students who may be new to the school or struggling to make friends.

Another benefit of having older students work with younger students is the advantages that the older students can experience. When older students work with younger students, they can develop important leadership and communication skills. For example, they can take on the role of a mentor or coach, providing guidance and support to younger students. This can help them develop their ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively with others.

Additionally, older students can benefit from the positive experiences that they can provide for younger students. When older students work with younger students, they can experience a sense of purpose and fulfillment. They can see the impact that their actions have on the younger students and feel a sense of pride in knowing that they have helped someone else.

In conclusion, I believe that having older students work with younger students has numerous benefits for both parties. The positive experiences that younger students can have, such as guidance, support, and role models, can help them succeed academically and socially. Additionally, the benefits that older students can experience, such as developing important leadership and communication skills and feeling a sense of purpose, can help them grow and develop as individuals. Therefore, I believe that intergenerational learning should be encouraged and supported in schools and communities.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Moral values and social classes play an integral role in the formation of a person's character. As an individual's life progresses, these characteristics take on different meanings and meanings, ultimately contributing to personal growth, identity, and decisions. 

Morals are the values that we have developed throughout our lives and that guide us in decision making. They shape our conscience and give us direction in moments of doubt or struggle. In addition, they inform us of our beliefs, attitudes, and preferences. For example, a moral principle such as not stealing can discourage a person from taking shortcuts or engaging in other criminal activities. In essence, morals are the compass of our lives which leads us in making good character decisions.

Class also plays a role in how a person's character is formed. People from different social classes may have different sets of morals and values due to their different upbringings and backgrounds. For example, someone who grew up in a wealthy family may have a different view of debating than someone who was raised in a low-income household. How one perceives these different codes of conduct dictates one’s character.

Finally, the people that a person surrounds themselves with have a significant influence on their character. People who are surrounded by positive and strong influences in their lives tend to have higher self-esteem and are less susceptible to acting prematurely or rashly. Moreover, they learn from the example of the people around them and can learn how to handle different situations and what to expect when in different scenarios.

In conclusion, morals, social class, and people are all key contributors to the formation of a person's character. Everyone has different values and experiences that shape the person they become, and it is important to take the time to recognize how these elements create who we are.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"When it comes to schools having local partnerships, there are various risks and rewards involved. On one hand, schools can benefit from the expertise and resources that companies bring to the table. They can also provide students with a better understanding of the industry and potential career paths they can explore. On the other hand, this collaboration requires communication, trust, and a lot of effort to ensure that both parties come away with a positive outcome. 

Challenges that come with forming partnerships can range from not understanding the company's values and goals, to different levels of commitment between schools and businesses. On the other hand, benefits of collaboration can include access to mentors and resources, project-based learning opportunities, and more diverse classroom learning experiences. 

Successful businesses with local partnerships often create positive, lasting changes within their communities. For example, schools with strong business partnerships may have access to new technologies, mentors, and community resources. This can help students stay engaged in their studies and equip them with the skills they need to succeed. Additionally, these partnerships can open doors for students, offering internships and job prospects, while helping the community grow in the process. 

Through careful consideration and thoughtful partnerships, schools have the potential to become a much needed source of hope and opportunity for students. The risks and rewards of having a partnership with a local company should be carefully weighed out in order to maximize the benefits for students. By exploring these implications and establishing strategies that help students succeed, schools can create an environment that helps young adults to reach their highest potential.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

Being able to choose our own character is super important, you know?

Like, if you're into sports, you should be able to play sports without feeling like you have to do something else just because someone else wants you to. 🏈

It also helps us set goals for ourselves, like, if you want to be a scientist, you should be able to pursue that without feeling like you're gonna fail or something. 🔬 When we can choose our own character, we can be like, ""Hey, I wanna be a math whiz!"" or ""I wanna be a super artist!"" and then we can work towards that without feeling like we're doing something we don't really want to do. 🎨

"Online and video conferencing courses have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering students the flexibility and convenience of learning from anywhere, at any time. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to these types of courses, and they have different impacts on students who cannot attend school in the regular schedule.

One of the main advantages of online courses is that they provide students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This can be particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules, such as athletes, musicians, or those who work part-time jobs. Online courses also offer the opportunity for students to learn from anywhere, whether that be at home, in a coffee shop, or on a beach.

On the other hand, video conferencing courses have some disadvantages. For example, students may miss out on face-to-face interaction with their teachers and classmates, which can make it harder to build relationships and collaborate on projects. Additionally, video conferencing technology can be prone to technical issues, such as connectivity problems or poor audio quality, which can disrupt the learning experience.

Currently, there are many barriers that prevent students from attending school in the regular schedule. For example, some students may live in rural areas where access to high-quality educational resources is limited. Others may have health issues that make it difficult for them to attend school in person. Additionally, some students may have family obligations, such as taking care of younger siblings or working to support their families.

In terms of accessibility, online classes and video conferences offer different benefits. Online courses can be more accessible for students who live in remote areas or have mobility issues, as they can learn from anywhere with an internet connection. Video conferences, on the other hand, can be more accessible for students who have difficulty traveling or who live in areas with limited access to technology.

Another issue that affects students is the high dropout rate. According to a recent study, over 40% of students in the United States drop out of high school before finishing their studies. There are many reasons for this, including lack of motivation, lack of support from teachers and peers, and difficulty with the academic workload.

"Winston Churchill's phrase ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a powerful message that can be applied to everyday life. This phrase suggests that success is not about achieving perfection or never failing, but rather about maintaining a positive attitude and a willingness to keep trying even in the face of adversity.

One way to apply this phrase to everyday life is to view failures as opportunities for growth and learning. When we fail, we have the chance to reflect on what went wrong and to identify areas where we can improve. By maintaining a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, we can turn our failures into stepping stones on the path to success.

Another way to apply this phrase is to keep pushing forward even when we face challenges or setbacks. Life is full of obstacles, but by remaining enthusiastic and determined, we can overcome them and achieve our goals. This requires resilience and a strong sense of self-belief, which are qualities that Churchill himself possessed.

Churchill's accomplishments as Prime Minister of Britain are a testament to the qualities of this phrase. During his time in office, Churchill faced numerous challenges and setbacks, including the defeat of his party in the 1945 general election and the ongoing threat of Nazi Germany. However, he remained enthusiastic and determined in the face of these challenges, and his leadership ultimately led to the defeat of Nazi Germany and the establishment of a new era of peace and prosperity for Britain.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's phrase ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a powerful message that can be applied to everyday life. By maintaining a positive attitude and a willingness to learn and push forward, we can overcome challenges and achieve our goals. Churchill's own accomplishments as Prime Minister of Britain serve as a powerful example of the qualities of this phrase.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Schools around the world differ in how long they break for summer. In many places, the summer holidays can last anywhere from 6-10 weeks, while for the rest of the year, there are short breaks lasting around 1-3 weeks. While shorter breaks may seem more manageable for educational institutions to plan, it’s always been argued that having extended periods of summer break is important for students.

Firstly, the schoolwork that many students have to do can be overwhelming. Extended summer holidays give students a much-needed break from the pressures of school and allow them to recuperate mentally. This time helps students to relax and come back to school feeling refreshed, enabling them to tackle their studies with renewed enthusiasm.

During summer holidays, students can benefit from being exposed to new experiences, which can also encourage learnings outside the classroom and school walls. For example, summers provide a great opportunity to travel — allowing students to explore different cultures and expand their horizons. This will help them to grow and develop into well-rounded individuals.

Moreover, extended summer holidays can also allow students to pursue hobbies and interests that supplement what they learn in school. At home, students can dedicate time to reading books, working on creative projects, learning music or sports, and more. This can be done without any rush or worry, allowing students to take the time they need to work on their projects.

Overall, summer breaks allow students to take necessary time off from the academic rigor and can accelerate learning in the following year when students are able to tackle their studies with renewed motivation and perspective. Short breaks for the rest of the year provide mini breaks throughout the school year, which can be just as beneficial as longer breaks.

Hey, y'all! Today we're gonna talk about why it's important for humans to set their aims too high when they're trying to achieve their goals. Like, think about it, if you aim too low, you're only gonna get what you aimed for, but if you aim too high, you might get something way better!

First of all, let's talk about what happens when you aim too low. Like, if you want to get good grades in school, but you only aim for a C+, you might end up getting a C+, but that's it. You won't get any better than that. And that's not really worth it, right? You might as well aim for an A or a B, then you'll have a better chance of getting it.

But, on the other hand, when you aim too high, you might be surprised at how far you can go! Like, if you want to be a professional basketball player, but you aim for the NBA, you might not make it, but you might end up playing for a college team or even a minor league team. And that's still way better than if you had only aimed for the local rec league.

Another thing to consider is that when you aim too high, you're more likely to work harder and put in the effort to get there. Like, if you want to be a doctor, but you only aim for a job at the local hospital, you might not study as hard or put in as much effort as if you aimed for a top-tier medical school. And that's gonna make a big difference in the end!

So, in conclusion, setting your aims too high can lead to bigger and better things than if you aimed too low. And even if you don't reach your goal, you'll still end up farther ahead than if you had only aimed for something easy. So, go ahead and aim for the stars, y'all! You never know what you might achieve! 😃",1,llama2_chat,4
"Schools play an increasingly important role in today's society. An educational institution provides an opportunity to gain meaningful knowledge and learn skills that are essential for individuals to live and thrive in today's world. Schools offer a safe, supportive and collaborative environment that facilitates learning. With the help of teachers, students are exposed to numerous ways of learning. They are encouraged to explore, to ask questions, to establish meaningful relationships and to develop their problem-solving skills. 

At school, children are introduced to different sounds, colors, shapes and sizes. They learn how to make choices, recognize patterns, use language, count and sort items and develop problem-solving skills. Through a variety of activities such as storytelling, music, art and science experiments children learn to be creative and to think outside the box. Social interactions are developed through class projects and group work, teaching students the significance of teamwork and cooperation. 

Schools provide access to an array of educational materials, resources and technology, enabling pupils to learn about the current world and the possibilities that lie ahead. They also help to build fundamental values such as respect for all, honesty and responsibility. 

In summary, schools play a vital role in developing children physically, emotionally and academically. They offer a wealth of learning opportunities that help children and young adults to become good citizens of the world.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an 8th grader, I think it's super interesting to think about finishing high school early versus the traditional four-year timeframe. Like, I know some people who are really smart and can finish school early, but I'm not sure if it's the best choice for everyone.

So, one advantage of finishing high school early is that you can get a head start on your college education. Like, you can take college classes while you're still in high school, and that can save you money and time in the long run. Plus, you might be more mature and ready for college-level work, so you could potentially do better in college. That's pretty cool, right?

But, there are also some risks to finishing high school early. Like, you might not have as much time to figure out what you want to do after high school, and you might miss out on some important experiences that you would have had if you stayed in high school for four years. Plus, you might not have as much time to develop your social skills and make friends, which could make college harder.

I think the traditional four-year high school experience has its own advantages, too. Like, you get to learn and grow with your friends, and you have more time to figure out what you want to do after high school. Plus, you get to experience all the different classes and activities that high school has to offer, which can help you find your passion.

So, I think it's important to think about your own goals and needs when deciding whether to finish high school early or not. If you're really smart and can handle the workload, finishing early might be a good choice for you. But, if you're not sure what you want to do after high school or if you want to have more time to develop your social skills, maybe it's better to stick with the traditional four-year experience.

Overall, I think it's important to think carefully about your options and make the choice that's best for you. Finishing high school early can be a good choice for some people, but it's not the right choice for everyone.",1,llama2_chat,0
"Failure is a natural part of the pursuit of success. When we fail, we learn from our mistakes and persevere in finding ways to succeed. Without taking risks, we would never reach our goals and be able to fully achieve our potential. Alongside taking chances and learning from our mistakes, enthusiasm also plays an essential role in our success. Being passionate and driven motivates us to stay focused and empowered. When we put effort into our projects and dreams, we increase our chances of succeeding and reaping the rewards for our hard work. We should be excited and inspired by our goals, and cultivate a positive attitude and proactive approach to work towards achieving them. By understanding that failure is a necessary part of success and embracing our enthusiasm, we can reach our goals and be successful.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an eighth-grade student, it is essential to understand the implications of following the beliefs and opinions of others and how those views may conflict with one's own. It is crucial to remain true to oneself and follow one's dreams, but it is also important to be aware of the potential negative consequences of doing so.

Discrimination can make a person feel isolated and unsupported, which can be detrimental to their mental and emotional well-being. It is important to combat such feelings by standing up for oneself and others who may be experiencing discrimination. This can be done through advocacy, education, and activism.

Research has shown that remaining true to oneself and following one's dreams can lead to greater satisfaction and fulfillment in life. However, it is also important to be aware of the potential negative consequences, such as rejection, criticism, and failure. It is crucial to strike a balance between pursuing one's dreams and being resilient during difficult or challenging times.

To remain resilient during difficult or challenging times while maintaining one's individual identity, it is important to have a strong support system, practice self-care, and seek help when needed. It is also important to stay true to one's values and beliefs, even in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, it is essential to consider the implications of following the beliefs and opinions of others and how those views may conflict with one's own. It is crucial to remain true to oneself and follow one's dreams, but it is also important to be aware of the potential negative consequences and to be resilient during difficult or challenging times while maintaining one's individual identity. By doing so, we can achieve greater satisfaction and fulfillment in life while also making a positive impact on the world around us.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Education is a fundamental part of life. It can be a chore or a pleasant experience, depending on how activities are implemented. When done right, activities can be enjoyable and educational simultaneously. This essay will explore the concept of education activities that are both enjoyable and educational by looking at examples from science experiments, sports activities, and playing instruments.

Science experiments are an often overlooked source of educational activities that can be enjoyable. For younger students, easy experiments such as growing plants, producing audio waves, or exploring the natural world with a microscope can provide hours of enjoyable education. Not only does this give children an opportunity to use their bodies, minds, and senses, but it also helps engage their curiosity, problem-solving skills, and ability to think critically.

Sports activities are also an excellent way to make learning enjoyable. Team sports, races, and competitions can bring out the best of children, who are looking for a chance to learn and grow at the same time. It can be as simple as playing a game of tag, where the children have to use their knowledge of math and geometry, or using a basketball court to illustrate the basics of angles and trajectories. This can be an incredibly effective way to make learning fun and memorable.

Finally, playing musical instruments can be both enjoyable and educational. This can include learning to play a guitar, singing along with a choir, or mastering the drums. These activities require the use of key listening, coordination, and analytical skills, while also allowing the student to explore music theory, composition, and history. This type of activity can also foster a sense of accomplishment and pride in the student, making it an enjoyable educational experience.

In conclusion, educational activities can be both enjoyable and educational when done right. Through using examples from science experiments, sports activities, and playing instruments, we have seen how educational activities can engage children on multiple levels, while also providing an avenue for personal growth and satisfaction. As such, educational activities should be seen as an ideal way to foster long lasting learning that can be both enjoyable and educational.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Technology has had a profound effect on almost every aspect of modern life. It has helped us to stay connected with our loved ones around the world, expand our knowledge, and make tasks easier and faster. But it has also come with its own share of drawbacks. In this essay, I will explore both the positive and negative aspects of technology. 

On the positive side, technology has allowed us to be more productive than ever before. We are able to access vast amounts of information in a matter of seconds. We can communicate and connect with people faster and easier than ever before, allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family spread around the globe. Technology also makes it easier to automate tedious tasks, allowing us to work more efficiently. 

However, there are some possible drawbacks to technology as well. One of the biggest concerns is the distraction that technology can provide, as people become easily distracted by their devices or the various forms of media available online. It can also be an isolating force, causing people to become more disconnected from real-life interactions. Another issue is cyber security, as hackers and malicious software can put our personal information and data at risk. 

In conclusion, the development of technology has had both positive and negative impacts on our lives. Despite the possible drawbacks, technology can be used as a powerful tool to increase productivity, connectivity, and knowledge. As long as we are mindful of how we use technology, we can reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" highlights the importance of stepping out of our comfort zones and challenging ourselves to achieve more. This principle applies to people in different situations, including those who have more opportunities to grow compared to those on the street.

For example, in the workplace, employees who are given challenging tasks and responsibilities are more likely to develop new skills and knowledge, leading to personal and professional growth. On the other hand, employees who are given repetitive and routine tasks may stagnate and fail to develop new skills, limiting their potential for growth.

Similarly, in education, students who are encouraged to take on challenging courses and projects are more likely to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, leading to academic and personal success. On the other hand, students who are given easy assignments and lack challenging opportunities may not develop these skills, limiting their potential for growth.

However, not everyone has equal access to opportunities for growth and development. People living in poverty or in disadvantaged communities may have limited access to resources and opportunities, making it difficult for them to challenge themselves and achieve their full potential.

To address this issue and help people realize their potential, there are several things that can be done. Firstly, governments and organizations can invest in programs and initiatives that provide equal access to education and job training opportunities for people from all backgrounds. This can help to level the playing field and provide everyone with the opportunity to challenge themselves and achieve their full potential.

Secondly, individuals can take the initiative to seek out opportunities for growth and development, even if they are not readily available. This can involve taking on challenging tasks at work, seeking out new experiences and learning opportunities, and pursuing personal interests and passions.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" highlights the importance of stepping out of our comfort zones and challenging ourselves to achieve more. This principle applies to people in different situations, including those who have more opportunities to grow compared to those on the street.

"Essay: Pros and Cons of Attending a Normal School vs. Distance Learning

Introduction:

With the rise of technology and the internet, distance learning has become a popular alternative to traditional classroom learning. However, attending a normal school has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. In this essay, I will outline the pros and cons of attending a regular school and distance learning, using real-life examples to support my argument.

Pros of Attending a Normal School:

1. Social Interaction: Attending a regular school allows students to interact with their peers and teachers face-to-face. This social interaction is important for building relationships and developing social skills, such as communication and teamwork.

Example: I have a friend who attended a distance learning program, and she often felt isolated and disconnected from her peers. She missed out on important social interactions and struggled to make friends.

2. Hands-on Learning: Traditional classrooms provide students with the opportunity to engage in hands-on learning experiences, such as laboratory experiments and group projects. These experiences help students to retain information and develop practical skills.

Example: In my science class, we recently conducted an experiment where we grew crystals using a saturated solution. This hands-on experience helped me to understand the concept of crystal formation in a more tangible way.

3. Access to Resources: Regular schools typically have more resources available to students, such as libraries, computer labs, and sports facilities. These resources can enhance the learning experience and provide students with additional opportunities for growth.

Example: My school has a state-of-the-art computer lab, which allows us to complete assignments and conduct research using a variety of software and tools.

Cons of Attending a Normal School:

1. Limited Flexibility: Traditional classrooms have a fixed schedule, which can be limiting for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities.

Example: I play on my school's soccer team, and sometimes I have to miss classes to attend practices or games. If I were in a distance learning program, I could attend these events without falling behind in my studies.

2. Lack of Personalization: Traditional classrooms can be imp",1,llama2_chat,3
"Playing a sport in a community park is a great way to enjoy time outdoors. It gives you the chance to get fresh air in a beautiful setting while also having fun with your friends and family. Plus, depending on the sport, it can help you keep fit and stay active.

One of the best things about playing in a park is the sense of community it creates. Taking part in a game is a great way to get to know your neighbors and neighbors from the local area. It's also a great way to meet new people, since parks often attract people from wider afield.

Playing a sport in a park also provides an opportunity to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. The sounds of birds singing is a sure sign that spring has sprung. The luscious green grass provides an inviting spot to stretch out after a hard-fought game.

In addition, there is often an array of park amenities that can be enjoyed before and after your game. These can include playgrounds, picnic tables, and barbecues. You can plan an afternoon of sport and relaxation with your family or friends.

Overall, playing a sport in a community park is a safe, socially-distanced activity that is enjoyable for all ages. It's a great way to get out and reconnect with nature while spending quality time with those you love.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research methods used to build self-esteem in students. Like, it's super important for us to have good self-esteem, you know? It can help us feel more confident and stuff. 

So, I found out that there are two main ways to build self-esteem in students: praising and achieving.  Praising means, like, giving someone positive feedback for things they do well, like ""Great job on that project!"" or ""You're so smart!""  And achieving means, like, accomplishing things, like getting good grades or making a cool craft. 

But, here's the thing...  Some people think that praising is more effective than achieving in building self-esteem. Like, if someone only gets praised for things they do well, they might start to think that they're only good at those things and not anything else.  But, if they achieve something, like get an A on a test, they'll feel good about themselves no matter what they're good at. 

However, other people think that achieving is more important than praising. Like, if someone works hard and achieves something, they'll feel more proud of themselves than if someone just gives them a compliment.  And, if someone only gets praised for things they don't really care about, it won't mean as much to them. 

So, in my opinion, both praising and achieving are important for building self-esteem in students.  It's like, you can't just rely on one or the other, you know? You need to do both.  Like, give someone positive feedback for things they do well, but also encourage them to achieve their goals. 

I think this is important because, like, self-esteem is something that can really affect how we feel about ourselves and how we do in school.  If we have good self-esteem, we're more likely to be confident",1,llama2_chat,4
"Half-day school plans have been a topic of debate for many years. Some people believe that a half-day school schedule would be beneficial for students, while others argue that it would not be effective. In this essay, I will argue for half-day school plans, offering evidence and elaboration to support my argument.

First, it is important to consider the benefits of a half-day school schedule. One of the biggest advantages is that it would allow students to have more time for extracurricular activities. Many students are involved in sports, clubs, and other extracurricular activities, but they often struggle to balance these activities with their schoolwork. With a half-day school schedule, students would have more time to participate in these activities without sacrificing their education.

Another benefit of a half-day school schedule is that it would allow students to have more time for personal development. Students would have more time to pursue their interests and hobbies, which could lead to increased creativity and self-awareness. This could also lead to a more well-rounded education, as students would be exposed to a wider range of subjects and experiences.

In addition to these benefits, a half-day school schedule could also be more effective for some students. For example, students who learn better in smaller, more focused settings may benefit from a half-day schedule. With fewer students in the classroom, teachers could provide more individualized attention to each student, leading to better academic outcomes.

Furthermore, a half-day school schedule could also be more efficient for schools. With fewer students in the building, schools would require fewer resources, such as classrooms, textbooks, and other materials. This could lead to cost savings for schools, which could be used to improve other aspects of the school, such as facilities or technology.

In conclusion, half-day school plans have many benefits that could be beneficial for students, schools, and society as a whole. With more time for extracurricular activities, personal development, and individualized attention, students would be better equipped to succeed academically and personally. Additionally, schools would be more efficient and cost-effective, allowing them to focus on improving other aspects of the school. Therefore, I strongly believe that half-day school plans should be implemented in schools across the country.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Spending time at a community park is a great way to improve one's overall well-being. Not only does it provide a safe and welcoming environment for people of all ages, but it also offers numerous benefits that can enhance our lives in various ways.

First and foremost, community parks provide an excellent opportunity for people to strengthen their bonds with friends and family. Whether it's playing a game of frisbee, having a picnic, or simply taking a walk together, spending time at a park allows us to connect with the people we care about in a more meaningful way. This can help to build stronger relationships and create lasting memories that we will cherish for years to come.

In addition to strengthening social connections, community parks also provide a great place to exercise and stay active. There are a variety of sports and activities that can be enjoyed at a park, from basketball and soccer to hiking and biking. These activities not only help to keep us in shape, but they also provide a fun and engaging way to stay active and improve our overall health and well-being.

Finally, community parks can also be a great place to do school work quietly. With their open spaces and peaceful surroundings, parks can provide a distraction-free environment that is perfect for studying and completing homework assignments. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with concentration or who need a change of scenery to help them stay focused.

In conclusion, spending time at a community park can provide a wide range of benefits that can improve our overall well-being. From strengthening social connections to exercising and doing school work, community parks offer a safe and welcoming environment that can help us lead happier, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.

"Many great inventors, such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, have attributed their success to hard work and persistence. They believed that if you work on something every day, eventually you will succeed. Their lives have provided us with numerous examples of how constant work and effort can help you reach your goals. Similarly, many companies have achieved success by continuously striving to improve their products, services, and processes. 

Furthermore, staying still and inactive can sometimes be beneficial as well. It can give you time to reflect on your work, consider ideas, and devise a plan of action. Inactivity allows you to be creative and thoughtful when it comes to your work. 

These examples demonstrate how important hard work and practice are when it comes to achieving success. Research shows that the more effort you put into something, the more likely you are to experience positive results. This supports the popular saying, “Practice makes perfect.”",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Making a positive first impression is immensely important when meeting someone for the first time. It can have a powerful effect on the success or failure of any relationship, be it with a colleague, friend, or romantic partner. A positive first impression can lead to trust, successful collaborations, and meaningful connections, while a negative first impression can quickly ruin an opportunity or sour a relationship.

Take job opportunities, for example. A potential employer base much of their decisions on an applicant’s first impression. Studies have shown that applicants who are well groomed, confident with their communication, and present themselves with respect and enthusiasm are much more likely to be hired. The same principle applies when looking for new friends or romantic partners. People tend to be attracted to confidence and enjoy talking to someone who communicates clearly.

When it comes to establishing good relationships with peers, a positive first impression goes a long way. People who are kind, calm, and welcoming are more likely to be liked and respected. It's almost a guarantee that an individual who exudes confidence and respect will make a better impression than someone who exudes anger and distrust.

In conclusion, it is incredibly important to strive for a positive first impression when meeting someone for the first time. Making a strong first impression can be the difference between getting an opportunity or losing out to a competitor, building strong relationships or souring them instantly, and being liked by peers or respected by them.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Dear Professor,

I strongly agree with the decision that kids should participate in activities after school. Participation in after-school activities can have numerous benefits for children, including personal development, socialization, and academic success.

Firstly, participating in after-school activities can help children develop their interests and passions. Activities such as sports, music, drama, and art can provide children with opportunities to explore their interests and develop their skills. This can lead to a greater sense of self-fulfillment and a sense of purpose.

Secondly, engaging in after-school activities can also help children develop their social skills. Participating in group activities such as sports teams or clubs can help children learn to work with others, communicate effectively, and resolve conflicts. This can help children build strong relationships and make new friends.

Finally, participating in after-school activities can also have a positive impact on academic success. Studies have shown that children who participate in after-school activities tend to have higher grades and test scores than those who do not. This is because participating in activities can help children develop discipline, time management, and other skills that are essential for academic success.

In conclusion, I believe that participation in after-school activities is an essential part of a child's development. It can provide children with opportunities to explore their interests, develop their social skills, and achieve academic success. I strongly urge parents and educators to encourage children to participate in after-school activities.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey there,

Technology is pretty cool and all, but it's not all rainbows and butterflies. In fact, there are some pretty negative impacts of technology that we should talk about. Now, I know some people might say that technology is awesome and has made our lives way easier, but I'm here to tell you that it's not all good. Here are three main ways technology has a negative impact on people:

First off, technology can be super distracting. Like, have you seen how many notifications you get on your phone? It's like, every five seconds someone is messaging you or posting something on social media. And don't even get me started on video games. I mean, I love playing Fortnite as much as the next guy, but sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in front of the screen for hours on end. It's like, how are we supposed to focus on our schoolwork or anything else when we're constantly getting notifications? It's like, our brains are just wired to be distracted all the time. And that's not good.

Second, technology can be really bad for our health. Like, have you heard of blue light? It's the light that comes from screens, and it's supposed to be really bad for your eyes. And it's not just your eyes, either. Studies have shown that using technology for too long can lead to obesity, sleep problems, and even depression. I mean, who wants to be stuck in front of a screen all day? Not me, that's for sure. And it's not just us, either. Our parents and grandparents are probably getting affected by technology too. I mean, have you seen how many older people are on their phones all the time? It's like, they're trying to stay connected with their grandkids, but it's not good for them in the long run.

Lastly, technology can be super addictive. Like, I know I'm guilty of spending way too much time on my phone. And it's not just me. Studies have shown that people can get addicted to technology",1,llama2_chat,4
"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many students opting to learn from the comfort of their own homes. While this can be a convenient option, it can also come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to distractions. In this essay, I will analyze how distance learning can affect students due to distractions such as video games, phones, or lack of sleep.

One of the biggest challenges of distance learning is staying focused and avoiding distractions. With the internet at our fingertips, it can be easy to get sidetracked by social media, video games, or other online activities. For some students, these distractions can be particularly tempting, as they may not have the same level of accountability as they would in a traditional classroom setting. Without the constant monitoring of a teacher, it can be easy to procrastinate and fall behind on assignments.

Another challenge of distance learning is maintaining a healthy work-life balance. With the flexibility of learning from home, it can be easy to blur the lines between work and personal time. This can lead to students working long hours and neglecting their own needs, such as getting enough sleep or taking breaks. Without the structure of a traditional school schedule, it can be difficult for students to maintain a healthy routine and ensure that they are getting the rest and relaxation they need to succeed.

In addition to these challenges, distance learning can also affect students' mental health. Without the social interaction and support of a traditional classroom, some students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers. This can lead to feelings of depression or anxiety, which can in turn affect their academic performance. Furthermore, the constant pressure to perform well academically can be overwhelming for some students, leading to stress and burnout.

In conclusion, while distance learning can be a convenient option for many students, it comes with its own set of challenges. In particular, students must be aware of the potential distractions that come with learning from home and take steps to stay focused and maintain a healthy work-life balance. By doing so, they can ensure that they are getting the most out of their distance learning experience and setting themselves up for success in the future.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"After much research and analysis, it is clear that adding an extra hour and a half to the school day can have both positive and negative implications for students, teachers, and their families. On one side, students would be able to gain more opportunities to have more class time to complete their coursework, have additional tutoring, and benefit from other extended educational experiences. On the other hand, studies suggest that increasing the school day could also lead to higher levels of stress for both students and teachers, increased behavioral issues in the classrooms, and less family time. Furthermore, if parents are not able to adjust their work hours to accommodate the extended school days, this could lead to further challenges for the students and potential childcare issues for the families. While the extra hour and a half of school time could provide additional educational opportunities, it is important to consider the balance of benefits and risks in order to make an informed decision.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

So, I know this is like, super important and stuff, but let's be real, working in groups can be, like, super annoying sometimes. I mean, have you ever had to work with someone who just doesn't get it? Like, they're just not putting in the effort, and it's like, come on, guys, we gotta do this together! 🙄

But, on the other hand, working alone can be, like, super easy. I mean, you don't have to worry about anyone else's drama or whatever, and you can just focus on the task at hand. Plus, you can like, totally do things your own way and not have to, like, compromise or anything. 😅

"As an eighth-grade student, I have been fortunate enough to attend classes both in school and from home. While both options have their advantages, I believe attending classes in school is ultimately more beneficial. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of attending classes in school versus attending classes from home, and argue that attending classes in school is the better option.

Firstly, attending classes in school provides students with a structured environment that is conducive to learning. In school, students are surrounded by their peers and teachers, who can provide support and guidance when needed. This structured environment helps students stay focused and motivated, which ultimately leads to better academic performance. Additionally, attending classes in school allows students to engage in group activities and discussions, which can help them develop important social and communication skills.

On the other hand, attending classes from home can be more flexible and convenient for students. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be more comfortable and less stressful than attending classes in school. Additionally, attending classes from home can be more cost-effective, as students do not have to pay for transportation, school supplies, or other expenses associated with attending classes in school.

However, there are several drawbacks to attending classes from home. For one, students may be more likely to procrastinate and fall behind on their work. Without the structure of a school environment, students may not feel as motivated to attend classes and complete their assignments. Additionally, attending classes from home can make it more difficult for students to interact with their peers and teachers, which can limit their opportunities for social and academic growth.

In conclusion, while attending classes from home has its advantages, attending classes in school is ultimately more beneficial. The structured environment of a school setting provides students with the support and guidance they need to succeed academically, while also allowing them to engage in important social and communication skills. While attending classes from home may be more flexible and convenient, the drawbacks of procrastination and limited interaction with peers and teachers can outweigh the benefits.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Working together in a group can bring several benefits, including increased productivity, faster problem-solving, and the ability to tackle larger projects. Thanks to the power of collaboration, a team of people working together can often accomplish more than the same number of people working independently. For instance, a small group of people tasked with cleaning up a park might be able to finish the job much more quickly if each person takes on a different corner than if they all clean the same area. With problem-solving, too, a group setting can result in a quicker solution than working alone. If a team of five people each put their heads together with the goal of finding the most efficient route for a delivery, chances are they will come up with a better solution than one individual working on it. Finally, working together in a group opens the door to tackling larger, more complex projects than any one person could do on their own. From a collaborative art piece to a complicated engineering project, forming a group increases the likelihood of success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it has many benefits for students who have disabilities or who may not feel like they are good at school. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of distance learning for these students and why it is an excellent option for them.

Firstly, distance learning allows students with disabilities to learn at their own pace. This is particularly important for students with learning disabilities, who may need more time to process information and complete tasks. With distance learning, these students can work at their own pace without feeling pressured to keep up with their peers. This can help them to feel more confident in their abilities and more comfortable in the learning environment.

Secondly, distance learning provides a more personalized learning experience for students who may not feel like they are good at school. These students may struggle with traditional classroom settings, where they feel like they are not meeting the expectations of their peers or teachers. With distance learning, they can work with a tutor or mentor who can provide personalized support and guidance. This can help them to feel more engaged in the learning process and more motivated to succeed.

Thirdly, distance learning can help to reduce the stress and anxiety that many students experience in traditional classroom settings. For students with disabilities or who may not feel like they are good at school, the pressure to perform can be overwhelming. With distance learning, they can work at their own pace and in a more comfortable environment, which can help to reduce their stress and anxiety levels.

Finally, distance learning can provide students with more flexibility in their schedules. This is particularly important for students who have other responsibilities, such as caring for a family member or working a part-time job. With distance learning, they can work when it is most convenient for them, which can help them to balance their education with their other responsibilities.

In conclusion, distance learning has many benefits for students who have disabilities or who may not feel like they are good at school. It allows them to learn at their own pace, provides a more personalized learning experience, reduces stress and anxiety, and provides more flexibility in their schedules. For these students, distance learning is an excellent option that can help them to succeed in their education and achieve their goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Title: The Importance of Coding and Teamwork in Robotics

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write about my findings on the job of Robotics, specifically focusing on coding and building components of a robot. In this essay, I'll be discussing the purpose of coding and how it relates to the movement of a robot, as well as investigating how teams of people can work together to build robots and how it's different from individual work.

Purpose of Coding:
Coding is a crucial part of robotics because it allows us to give instructions to the robot on what it should do. Just like how we use instructions to make a cake or build a house, coding gives the robot specific commands to perform tasks. For example, if we want a robot to pick up a object and move it to a different location, we would write a code that tells the robot to do just that. Without coding, a robot would be like a machine without a brain, unable to perform any tasks.

Coding and Movement:
Coding and movement are closely related in robotics. The code tells the robot how to move, whether it's moving forward, backward, left, or right. The code also allows the robot to avoid obstacles and navigate through different environments. For instance, if we're building a robot to navigate through a maze, the code would tell the robot how to turn, stop, and move forward based on the obstacles it encounters.

Teamwork in Robotics:
Building robots isn't just about coding, it's also about working together as a team. When building a robot, multiple people are involved in different aspects of the project, such as designing, coding, and assembling. This allows for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives, which can lead to more creative and innovative solutions. For example, while one person may be working on the coding, another person may be working on the design of the robot, and another person may be working on the assembly.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, coding is a crucial part of robotics that allows us to give instructions to the robot on what it should do. Coding and movement are closely related, as the code tells",1,llama2_chat,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have seen firsthand the power of a small act of kindness. Whether it's a smile, a compliment, or a helping hand, these small gestures can have a huge impact on people's lives. In this essay, I will explore the significance of a single act of kindness and how it can change the course of someone's day.

One of the most significant ways that a small act of kindness can impact someone's life is through their mental health. A simple act of kindness, such as a compliment or a hug, can make someone feel seen and valued. This can be especially important for people who are struggling with feelings of isolation or depression. When someone feels like they are not valued or appreciated, it can be difficult for them to see the bright side of things. However, a small act of kindness can help to break through these negative thoughts and provide a glimmer of hope.

Another way that a small act of kindness can impact someone's life is through their relationships. When someone does something kind for someone else, it can create a bond between them. This can be especially important for people who are new to a community or who are struggling to make friends. A small act of kindness can help to break the ice and create a foundation for a stronger relationship.

Finally, a small act of kindness can also have a significant impact on someone's physical health. When someone is stressed or anxious, it can take a toll on their physical health. This can manifest in a variety of ways, including headaches, stomachaches, and even chronic illnesses. However, a small act of kindness can help to reduce stress and anxiety, which can in turn improve someone's physical health.

In conclusion, a small act of kindness can have a huge impact on someone's life. Whether it's through their mental health, relationships, or physical health, a small act of kindness can make all the difference. As an eighth-grade student, I encourage all of my peers to practice kindness in their daily lives. Even small gestures, such as a smile or a compliment, can make a big difference.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

"an inspiration for those who have faced failure and are looking for guidance on how to overcome it.

Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it can be a difficult experience to go through. However, it is important to remember that failure is not the end of the road. In fact, failure can often be a stepping stone to success.

One way to confront failure is to stay enthusiastic and optimistic. Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote is a reminder that it is important to keep a positive attitude and not let failure discourage us. Even when we fail, we should continue to work towards our goals with enthusiasm and determination.

Another example of how failure can lead to success is the story of a scientist who tried many experiments in order to find one successful result. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of the scientific process, and it is through failure that we learn and grow. Without failure, we would not have the knowledge and understanding that we have today.

When we face failure, it is important to stay positive and not give up. Feeling depressed and giving up can be a dangerous path, as it can lead to a lack of motivation and a loss of direction. On the other hand, staying positive and feeling secure after a failure can give us the strength and resilience to continue working towards our goals.

The book, ""The Life of an Indian"", serves as an inspiration for those who have faced failure and are looking for guidance on how to overcome it. The book tells the story of a young Indian boy who faced many challenges and failures in his life, but ultimately achieved great success. The book is a reminder that with hard work, determination, and a positive attitude, we can overcome even the greatest obstacles.

In conclusion, failure is an inevitable part of life, but it is important to remember that it is not the end of the road. By staying enthusiastic and optimistic, we can confront failure and use it as a stepping stone to success. The example of a scientist trying many experiments in order to find one successful result is a reminder that failure is a natural part of the process of growth and learning. When we face failure, it is important to stay positive and not give up, as this can lead to a lack of motivation and a loss of direction. The",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"The idea of a four-day work week with ten hour days is gaining traction in the business world - and for good reason. Many studies suggest that this type of schedule can maximize productivity and energy levels while reducing fatigue and increasing employee satisfaction. In terms of energy use, the compact time frame of this type of arrangement means that less energy is consumed overall. In addition, employees often report feeling more motivated and refreshed due to the additional day off. This can increase productivity, as employees have more time to rest and recharge. While the five day work week is the more traditional option, the four day work week with ten hour days has the potential to bring benefits to both the employer and the employee.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that a person has about another person. They are formed within seconds of meeting someone and can greatly influence the way people interact with each other. First impressions can be used to reflect someone's personality in various ways.

One way first impressions can reflect someone's personality is through their appearance. For example, if a person is dressed in a clean and well-fitting suit, they may be perceived as confident and professional. On the other hand, if a person is wearing dirty clothes and has unkempt hair, they may be perceived as careless and unprofessional.

Another way first impressions can reflect someone's personality is through their behavior and attitude. For example, if a person is smiling, making eye contact, and showing interest in the conversation, they may be perceived as friendly and approachable. On the other hand, if a person is frowning, avoiding eye contact, and appearing distant, they may be perceived as unfriendly and unapproachable.

First impressions can also have a lasting impact on relationships. For example, if someone makes a negative first impression on a potential friend or colleague, they may struggle to form a positive relationship with that person in the future. On the other hand, if someone makes a positive first impression, they may be more likely to form a strong and lasting relationship with that person.

Kindness and respect for others can also help form positive first impressions. When a person is kind and respectful towards others, they may be perceived as compassionate and empathetic. This can lead to a positive first impression and may make it easier for that person to form strong relationships with others.

However, it is important to note that first impressions can be impossible to change. Once a person has formed an initial opinion about someone, it can be difficult to change that opinion. This is because first impressions are based on limited information and can be influenced by factors such as the person's appearance, behavior, and attitude.

In conclusion, first impressions can greatly influence the way people interact with each other. They can reflect someone's personality through their appearance, behavior, and attitude. First impressions can also have a lasting impact on relationships and can be shaped by kindness and respect for others. While first impressions can be difficult to change, it is important to be aware of them and strive to",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom has both pros and cons. While cell phones can be a useful tool for students to access educational resources and stay connected with family, they can also be a major distraction and waste class time.

On the one hand, cell phones can provide students with access to a wealth of educational resources. With the internet at their fingertips, students can quickly find information on any topic and use apps to help them learn. Additionally, cell phones can be a convenient way for students to stay in touch with their families, especially during long school days. This can help alleviate stress and provide a sense of comfort and support.

On the other hand, cell phones can also be a major distraction for students. With so many apps and social media platforms available, it can be easy for students to get sidetracked and waste class time. Additionally, cell phones can be a distraction for other students, as they can easily become a source of noise and disruption in the classroom. This can make it difficult for other students to focus and learn.

In my opinion, the benefits of allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom outweigh the potential distractions. However, it is important for students to use their cell phones responsibly and for teachers to set clear guidelines for their use in the classroom. This can help ensure that cell phones are used for educational purposes and do not become a source of distraction for other students.

In conclusion, allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom has both pros and cons. While cell phones can be a useful tool for students to access educational resources and stay connected with family, they can also be a major distraction and waste class time. It is important for students to use their cell phones responsibly and for teachers to set clear guidelines for their use in the classroom.

"Dear Principal [Principal's Name],

I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed addition of one and a half more hours to the school day. While I understand the need to increase the amount of time for learning, I strongly believe that this proposal will have a negative impact on students and teachers.

Firstly, the additional hours will take away valuable time for after school activities. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other extracurricular activities that are essential for their personal and social development. By extending the school day, students will have less time to participate in these activities, which will limit their opportunities to learn new skills and make new friends. For example, my friend, who is a member of the school debate team, has to give up his practice sessions because of the extended school day. This is a great loss for him, as he has been working hard to improve his skills and prepare for competitions.

Secondly, the additional hours will put a strain on teachers' income. Teachers already work long hours, and adding more time to the school day will require them to work even longer hours, which will lead to a decrease in their pay. This will create a situation where teachers are overworked and underpaid, which will lead to a decrease in the quality of education. For example, my math teacher has been working long hours to prepare for the upcoming exams, and adding more hours to the school day will only make her workload more overwhelming.

Finally, the additional hours will make students tired and unmotivated. Students already spend a significant amount of time in school, and adding more hours will only make them more tired and less motivated to learn. This will lead to a decrease in the quality of education, as students will be less engaged and less focused. For example, my friend, who is a member of the school band, has been struggling to keep up with his homework because he is too tired from school.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the proposed addition of one and a half more hours to the school day will have a negative impact on students and teachers. It will take away valuable time for after school activities, put a strain on teachers' income, and make students tired and unmotivated. I urge you to reconsider this proposal and find alternative ways to improve the quality of education without adding more hours to the school day.

"Many people agree that pushing yourself to do something outside of your comfort zone is an important aspect of growth and development. Taking on challenges that are unfamiliar or difficult can help a person gain experiences and knowledge, allowing them to progress and develop as an individual. It can be hard to step out of our comfort zones, but it can also be incredibly rewarding. 

On the other hand, some people disagree with this statement. They believe that tailoring our endeavors to our existing skills and abilities can also lead to growth. Through practice and refinement of what we have mastered, we can become highly skilled in that area. Pursuing interests within our comfort zone can also lead to success, and could even lead to areas of growth or learning that were not previously considered.

My opinion is that I generally agree with the statement “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.” While every situation is different and can be approached in various ways, I think there is a great opportunity to be seized when one pushes themselves to do something that initially seems difficult. Taking on a challenge can help us gain knowledge and experiences that can be used to foster further growth, and can also introduce us to interesting new ideas and opportunities.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey there!  So, you want me to write an essay about the benefits of shorter school time, huh?  Well, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not super excited about it, but I'll give it a shot. 

First of all, let's talk about why shorter school time would be beneficial for students.  I mean, think about it, having more free time after school would be awesome!  We could do more extracurricular activities, hang out with friends, or even just relax and watch TV.  It's like, our brains need a break from all that learning and stuff, you know?  Plus, shorter school days could lead to better grades and test scores, since we wouldn't be so tired and cranky from being in school for so long. 

But,  I know some people might say that shorter school time wouldn't be good for us, like, it would make us less prepared for college or the workforce.  But, I don't think that's true.  Like, think about it, if we had more time after school, we could pursue our passions and interests, like, maybe start a business or learn a new skill.  And,  if we're not so tired and stressed from school, we could focus better in class and learn more. 

Now,  let's talk about celebrities like Eminem.  I know some people might say that they're not a good example, since they didn't finish high school or college.  But,  I think they're still a good example, because they showed that with hard work and dedication, you can achieve your dreams, even if you don't have a traditional education.  And,  they're rich and famous, so they must be doing something right, right?

I'm super excited to write about the positive effects of technology on people!  I mean, who doesn't love technology, right? It's like, the coolest thing ever! 

So, one of the most awesome things about technology is how it helps people communicate with each other!  Like, imagine being able to talk to your best friend who lives on the other side of the world!  You can just send them a message or make a video call, and boom! You're hanging out like you're in the same room! 

And it's not just for fun! Technology can also help people communicate in emergency situations!  Like, if someone is in a car accident or has a medical emergency, they can just call 911 on their phone!  It's like, instant help!  They can even send pictures or videos of what's happening to show the emergency responders! 

For example, my cousin was on a camping trip and got lost in the woods. She called 911 on her phone, and they were able to find her super fast!  She was so grateful that she could call for help so easily! 

Another example is when my friend's grandma had a heart attack. She called 911 on her phone, and the ambulance got there super fast!  She was saved! 

So, in conclusion, technology is super cool and helps people communicate with each other and get help in emergency situations!  It's like, the best thing ever!

"As an average 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool to imagine that I could graduate from high school in just three years instead of the usual four. I mean, who doesn't want to get out of high school a year early and start their adult life even sooner? But, I also know that there are some pretty big pros and cons to consider when it comes to graduating early.

First of all, let's talk about the good stuff. If you graduate early, you get to skip that extra year of high school and all the stuff that comes with it, like more homework, more exams, and more drama with your friends. You also get to start college or start your career even sooner, which can be really exciting. Plus, you might feel more prepared for the real world because you're getting out there and experiencing things earlier.

But, there are also some pretty big challenges that come with graduating early. For one thing, you might not have as much time to figure out what you want to do with your life. High school is a time when you're supposed to explore your interests and figure out what you're good at, and if you're not there for the full four years, you might not have as much time to do that. And, if you're not sure what you want to do after high school, it can be really hard to make the transition to college or the workforce.

So, why do I think the three year high school graduation should be encouraged? Well, I think it's because it gives students like me more freedom and flexibility. If I can graduate early, I can start college or start my career earlier, which means I can get out there and start making my own way in the world even sooner. And, even though it might be harder to figure out what I want to do with my life, I think the experience of being out in the world and trying new things will help me figure it out faster.

In conclusion, while there are definitely some pros and cons to graduating high school in three years, I think it's something that more students should consider. It gives us more freedom and flexibility, and can help us get out there and start making our own way in the world even sooner. So, if you're thinking about graduating early,",1,llama2_chat,3
"Positive attitude is a crucial aspect of achieving success in life. It is an essential component of our daily lives, and it can significantly impact our ability to achieve our goals. In this essay, I will discuss the relationship between positive attitude and success in various areas of life, including job opportunities, friendships, and overall health. I will also explain why it is important to think positively and how doing so may lead to greater success.

Firstly, having a positive attitude can greatly increase our chances of success in the workplace. When we approach our jobs with a positive attitude, we are more likely to be productive and efficient. We are more likely to take on new challenges and learn from our mistakes, which can lead to growth and development. For example, when I was working on a group project in my English class, my group members and I had to come up with a presentation on the importance of positive thinking. We decided to focus on how positive thinking can improve our overall well-being and productivity. We worked together as a team, and our presentation was a huge success. We received an excellent grade, and our teacher was impressed with our hard work and dedication.

Secondly, having a positive attitude can also help us build stronger friendships. When we approach our relationships with a positive attitude, we are more likely to be empathetic and understanding. We are more likely to listen to others and offer support when needed. For example, when one of my close friends was going through a tough time, I made sure to be there for her. I listened to her concerns and offered words of encouragement. We talked for hours, and I could tell that she felt better after our conversation. Our friendship has only grown stronger since then, and I am grateful for the positive impact I have had on her life.

Finally, having a positive attitude can also have a significant impact on our overall health. When we approach life with a positive attitude, we are more likely to take care of our physical and mental health. We are more likely to exercise regularly, eat healthy, and get enough sleep. We are also less likely to experience stress and anxiety, which can lead to a range of health problems. For example, when I was struggling with anxiety, I started practicing meditation and yoga. I found that these practices helped me to reduce my stress levels and improve my overall well-being. I feel more energized and focused now, and I am grateful for",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As human beings, we all face pressures from those around us, especially our families. It's especially difficult when those around us don't necessarily share our vision for reaching our personal dreams. Family pressure can be difficult to overcome, but it's important to stay true to ourselves and trust our own judgement rather than change for others.

Throughout history, there have been many inspiring stories of people who chose to stand up for themselves and follow their dreams in the face of peer or familial pressure. Whether it was giving up a high-paying job to pursue a creative passion or risking serious cultural disapproval to stay single and pursue their own independence, people have been able to show the importance of standing up for yourself and pursuing your passions. 

It's important to recognize that breaking free from external pressures is necessary for growth and reaching our personal dreams. We can learn from the inspiring stories of others who have done just that. The lesson here is to trust ourselves and be willing to take risks. Pursuing our dreams is often not easy, but staying true to ourselves and making sure to take care of our better interests is essential. We must remember that nobody else can determine our paths – only we can make that decision.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about whether it's better to graduate early or take the normal four-year route. I'll give you the pros and cons of each and then decide which one is better. 🤔

First, let's talk about the pros of graduating early. One big pro is that you get to start college earlier! 🎉 That means you can get a head start on your degree and maybe even finish it faster. Plus, you'll have more time to focus on your passions and interests outside of school. 🎭 You can start working on your dreams early, instead of waiting until after high school. 💡

Another pro of graduating early is that it can be less stressful. 😩 Think about it, you don't have to take as many classes or deal with as much homework in the same amount of time. You can take a lighter load and focus on your own personal growth. 🌱 It's like a breath of fresh air! 🌲

One con is that you might miss out on some important experiences. 🤔 Like, you might not have as much time to hang out with your friends or participate in extracurricular activities. You might also miss out on some important social interactions that can help you grow as a person. 🤝 It's like, you're giving up some of your teenage years to get ahead in life. 😔

Another con of graduating early is that it can be challenging. 💪 You'll have to take extra classes to catch up on the material you missed, and it can be hard to keep up with the workload. It's like, you're trying to drink from a firehose! 💧 You might also struggle to adjust to college life, especially if you're not used to being around older students. 😅

"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student!  Today, we're gonna talk about this cool quote by Michelangelo: ""The greatest danger for a sculptor is not to practice his art."" I think it's pretty relatable to setting goals in modern society.

So, setting easy goals can be beneficial 'cause it helps us feel accomplished and motivated. Like, if I want to learn how to play the guitar, starting with easy songs and gradually increasing the difficulty can help me build my confidence and keep me from getting frustrated. Plus, knowing my limits means I won't bite off more than I can chew and end up feeling like a failure.

But, let's say I set a goal to learn how to play the guitar like a pro in a week. That's just gonna be frustrating, ya know? I'll be like, ""Why can't I do this?! I'm trying so hard!"" And then I'll get discouraged and give up.  It's like, setting unrealistic goals can make us feel like we're not good enough, even if we're actually putting in effort.

On the other hand, setting hard goals can lead to great accomplishments! Like, if I set a goal to get straight A's in school, it might be challenging, but it'll also motivate me to study harder and do my best. And if I achieve it, I'll feel super proud of myself!  But, if I set a goal that's too hard, it can be discouraging when I don't reach it, and I might give up altogether.

So, setting easy goals can inspire us to aspire to greater heights! Like, if I start by learning how to play simple songs on the guitar, maybe I'll get hooked and want to keep practicing and improve my skills. And who knows, maybe one day I'll be playing at a concert!  It's all about starting small and working your way up.

"As an eighth-grade student, I have come to understand the importance of staying active and never idling in life. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to be idle ... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote highlights the value of being constantly active and avoiding idle time. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of staying busy and how much can be accomplished by being always doing.

Firstly, staying active helps individuals to achieve their goals and aspirations. When we are constantly working towards something, we are more likely to make progress and achieve our desired outcomes. For example, if a student wants to get good grades, they need to study regularly and complete assignments on time. By staying active and working hard, they can achieve their goal of getting good grades. Similarly, if an individual wants to become a successful entrepreneur, they need to work hard, network, and take calculated risks. By staying busy and actively working towards their goal, they can increase their chances of success.

Secondly, staying active helps individuals to develop new skills and knowledge. When we are constantly learning and growing, we become more knowledgeable and skilled. For instance, if a person wants to learn a new language, they need to practice speaking and listening regularly. By staying active and practicing, they can improve their language skills and become more proficient. Similarly, if someone wants to learn a new hobby, they need to practice and experiment with different techniques. By staying busy and actively learning, they can develop new skills and interests.

Thirdly, staying active helps individuals to stay healthy and happy. When we are constantly engaged in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel happy and satisfied with our lives. For example, if a person enjoys exercising, they are more likely to feel energized and healthy. Similarly, if someone enjoys spending time with friends and family, they are more likely to feel happy and fulfilled. By staying active and engaging in activities that bring us joy, we can improve our mental and physical health.

In conclusion, staying active and never idling in life is crucial for achieving our goals, developing new skills and knowledge, and staying healthy and happy.

"After researching the potential impact of shortening the duration of public high school from four years to three, it is clear that there could be both advantages and disadvantages of such a change. On the positive side, a three-year program could give students the opportunity to enter college or the workforce one year earlier than those in a four-year program, allowing them to fast-track their educational or career pursuits. However, it could also alienate those who would have otherwise benefitted from an additional year of high school, such as those looking to improve their academic scores or those needing an extra year to acclimate to the pre-university or employment environment.

Ultimately, the decision to pursue three years of high school should take into account several other factors. These could include students’ academic readiness levels, the availability of extracurriculars and support services, and the larger socio-economic environment that will affect a student’s educational and career prospects. Based on these considerations, it is clear that every individual must evaluate the risks and benefits of a three-year high school program against their own personal circumstances, and the potential impact of the decision on their future success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Graduating high school in three years instead of four has become a more popular option for many students; however, this can be associated with several drawbacks. For those taking this path, the fast-tracked schedule means having less time for family activities, elective classes that are outside of general academic subjects, and college preparation activities such as SAT and ACT prep as well as college admissions visits. Moreover, the intensified workload can also result in greater stress for those attending school in three years rather than four.

Despite the potential drawbacks, remaining in school for four years can have considerable advantages. Having an extra year of high school allows more time to hone academic interests, thus increasing college readiness. It also allows students to take more elective courses, partake in extracurricular activities, and take part in college preparation activities such as test prep and college visits. Graduating after four years of high school also gives students more time to appreciate their high school experience and make lifelong memories.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Title: My Dream Career: Becoming a Software Engineer

As an 8th grader, I'm constantly thinking about my future career path. I've always been fascinated by technology and coding, and I know that software engineering is a field that offers a lot of opportunities for growth and success. In this essay, I'll share my research on what it's like to be a software engineer, how much they make, and the advice I've received from my parents, older siblings, and counselors.

First, let's talk about the job itself. Software engineers design, develop, and test software programs for a wide range of applications, from video games to mobile apps to operating systems. They work with a team of developers to identify user needs and turn them into functional software products. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for software engineers is around $110,000, which is way higher than the national average for all occupations. That's definitely a good reason to consider this career path!

I've also talked to people who have already pursued a career in software engineering. My older brother, who works as a software engineer at a tech company, told me that his job involves a lot of problem-solving and critical thinking. He said that he loves the challenge of finding creative solutions to complex problems, and that he's constantly learning new things. He also mentioned that the job can be demanding at times, but the sense of fulfillment he gets from creating something that people use every day is worth it.

My parents have also given me some valuable advice when it comes to pursuing a career in software engineering. They told me that it's important to have a strong foundation in math and computer science, and to keep practicing my coding skills. They also reminded me that it's okay to make mistakes and to learn from them. They said that failure is a normal part of the learning process, and that it's important to be resilient and persistent.

In addition to talking to my brother and parents, I've also done some research at the library. I read a book called ""Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach"" by Roger S. Pressman, which gave me a deeper understanding of the field",1,llama2_chat,0
"Attitude is often described as “the lens through which we view the world.” Indeed, having a positive attitude can significantly improve our daily lives, from the way we approach the workplace to the way we handle relationships. It is no wonder that so many prominent figures throughout history have highlighted the importance of developing a positive outlook—including Benjamin Franklin, who famously said, “The Constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.” 

What makes a positive attitude the key to success is its role in personal motivation. For example, a study from the University of Michigan showed that students with a positive attitude about taking a tough math course achieved better results than students with negative attitudes, regardless of their level of intelligence or King’s College London tested the effect of “positive thinking” on athletes and found that successfully imagining the act of completing a task can increase motivation.

In our professional and personal lives, having a positive attitude can open the doors of opportunity. This is because positive thinking leads to optimism, which can improve quality of work, thus making us more appealing to employers or allowing us to achieve our goals. 

Positive attitude is undoubtedly a key to success. With resilience and conviction, any individual can develop the necessary skills and knowledge to become successful, but it is the attitude that makes them shine. A positive attitude can show employers and colleagues the state of our mental health and resilience towards challenges, making it easier for us to take the steps towards a brighter future.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Oh boy, I am so excited to write about Brazil! 😍 I mean, who doesn't love a country that's home to beautiful beaches, vibrant culture, and delicious food?! 🌮🏖️🎉 As an 8th grader, I've always been fascinated by Brazil and its unique blend of indigenous, African, and European influences. So, let's dive right in and explore some of the amazing experiences, foods, and activities that Brazil has to offer! 🌟

First of all, let's talk about the food! 🍔🌮🥤 Brazilian cuisine is a fusion of different cultures, and it's absolutely delicious! Have you tried feijoada? It's a traditional Brazilian dish made with black beans, beef, and pork. It's so good! 🤤 And don't even get me started on the desserts – pão de queijo (cheese bread) is a must-try! 🍰👌

But food isn't the only thing Brazil is known for! 🎉 Brazil is home to some of the most incredible parades and festivals in the world. Carnival is one of the most famous, with colorful costumes, music, and dancing that will leave you breathless. 💃🏽🕺🏻 And have you heard of the Rio Carnival? 🤯 It's like nothing you've ever seen before – thousands of people dancing and partying in the streets! 🎉

And let's not forget about the language! 🇧🇷 Portuguese is the official language of Brazil, and learning a few basic phrases can go a long way. 📚 ""Olá"" (hello), ""obrigado"" (thank you), and ""desculpe"" (excuse me) are some common phrases you might want to learn. 😉

"The introduction of a four-day work week has the potential to have a positive impact on a variety of economic, environmental, and social elements. For employers, there could be a reduction in overhead costs due to fewer hours worked each week, resulting in a more budget-friendly labor force. Additionally, employees could benefit from increased job satisfaction and more flexible hours, allowing them to better manage their home and work lives. In terms of environmental conservation, a four-day work week could result in a significant decrease in energy and fuel consumption, as well as a reduction in air pollution. Finally, a shorter work week could make a positive social impact on workers, as studies have found that a four-day work week could lead to improved mental and physical health, greater productivity, and increased overall well-being.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Studies have shown that enforcing curfews for teenagers can help reduce the likelihood of them getting into trouble. Curfews can help to keep young people in a safe environment and help to provide structure in their lives. In addition, research has also found that curfews can provide parents with peace of mind, knowing that their children are safe.

There are also activities and resources that teenagers can participate in that will help to keep them out of trouble. Examples of these include sports, community volunteering, after-school programs, and even mentoring schemes which can provide young people with an outlet for their emotions and involvement in constructive activities. These resources can help to divert teenagers’ attention away from criminal activities that could lead to trouble.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Good morning! Today, I'm going to talk about the different attitudes people display in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, people tend to be more relaxed and laid back. They usually wake up later and take their time getting ready for the day. They might spend time reading the news, having breakfast, or just lounging around the house. People in the morning are usually less stressed and more focused on enjoying their free time before the day starts.

On the other hand, in the afternoon, people tend to be more stressed and rushed. They usually wake up earlier and have a more structured routine. They might have to get ready for work or school, pack their bags, and rush out the door. People in the afternoon are usually more focused on getting things done and being on time.

One example of someone displaying a good attitude in the morning is my grandma. She wakes up early, but she takes her time getting ready. She enjoys having breakfast with her husband and reading the newspaper. She's not stressed or rushed, and she's able to enjoy her morning before the day starts.

On the other hand, one example of someone displaying a bad attitude in the afternoon is my neighbor. He wakes up early and rushes out the door without having breakfast. He's always in a hurry and seems stressed out. He's always late for work and complains about it.

In conclusion, people's attitudes in the morning and afternoon are different due to the different tasks they have to do. In the morning, people tend to be more relaxed and laid back, while in the afternoon, they tend to be more stressed and rushed. By understanding these differences, we can learn to manage our time better and improve our attitudes.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Technology has become a pervasive part of our lives in the 21st century. It is used in every aspect of our daily lives from communication to education, business, entertainment, and more. This technology can have both positive and negative impacts on people's lives. 

On the positive side, technology facilitates research, education, and communication. For instance, the internet allows individuals to easily access an abundance of information to further their knowledge. It also allows people to communicate more easily, and cheaply, with people all around the world. Additionally, many aspects of business, like banking and marketing, have been aided immensely by new technologies. 

On the other hand, technology can also have negative effects on people's lives. It can create severe health issues, such as eye strain or carpal tunnel syndrome, due to a lack of physical activity and too much time spent on devices. Furthermore, technology can be addicting, leading to social isolation and can disrupt sleep. Additionally, cybercrime is a growing concern, as online scams, identity theft, and ransomware pose threats to personal safety and data security. 

Overall, technology has changed our lives significantly, both for the better and for the worse. Its positive and negative impacts can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on how it is used. No matter what, it is important to recognize both the positive and negative aspects of technology when incorporating it into our lives to ensure a healthy, balanced lifestyle.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey there!  So, for this essay, we gotta research and write about whether students should be forced to participate in extracurricular activities. Like, I know some people might be like, ""Yaaas, totes yes!"" and others might be like, ""Ugh, no way, it's so lame!"" So, I'm gonna give my thoughts on the issue.

First off, let's talk about the pros of mandatory extracurriculars. Some people say that it's important for students to have a balance in their lives, you know? Like, school is super important, but so is having fun and doing stuff that makes you happy. Extracurriculars can help you find your passion and make new friends who share your interests. Plus, they look good on college apps, so it's like, a win-win.

But, on the other hand, some people think it's not fair to force kids to do stuff they don't want to do. Like, what if a student doesn't like sports or music? They should have the right to choose what they want to do with their time, you know? And, let's be real, sometimes extracurriculars can be super time-consuming and stressful. If you're already feeling overwhelmed with school work and stuff, adding in more activities can be, like, totally draining.

So, in my opinion, I think it's important for students to have the option to participate in extracurriculars, but it shouldn't be mandatory. Like, if a student wants to join a club or sport, that's great, but they shouldn't have to do it if they don't want to. It's all about balance and finding what works for each individual student.

In conclusion, mandatory extracurriculars can be beneficial, but it's important to consider the opinions of students and find a balance that works for everyone.  So, what do you think? Do you think students should be forced to participate in extracurriculars, or should it be optional? Let me know in the comments! 😃",1,llama2_chat,0
"One of the biggest issues to be considered when changing the summer break to June and August and eliminating spring break is the effect on students and teachers. For students, this means that they would lose out on a week off that they usually look forward to. The loss of spring break could lead to higher levels of stress and frustration, especially among those who have been looking forward to vacations or time off from school work. Teachers could be put under increased pressure as they would have to ensure that students meet their year-long educational goals without the extra week in the spring. 

To try and make up for the lost spring break, schools could introduce activities that simulate a break in the middle of the year. One idea could be a week of fun activities that take place at the end of the school year, with events like organized trips, workshops, and games. Another solution would be for schools to offer extended summer breaks, where students could take a longer break in between June and August. This could help to make up for the lost spring break and enable students to have time off from their studies.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"The prospect of implementing a four-day school week with ten hour days has merits and drawbacks that must be considered. From a student attendance perspective, this schedule could lead to increased absenteeism as students may need to juggle family matters on their long days off, such as childcare. Furthermore, this model could prove overly taxing on students, leading to increased stress levels. On the other hand, an extended school day could enable students to benefit from a more robust curriculum, with longer periods for more complex concepts. Additionally, this approach might be an attractive option for students who have part-time jobs or extracurricular commitments, as they would have longer days off.

Overall, while a four-day school week with ten hour days may have some benefits, they should be balanced with its drawbacks. It is important to remember that while increased flexibility may be a positive aspect, students must be able to cope with the extended days and additional academic demands. Furthermore, students should be encouraged to use their days off to help manage their stress levels, attend to necessary tasks, and engage in activities that promote mental and physical well-being.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"The road to success is full of obstacles and self-doubt, but the key to success is never giving up. It is important to stay focused on your goals and never stop working relentlessly towards them. Everyone's path to success is unique, and people need to be prepared to face any hardships they may be confronted with along the way. Even when faced with difficulties, it's important to keep going and push harder to reach the destination. 

Having a solid plan and strategy to work towards a goal is crucial. It's not enough to just dream about being successful, you have to actually follow through with your plans and make sure that you're consistently moving forward. This could mean taking small steps each day towards the ultimate goal, while also making sure to take time to reflect on what has been achieved thus far. Success will come with patience and dedication, and it's important to never forget that. 

Success requires hard work, unwavering motivation, and dedication. It's important to stay focused on the end goal and never give up, no matter how difficult the journey may become. It is only by staying persistent and resilient along the way that true success can be achieved.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Attending classes from home, also known as online learning, has been a popular option for students in recent years. While it offers several benefits, such as flexibility and convenience, it also has its drawbacks. As an 8th grader, I believe that attending classes from home can be both advantageous and disadvantageous to students.

On the one hand, online learning provides students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace. This can be particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who live far away from school. For instance, a student who has to work part-time to support their family may find it difficult to attend classes during regular school hours. With online learning, they can complete their coursework at any time and at their own pace, which can help them manage their responsibilities better. Additionally, online learning can provide students with access to a wider range of courses and resources, as they can take classes from other schools or institutions.

On the other hand, attending classes from home can also have some drawbacks. For instance, students may find it difficult to stay motivated and focused without the structure and social interaction of a traditional classroom. Without the presence of a teacher and peers, students may struggle to stay on track and may miss out on important learning opportunities. Moreover, online learning can lack the personalized attention and feedback that students receive in a traditional classroom. This can make it harder for students to understand complex concepts and to improve their performance.

Another concern is that some students may take advantage of the flexibility offered by online learning. For example, they may complete their coursework quickly and then spend the rest of the day watching TV or playing video games, rather than actively engaging with the material. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a lower quality of learning. Furthermore, online learning can create a sense of isolation, as students may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers. This can negatively impact their social and emotional development.

In conclusion, while attending classes from home can offer some benefits, such as flexibility and access to a wider range of courses, it also has its drawbacks. Students may struggle to stay motivated and focused, and some may take advantage of the flexibility offered by online learning. To mitigate these drawbacks, it is important for schools",1,llama2_chat,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that attending classes at school has its own set of benefits that cannot be replicated by taking classes online. While online classes have their own advantages, they cannot replace the social and academic benefits that come with attending school in person.

One of the main benefits of attending classes at school is the social interaction that comes with it. School provides a platform for students to interact with their peers and teachers on a daily basis. This social interaction helps students to develop important social skills such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. Additionally, attending school in person allows for more personal interactions with teachers, which can lead to better academic performance and a stronger relationship with the teacher.

Another benefit of attending school in person is the structure and routine that comes with it. School provides a consistent schedule and routine that helps students to stay organized and focused on their studies. This structure can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with time management or who require more accountability in their studies.

On the other hand, taking classes online has its own set of benefits. One of the main advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially beneficial for students who have other commitments such as jobs or family responsibilities. Additionally, online classes often offer a wider range of courses and programs than traditional schools, which can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing less common or specialized areas of study.

However, if everyone took classes online, schools would have fewer students. This would have a significant impact on the resources and funding available to schools. Schools rely on the revenue generated from tuition and other fees to fund their operations, including facilities, staffing, and other resources. If schools had fewer students, they would have less revenue, which could lead to cuts in funding and resources.

Furthermore, schools play a critical role in the development of young people. They provide a safe and structured environment for students to learn, grow, and develop important life skills. If everyone took classes online, students would miss out on the social and academic benefits that come with attending school in person.

In conclusion, while online classes have their own set of benefits, they cannot replace the social and academic benefits that come with attending school in person. Schools provide a platform for social interaction, structure, and routine that is essential",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

"Extending school one and a half hours each day has potential benefits of providing students with more opportunities for success. It could enable longer class sessions, allowing for more in-depth subject material to be taught, as well as more time for extra-curricular activities or for additional help from teachers and staff. Furthermore, this could result in improved student engagement, better academic performance and higher graduation rates. 

At the same time, extending school each day could lead to fatigue and stress for both students and staff. There is also a potential for significant increases in operational costs for teachers, administrators, and support staff. 

Despite potential drawbacks, longer school days could lead to more productive and meaningful learning, as more time could be devoted to reading, laboratory experiments, field trips, or project based learning. It could also provide more opportunities for physical activity, as students would have more time for sports and extracurricular activities, and potentially introduce students to more diverse activities. 

Extending school one and a half hours each day could also help motivate students by providing a sense of purpose and helping them stay focused by providing predictable and organized routines. This could also give students the opportunity to develop better time management skills, as they would have additional time to plan and prepare for their studies and activities. 

The research findings indicate that extending school one and a half hours each day has the potential to have positive impacts on student learning and to motivate students to strive for greater success. Yet, there are also potential drawbacks that need to be taken into account. All factors should be assessed and weighed carefully before implementing longer school days.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey there!  For this essay, I had to research different types of personality traits and how they can shape our personalities. I mean, who doesn't want to know more about themselves, right? 😅

So, I started by looking up different types of personality traits like extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and so on. I found out that each trait has its own set of characteristics and behaviors that define it. For example, extraverts are outgoing and social, while introverts are more reserved and independent. Agreeable people are easy to get along with, while conscientious folks are organized and responsible.

Next, I asked my friends and family what type of character trait they think I possess. Some said I'm pretty outgoing and social, while others said I'm more reserved and independent. It was interesting to see how different people can have different perspectives on my personality! 🤔

After that, I utilized online resources to learn more about character traits and how they can affect our personalities. I found out that our personality traits can influence how we behave in different social situations and how we interact with others. For instance, if you're an extravert, you might do better in a group setting than someone who's more introverted.

Now, I had to reflect on my own behavior in different social situations and try to figure out which personality type best fits me. I realized that I'm actually a mix of different traits, but I tend to lean more towards being an introvert. I'm not super outgoing or social like some people, but I'm also not super reserved or independent like others. I guess you could say I'm more of a mix-and-match kind of personality! 😅

Lastly, I thought about ways I could strengthen the traits that I already have. I realized that I could work on being more outgoing and social in certain situations, like when I'm around new people or in group settings. I could also try to be more organized and responsible, like a conscientious person, to help me stay on top of my tasks and goals.

"Collaboration, team-work, and being considerate of others are essential components of success in various contexts. Whether it is in the workplace, family, school, or social relationships, these qualities can greatly impact the outcomes we achieve. In this essay, I will explore how collaboration, team-work, and being considerate of others can shape success in different contexts.

Firstly, collaboration is crucial in the workplace. In today's fast-paced business environment, companies are constantly seeking ways to improve productivity and efficiency. Collaboration allows employees to share ideas, resources, and expertise, which can lead to innovative solutions and increased efficiency. For example, a software development team may collaborate to design and develop a new application, which can be successful in the market. Collaboration can also help to build trust and foster a positive work environment, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and employee retention.

Secondly, team-work is essential in family and school settings. Families and schools rely on teamwork to achieve common goals, such as raising children and educating students. In families, parents work together to provide for their children's needs, such as food, shelter, and education. In schools, teachers and staff work together to provide a quality education for students. Teamwork can also help to build strong relationships and foster a sense of community. For example, a school team may work together to organize a fundraiser for a specific cause, which can bring the community together and raise awareness for the cause.

Thirdly, being considerate of others is crucial in all aspects of life. Being considerate of others means taking into account their needs, feelings, and perspectives. This can lead to better relationships, increased empathy, and a sense of compassion. For example, in a workplace, being considerate of others can lead to better communication, increased trust, and a more positive work environment. In family settings, being considerate of others can lead to better relationships, increased understanding, and a sense of unity. In school settings, being considerate of others can lead to better relationships, increased empathy, and a sense of community.

These qualities can greatly impact the outcomes we achieve in the workplace, family, school, and social relationships. By working together, sharing",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I have been considering my future career path and the education required to achieve it. My dream is to become a game designer, and I have been researching the college courses available to study this career.

One of the most common college courses for game design is a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Game Design. This program typically includes courses in game theory, game programming, game art, and game animation. Other related programs include a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science with a focus on game development or a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Game Studies.

Having a college education can greatly help me achieve a successful career in game design. A college education provides me with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in the field. I will learn about game theory and design, programming languages, and art and animation techniques. Additionally, a college education can provide me with valuable networking opportunities and connections in the industry.

Furthermore, having a college degree can improve my job prospects and salary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for game developers is $105,270. This is significantly higher than the median annual wage for individuals with a high school diploma. Additionally, many game design jobs require a college degree, so having one can give me a competitive edge in the job market.

As an eighth-grade student, I understand the importance of setting a positive example for my family members and children. A college education can demonstrate to them that hard work and dedication can lead to success. Additionally, it can show them that education is valuable and can provide opportunities for personal and professional growth.

Finally, I must consider the consequences of not completing a college education despite having the opportunity. While it may be possible to succeed in game design without a college degree, it may limit my job prospects and potential salary. Additionally, it may not provide me with the same level of knowledge and skills as a college education.

In conclusion, I believe that completing a college education is crucial for achieving a successful career in game design. A college education provides me with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in the field, improves my job prospects and salary, sets a positive example for my family members and children, and can provide valuable networking opportunities and connections in the industry.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"First impressions can have a lasting impact, and in many instances they are almost impossible to change. This is because we tend to use first impressions as benchmarks in forming an opinion about someone or something. As a result, first impressions can shape our future interactions and experiences with them. 

To illustrate the effects of first impressions, I’ll use an example from my own life. As a freshman in high school, I was excited to join the basketball team. Upon entering the gym for the team’s first practice, I was surprised to find that I already had a negative reputation among some of my teammates. At first, I couldn’t understand why they were so skeptical about me, but then I realized that my reputation was based on a poor first impression. Unbeknownst to me, my teammates had already judged me based on my physical appearance and the fact that I was new to the team. Despite the fact that I worked extremely hard to gain their trust and admiration, I found that it was a losing battle due to my poor first impression. 

These experiences have taught me that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Despite our best efforts, those who make an unimpressive first impression often find that subsequent efforts to shake the initial perception are simply not enough. As a result, first impressions can have a lasting impact and it’s important to make a good one when you meet someone for the first time.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

Staying true to oneself and persevering despite setbacks is super important. Like, really important. I mean, think about it. If you're true to yourself, you're not gonna be like, you know, a total fake or anything. And if you persevere, you're gonna be way more successful in the long run.

First of all, staying true to yourself means being honest and authentic. You're not gonna be trying to be someone you're not, which is totally exhausting. And it's also way more fun to be yourself, 'cause you can be like, ""Hey, I'm just being real here!"" And people are gonna be like, ""Yeah, that's so cool!""

But persevering is also really important. Like, when things get tough, you're not gonna give up. You're gonna keep going, even when it's hard. And that's when the real growth happens. Like, if you're in a math class and you're struggling with fractions, you're not gonna be like, ""Oh, I give up."" You're gonna keep practicing and stuff, and eventually you're gonna get it. And then you're gonna be like, ""Whoa, I'm so glad I didn't give up!""

So, like, staying true to yourself and persevering despite setbacks is basically the key to success. It's like, the more you're true to yourself and keep going, the more you're gonna achieve your goals. And it's way more fun that way too. You're not gonna be like, ""Ugh, I'm so tired of being me."" You're gonna be like, ""Yessss, I'm so glad I didn't give up!""

"Supreme and Gucci are two of the most well-known and successful clothing brands in the world. Both companies have a rich history and have made significant contributions to the fashion industry. In this essay, I will explore the history of Supreme and Gucci, as well as the benefits of working in a Supreme store and the value and resell potential of Supreme store items.

Supreme is a New York-based streetwear brand that was founded in 1994 by Shawn Stussy. The brand began as a small skateboard shop in Los Angeles, California, and quickly gained popularity among skaters and surfers. In 1996, Stussy sold the brand to James Wu and Josh Katz, who expanded the brand's product line to include clothing, accessories, and collaborations with other brands. Today, Supreme is known for its iconic logo, which features the word ""Supreme"" in a bold, sans-serif font, and its collaborations with other brands, such as Louis Vuitton and Nike.

Gucci, on the other hand, is an Italian luxury brand that was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci. The brand began as a leather goods company in Florence, Italy, and quickly expanded to include clothing, shoes, and accessories. In the 1950s and 1960s, Gucci became synonymous with the ""jet set"" lifestyle, and its iconic interlocking GG logo became a symbol of wealth and luxury. Today, Gucci is one of the largest and most successful fashion brands in the world, with a global presence and a wide range of products.

Both Supreme and Gucci have made significant contributions to the fashion industry, and both brands have a strong following among fashion enthusiasts. However, there are some key differences between the two brands. Supreme is known for its streetwear aesthetic and its collaborations with other brands, while Gucci is known for its luxury and its iconic interlocking GG logo.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the topic ""Why the length of summer break should not be reduced"" as an 8th grade student:

Summer break is one of the most anticipated times of the year for students. It's a time to relax, have fun, and recharge for the next school year. However, some people think that the three-month summer break is too long and that it negatively impacts students' academic performance. While I understand their concerns, I strongly believe that the length of summer break should not be reduced.

Firstly, summer break is crucial for students' mental health. The academic year can be incredibly stressful, with long hours of school, homework, and exams. Reducing the summer break would mean adding more stress to students' lives, which could lead to burnout and decreased motivation. Students need time to unwind and recharge during the summer break, which helps them come back to school refreshed and ready to learn.

Secondly, summer break provides students with opportunities to explore their interests and passions outside of school. Many students use the summer break to participate in sports, music, or art camps, or to volunteer in their communities. These experiences help students develop their skills and interests, which can benefit them in the long run. Reducing the summer break would mean taking away these opportunities for students to explore and grow.

Thirdly, summer break allows students to spend quality time with their families and friends. The summer break is a time for families to travel, go on vacations, or simply spend time together. Reducing the summer break would mean taking away this precious time with loved ones, which can have a negative impact on students' emotional well-being.

Finally, reducing the summer break would not necessarily improve academic performance. While some people argue that a shorter summer break would allow students to focus more on their studies, I believe that this is not the case. Students need time to relax and recharge during the summer break to perform their best in school. Additionally, reducing the summer break would mean packing more schoolwork into a shorter period of time, which could lead to increased stress and decreased motivation.

In conclusion, while I understand the concerns about the length of summer break, I strongly believe that",1,llama2_chat,4
"In Thomas Jefferson's words, ""Never be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" These words evoke an idea that is still relevant in society today - the importance of not being idle. With a global pandemic having affected much of our everyday life, it is more important than ever for young people to stay busy and productive.

Through Jefferson's words, young people are not only inspired to make use of their free time constructively but also strive to help others. With the current state of the world, we can come together by taking action to combat destructive idling. This could look like volunteering in local food banks, finding creative ways to engage with friends and family online, or even taking up a new hobby. No matter how big or small the contributions are, we can all do our part to not be idle.

Ultimately, Jefferson's words help us recognize the importance of not being idle and how it can both challenge and motivate us to strive to better our society. By using our time wisely, we can all come together and make a difference for future generations.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"High school is a crucial part of a person's life, as it prepares them for the future. One of the biggest decisions that high school students make is whether to finish in three or four years. While some people believe that finishing high school in three years is better, others argue that four years is the way to go. In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of finishing high school in three years versus four years.

Finishing high school in three years has several advantages. First and foremost, it allows students to get a head start on their future. By finishing high school early, students can start college or pursue other post-secondary opportunities sooner. This can be especially beneficial for those who plan to attend college right out of high school, as they can begin their studies in the fall of their senior year.

Additionally, finishing high school in three years can also save students money. Tuition and fees for college can be expensive, and by finishing high school early, students can potentially save thousands of dollars in tuition costs. This can be a significant advantage for students who are trying to make the most of their financial resources.

However, there are also some disadvantages to finishing high school in three years. One of the biggest concerns is that students may not be fully prepared for the challenges of college or the workforce. High school is designed to provide a well-rounded education, and by finishing early, students may not have had enough time to fully develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in college or their chosen field.

Another potential disadvantage of finishing high school in three years is that it may limit students' options. Some colleges and universities may not accept students who have not completed their full four years of high school, which could limit the number of opportunities available to them. Additionally, some employers may view students who have not completed high school as less qualified than those who have.

On the other hand, finishing high school in four years has its own set of advantages. One of the biggest advantages is that it allows students to have a more traditional high school experience. High school is designed to provide a well-rounded education, and by finishing in four years, students can have the opportunity to participate in all of the activities and programs that high school has to offer.

Additionally, finishing high school in four years can also provide students with more time to explore their interests and",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey there!  So, for this essay, we gotta analyze and evaluate Ralph Waldo Emerson's opinion on growing by trying something beyond what we've mastered. 

In my opinion, Emerson is totally right!  If we don't challenge ourselves, we'll never know our true potential.  Like, think about it. If we only eat the same old food every day, we'll never discover new flavors or nutrients.  And if we stick to the same old hairstyle or clothes, we'll never know how we look in different styles or colors. 

But,  I don't know if I totally agree with Emerson on the part about short people.  I mean, I'm pretty short myself, and I don't think it's a bad thing!  I mean, short people can be just as confident and awesome as tall people.  Like, have you seen those tiny little kids who are like, ""I'm not gonna let my height hold me back!""  They're like, mini-role models! 

But,  yeah, eating healthy and trying new things can really make a difference.  It's like, our bodies are like plants, and we gotta give 'em the right nutrients to grow.  And if we don't try new things, we'll never know what we're missing out on.  Like, I've been meaning to try sushi for ages, but I've never had the chance. 

Anyway,  in conclusion, Emerson's opinion is totally valid, but I think we should also consider the perspective of short people.  And yeah, eating healthy and trying new things is important.  So, let's all make an effort to do that!  And who knows, maybe we'll discover new",1,llama2_chat,2
"It is becoming increasingly popular for high school students to complete high school in three years, instead of the traditional four-year model. There are many advantages to this accelerated approach, such as being able to take classes before and after school in order to cover the content more quickly, and the ability to forego taking elective courses in order to focus on core courses. Finishing high school in three years can also better prepare students for college, as they may be able to take college classes as early as the end of their junior year. 

However, there are some drawbacks to finishing high school in three years. Students may find themselves feeling increased fatigue from coming early and staying late in order to be able to complete the required courses. Additionally, students may be missing out on important developmental experiences which can come from taking elective classes and socializing with peers during lunch and other in-school activities. Before deciding to take on the challenge of finishing high school in three years, students should consider the pros and cons carefully.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Title: The Power of Praise and Achievements on Student Confidence

As an 8th grader, I have learned that praise and achievements play a significant role in shaping a student's self-esteem and confidence. When we receive praise and accomplish things, it boosts our self-esteem and makes us feel good about ourselves. In this essay, I will explain how both contribute to the development of a student's confidence.

Firstly, praise is essential in building a student's self-esteem. When we receive praise from teachers, peers, or parents, it makes us feel appreciated and valued. It lets us know that our efforts are recognized and appreciated, which in turn boosts our confidence. For instance, if I receive an A on a test, my parents will praise me for my hard work, and it makes me feel proud of myself. This feeling of pride and appreciation motivates me to work harder and strive for better grades in the future.

Secondly, achievements are also crucial in developing a student's confidence. When we achieve something, whether it's academic or extracurricular, it gives us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. It makes us feel like we are capable of achieving our goals and that our efforts are paying off. For example, if I make the school soccer team, it gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment, and it boosts my confidence in my abilities.

Moreover, both praise and achievements help students develop a growth mindset. When we receive praise and achieve things, it encourages us to take risks and push ourselves beyond our limits. It makes us believe that we can accomplish anything we set our minds to, and that our efforts will be rewarded. This mindset helps us to embrace challenges and view them as opportunities for growth and learning.

In conclusion, praise and achievements are crucial in developing a student's confidence. When we receive praise and accomplish things, it boosts our self-esteem and motivates us to work harder. Both contribute to the development of a student's confidence by giving us a sense of pride, appreciation, and accomplishment. Therefore, it is essential for teachers, peers, and parents to recognize and encourage students'",1,llama2_chat,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that the American government has a responsibility to provide services to its citizens in order to reduce poverty and inequality. In this essay, I will discuss some potential solutions to accomplish these goals and analyze their potential impact on the American population.

One way that the government can reduce poverty is by increasing funding for social programs. Social programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, and housing assistance can provide essential resources to low-income families, helping them to meet their basic needs. Additionally, the government can also increase funding for education, which can provide opportunities for individuals to improve their economic situation and reduce poverty in the long term.

Another solution that the government can implement is to increase the minimum wage. By raising the minimum wage, low-wage workers will be able to earn more money, which can help to reduce poverty. However, it is important to note that increasing the minimum wage can also have negative consequences, such as increased costs for businesses and potentially higher prices for consumers.

The government can also implement policies to reduce income inequality. For example, progressive taxation, where higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, can help to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality. Additionally, the government can also implement policies to promote equal pay for equal work, such as requiring businesses to pay their employees the same wage for the same job regardless of gender or race.

It is important to note that while these solutions may have the potential to reduce poverty and inequality, they are not a silver bullet. Poverty and inequality are complex issues that require a multi-faceted approach. Additionally, it is important for the government to consider the potential impact of these solutions on the American population, and to ensure that they are implemented in a way that is fair and equitable for all.

In conclusion, the American government has a responsibility to provide services to its citizens in order to reduce poverty and inequality. While there are many potential solutions to accomplish these goals, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of these solutions on the American population. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Knowledge and imagination are two vital components of human existence. While imagination allows us to explore the uncharted territories of our minds and envision possibilities beyond our current reality, knowledge provides us with the foundation upon which we build our understanding of the world. In this essay, I will argue that knowledge is more important than imagination, and provide evidence to support this claim.

Firstly, knowledge is the basis for informed decision-making. Imagination, on the other hand, is the ability to envision potential outcomes and possibilities. While imagination is important for creativity and innovation, it is not enough to make informed decisions. For example, a person may imagine a scenario where a certain action will lead to a desirable outcome, but without the knowledge of the potential consequences of that action, the decision may not be the best one. In contrast, a person with knowledge of the potential outcomes of an action can make an informed decision that takes into account both the benefits and risks.

Secondly, knowledge provides a framework for understanding the world around us. Imagination allows us to envision possibilities beyond our current reality, but it does not provide a framework for understanding those possibilities. Knowledge, on the other hand, provides us with a foundation upon which we can build our understanding of the world. For example, a person with knowledge of biology can understand how the human body works, and how different actions and behaviors can affect it. Without this knowledge, a person may imagine a scenario where a certain action will lead to a desired outcome, but without understanding the underlying biology, the decision may not be the best one.

Finally, knowledge is essential for progress and advancement. Imagination allows us to envision possibilities beyond our current reality, but it is not enough to turn those possibilities into reality. Knowledge is required to understand the principles and concepts necessary to turn those possibilities into reality. For example, a person with knowledge of physics can understand how to build a bridge or a car, while a person without that knowledge may imagine a scenario where they can build a bridge or a car, but without the necessary knowledge, the dream may never become a reality.

In conclusion, while imagination is important for creativity and innovation, knowledge is more important for informed decision-making, understanding the world around us, and progress and advancement. Knowledge provides us with the foundation upon which we build our understanding of the world, and without it,",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked you're asking me to write an essay on this super important topic! 😃

So, you know, making important life decisions is like, a big deal. Like, it can totally change your life and stuff. And there are two ways to go about it: doing it yourself or getting advice from experts and authorities. And I'm here to tell you my thoughts on which one is better. 🤔

First of all, let's talk about making decisions independently. I mean, it's like, you get to do what you think is best for you without anyone else telling you what to do. It's like, totally empowering and stuff. And sometimes, you might come up with better ideas than someone else would. Like, if you're trying to decide where to go for spring break, you might know that some place that's not on everyone else's radar is actually the best spot. 🏖️

But, on the other hand, seeking advice from experts and authorities can be super helpful too. Like, they've got way more experience and knowledge than you do, so they can give you super valuable insights. And sometimes, they might see things from a different perspective that you wouldn't have thought of. Like, if you're trying to decide on a college major, a career counselor can help you figure out what's the best fit for you based on your interests and skills. 🎓

So, it's like, really hard to choose between the two. But, I think it's important to do both. Like, you should totally do your own research and think critically about what you want, but also don't be afraid to ask for help from people who know more than you do. It's like, a balance thing. 🤝

In conclusion, making important life decisions is like, a big deal, and there are pros and cons to both doing it yourself and seeking advice from experts and authorities. But, like, it's important to be open-minded and consider both perspectives. Thanks for reading my essay! 📚",1,llama2_chat,3

"Technology has become an integral part of our lives in recent years. From smartphones to smart homes, it has transformed the way we live, work, and interact with others. While there are many benefits to technology, there are also some negative effects that we cannot ignore.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is the way it has revolutionized communication. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, we can now connect with people from all over the world in real-time. This has made it easier for us to maintain relationships with friends and family, as well as to collaborate with others in the workplace.

Another benefit of technology is the way it has made our lives more convenient. With smartphones and other mobile devices, we can access information and services from anywhere, at any time. This has made it easier for us to shop, bank, and even get medical care.

However, there are also some negative effects of technology that we cannot ignore. One of the biggest concerns is the impact of technology on our mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media and other digital devices can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. This is because technology can create a false sense of connection, making us feel like we are constantly comparing ourselves to others and feeling inadequate.

Another negative effect of technology is the way it has changed our attention spans. With so much information available at our fingertips, it can be difficult to focus on one task for an extended period of time. This can lead to decreased productivity and a lack of focus in our daily lives.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on our lives. While there are many benefits to using technology, there are also some negative effects that we cannot ignore. It is important for us to be aware of these effects and to use technology in a responsible and balanced way. By doing so, we can maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its negative effects on our lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Character Traits: Are They Chosen or Formed?

As an 8th grader, I have often wondered whether the character traits we possess are chosen by us or formed by influences beyond our control. This is a complex question that has been debated by philosophers and scientists for centuries. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument and present my own opinion.

On one hand, some people believe that our character traits are chosen by us. According to this view, we have the power to decide what kind of person we want to be and what values we want to uphold. For example, if we want to be kind and compassionate, we can choose to actively practice these traits in our daily lives. Similarly, if we want to be brave and adventurous, we can choose to take risks and step out of our comfort zones. This perspective suggests that our character traits are like muscles that can be strengthened with practice and effort.

On the other hand, there are those who argue that our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. This view suggests that our upbringing, environment, and genetics play a significant role in shaping our personality and behavior. For instance, if we were raised in a family that values punctuality, we may be more likely to develop a strong sense of time management. Similarly, if we grew up in a culture that values extroversion, we may be more likely to be outgoing and sociable. This perspective implies that our character traits are like a puzzle, with many pieces that are already in place before we are even born.

Personally, I believe that both perspectives have some validity. While it is certainly possible to choose to develop certain character traits, I also think that our upbringing and environment can play a significant role in shaping who we are. For example, I come from a family that values education, and as a result, I have always been motivated to do well in school. However, I also recognize that I have a tendency to be introverted, which may be influenced by my genetic makeup.

In conclusion, the question of whether we choose our character traits or if they are formed by influences beyond our control is a complex and multifac",1,llama2_chat,0
"In today's world, many people have gone against the odds and achieved success. These individuals have shown that with hard work, determination, and perseverance, anything is possible. However, failure is also a common experience in life. It is important to understand the causes of failure and how it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to strive for success.

One of the main causes of failure is a lack of motivation. Without a clear goal or reason to work towards, individuals may lose interest and give up. In order to avoid this, it is important to set high goals and have a strong desire to achieve them. This will help keep individuals motivated and focused on their end goal.

Another cause of failure is a lack of planning or preparation. Without a solid plan or strategy in place, individuals may not be able to effectively reach their goals. In order to avoid this, it is important to do research, create a plan, and take action. This will help individuals stay on track and make progress towards their goals.

In addition to these causes, failure can also be a learning experience. By learning from our mistakes, we can gain valuable insights and knowledge that can help us improve and grow. It is important to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as a setback.

Ultimately, aiming high and working to achieve one's goals is the best course of action in order to maximize success. By setting high goals and working hard to achieve them, individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve great things. It may not always be easy, but the rewards are worth it.

In conclusion, there are many examples of people who have gone against the odds and achieved success. Failure is a common experience in life, but it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to strive for success.

So, the pros of finishing high school in three years are pretty cool. First of all, you get to start college earlier! Can you imagine being able to take college classes while you're still in high school? It's like getting a head start on your education. Plus, you'll have more time to focus on your passions and interests outside of school. Like, I'm really into photography, and if I finished high school early, I could take more time to develop my skills and maybe even start a business.

Another pro is that you'll have more time to travel and explore the world. I've always wanted to visit Europe, but my parents are like, ""Sorry, kiddo, you gotta finish high school first."" But if I could finish early, I could go on a road trip with my friends and see all the cool places we've been learning about in history class. 🚗🏜️

Now, there are some cons to finishing high school in three years too. One of them is that you might miss out on some important social experiences. Like, you might not have time to join any sports teams or clubs, and you'll definitely miss out on prom and other events. Plus, you might feel like you're missing out on your friends' experiences since you'll be in school less.

1. Benefits of Having a Good Attitude

Having a positive attitude can bring numerous benefits to our lives. Firstly, it can improve our mental health, as it reduces stress and anxiety levels. It can also help us to stay motivated and focused, which can lead to better academic performance and overall success. Additionally, having a positive attitude can improve our relationships with others, as it makes us more approachable and empathetic. Finally, having a positive attitude can help us to find opportunities and overcome obstacles, which can lead to personal growth and development.

2. Strategies for Maintaining a Positive Attitude

Maintaining a positive attitude can be challenging, especially during difficult times. However, there are several strategies that can help us to stay positive. Firstly, we can practice gratitude by focusing on the good things in our lives. This can be as simple as taking a few moments each day to reflect on what we are thankful for. Additionally, we can surround ourselves with positive people who can provide support and encouragement. It can also be helpful to engage in activities that bring us joy and fulfillment, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones.

3. How Positive Vibes Can Help You to be Successful

Having a positive attitude can play a crucial role in achieving success, especially during challenging periods. When we have a positive attitude, we are more likely to approach obstacles with optimism and resilience. This can help us to find solutions and overcome setbacks more easily. Additionally, having a positive attitude can help us to stay motivated and focused, which can lead to better academic performance and overall success.

"Failure: The Unspoken Path to Success

As an 8th grader, I've learned that failure is not something to be feared, but rather embraced. It's a crucial stepping stone on the path to success. Without failure, we wouldn't learn how to pick ourselves up and keep going. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" Failure is not the opposite of success, but rather a part of the process.

One of the most important reasons why enthusiasm is necessary for success is that it keeps us motivated. When we're passionate about something, we're more likely to put in the hard work and effort required to achieve our goals. For example, professional athletes don't become pros by sitting on the couch and wishing they could play basketball. They put in countless hours of practice and training, even when they're not feeling motivated.

Another reason why enthusiasm is important is that it helps us learn from our mistakes. When we're excited about something, we're more likely to take risks and try new things. And when we fail, we can use those experiences to improve and try again. For instance, if I'm trying to learn how to play the guitar, I might not get it right the first time. But if I'm enthusiastic about playing, I'll keep practicing until I get it right.

Enthusiasm also helps us stay focused and determined. When we're passionate about something, we're more likely to push through the tough times and keep going. For example, if I'm working on a science project, I might get frustrated when I don't get the results I want. But if I'm enthusiastic about the project, I'll keep trying until I get it right.

In conclusion, failure is not something to be feared, but rather embraced. It's a necessary part of the process of achieving success. And enthusiasm is essential for success because it keeps us motivated, helps us learn from our mistakes, and keeps us focused and determined. So the next",1,llama2_chat,4
"In life, there are many things that we strive to master, whether it be a new language, a musical instrument, or a sport. Once we have achieved mastery in something, it can be tempting to give up and move on to the next challenge. However, I believe that people should not give up even when they feel they have been mastered in something. In this essay, I will argue why people should continue to pursue their passions and interests, even after they have achieved mastery, using examples to support my argument.

First, it is important to understand that mastery is not the end of the journey, but rather the beginning of a new one. When we achieve mastery in something, we unlock a whole new world of possibilities and opportunities. For example, when I first learned to play the guitar, I was content to just strum along to my favorite songs. However, as I continued to practice and improve, I began to explore new genres of music and even started to write my own songs. This newfound creativity and passion for music has opened up many doors for me, both personally and professionally.

Second, giving up on something we have mastered can lead to a sense of stagnation and boredom. When we continue to challenge ourselves and push ourselves to improve, we are constantly learning and growing. This sense of accomplishment and progress can be incredibly motivating and fulfilling. For example, when I was in high school, I was a member of the debate team. After my freshman year, I felt like I had mastered the basics of public speaking and debate. However, I was wrong. My coach encouraged me to continue to practice and improve, and I ended up competing in nationals and even winning the championship. The sense of accomplishment and growth I experienced during that time was unparalleled.

Finally, giving up on something we have mastered can lead to a loss of motivation and drive. When we set goals for ourselves and work hard to achieve them, we develop a sense of purpose and direction. This sense of purpose can be incredibly powerful in motivating us to continue to pursue our passions and interests. For example, when I was in college, I was a member of the track team. After my sophomore year, I felt like I had mastered the basics of running and was content to just run for fun. However, my coach",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey, Mrs. Smith! Here's my essay on the advantages of attending regular classes versus online classes. I hope you like it! 😊

So, you know how there are these new-fangled online classes that everyone's been talking about? Like, how they're super convenient and stuff? Well, I think there are some major advantages to attending regular classes instead. Like, for real. 🤔

First of all, regular classes are way better for learning about other cultures. I mean, when you're in a classroom with other people, you can actually see and hear each other, right? You can ask questions and get answers, and you can learn so much more than just from a computer screen. Plus, you can actually practice speaking and listening to different languages, which is super important if you want to be able to communicate with people from other cultures. Online classes just can't compete with that. 🌎

Another thing I think is really cool about regular classes is how they help you gain confidence when interacting with people. Like, when you're in a classroom, you have to speak up and participate, right? You can't just sit there and hide behind your computer screen. And the more you practice, the more confident you'll become. Plus, you'll learn how to communicate with people in a way that's respectful and considerate of their feelings. That's super important in today's world. 💪

Finally, regular classes are way better for getting involved in activities. I mean, when you're in a classroom, you can see what's going on around you, right? You can join clubs and groups and participate in events, and you can make new friends who share your interests. Online classes just don't have the same vibe. Plus, when you're in a classroom, you can actually see the excitement and enthusiasm of your classmates, and it's way more contagious than just seeing a computer screen. 🎉

So, there you have it! Those are my thoughts on why regular classes are better than online classes. I hope you found them helpful, Mrs. Smith. 😊 Let me know if you have any questions",1,llama2_chat,0
"Ugh, do I really have to?  Fine. Here's my essay on why the city council should adopt a curfew for teenagers.

So, like, you know how teenagers are always out late at night, causing trouble and stuff? It's like, really annoying and stuff. And it's not just me, right? Like, my parents are always stressing about how late I'm out and how it's not good for me. And they're not even exaggerating. I mean, think about it. Teenagers are like, super impressionable and stuff. We're still figuring out who we are and stuff, and being out late at night can really mess with our heads. Plus, it's not safe. Like, have you seen some of the things that happen at night? It's not worth the risk.

And it's not just the safety thing. Like, think about how much more productive we could be if we didn't have to worry about being out late. I mean, I know I'm not the only one who's been up late studying for a test or working on a project, but if there was a curfew, I could focus more on my schoolwork and stuff. And it's not just schoolwork. Like, think about how much more time we could spend on our hobbies and interests if we didn't have to worry about being out late. I know I'd love to spend more time playing video games or reading books if I didn't have to worry about being grounded for being out late.

And it's not just us. Like, think about how it would benefit the whole community. If teenagers were home earlier, we could be more involved in our communities and stuff. We could volunteer more, or help out with local events, or even just be more aware of what's going on around us. And it's not just that. Like, think about how it would help with the whole crime thing. If teenagers were home earlier, we wouldn't be out causing trouble and getting into trouble with the law. It's just common sense, you know?

So, yeah. That's my argument for why the city council should adopt a curfew for te",1,llama2_chat,2
"Ummm... hey there!  So, the topic we got for this essay is...  writing and organizing work.  I know, I know, it's like, super important and all that jazz, but like, I'm not really sure where to start. 

Okay, so, let's see... ideas related to writing and organizing work.  Well, like, first things first, we gotta brainstorm some ideas.  Hmmm... how about... 

1. Keeping track of progress!  Like, it's so easy to lose track of what you've done and what you still need to do.  So, it's important to make a plan and keep track of your progress. 
2. Organizing your workspace!  I know, I know, it's not the most glamorous thing in the world, but trust me, it makes a big difference.  Like, having a designated space for your work can help you stay focused and avoid distractions. 
3. Using different colors and symbols!  Like, I know this might sound silly, but like, using different colors and symbols can help you stay organized and remember things better.  Like, if you use red for important things and green for less important things, it's easier to find what you need quickly. 
4. Breaking down big tasks into smaller ones!  Oh my gosh, this is like, so important!  Like, when you have a big project to work on, it can be overwhelming and stressful.  But, if you break it down into smaller tasks, it's easier to manage and you can see progress. 
5. Taking breaks!  Oh yeah, like, it's important to take breaks too!  Like, working on something for too long can make it hard to focus and be productive.",1,llama2_chat,1
"Character is a major presence in our lives, as it affects every aspect of how we interact with the world, how we interact with ourselves, and how we view ourselves. The question of how we choose and shape our characters often comes up: whether it is through shaping our own character traits or through the influences of others. 

On one hand, it could be argued that character traits are primarily shaped by our experiences and environment. From the moment we are born and begin to interact with the world, we are constantly presented with new opportunities to shape our character that are dependent on the individuals and influences we come into contact with. In this way, it could be said that character is built up through external factors that contain a certain amount of influence on our development. 

On the other hand, it is important to recognize the critical role that we play in the process of forming our character. Our decisions, our actions, and our goals all serve to shape our character. From making choices that align with our values to deliberately seeking out new experiences and perspectives, our ability to choose our character traits is a powerful part of the journey to achieving our true selves. Whether we are aware of it or not, our choices in life reflect aspects of our characters and serve to shape our behavior in many ways. 

Ultimately, it is clear that character building is a complex interplay between the influences that come from our environment, our experiences, and our own decisions. At the end of the day, our character is ultimately our responsibility, and it is within our power to shape it. We must take the necessary steps to build up the traits that we need in order to thrive in life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"School days are already long and that is why the school board should not add an extra one and a half hours to each one. Not only are students already overworked, but longer school days could have an overall negative effect on their wellbeing. 

Firstly, students have their own lives outside of school. Longer school days would give them less time to relax or pursue their own personal interests. This could lead to burnout and cause them to resent their studies even more than they may already. 

Secondly, an increase in the amount of time spent at school would reduce the amount of physical activities students are able to participate in. Mental and physical health are both important, and longer days could lead to students developing an unbalanced lifestyle, which could potentially have serious consequences.

Lastly, having longer school days would lead to an increase in the amount of homework assigned. Teachers would end up assigning more so that students can keep up with the contents covered in school, but this would further overburden students and leave less time for family and personal leisure time. 

In conclusion, the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day. Not only would it be detrimental to students’ mental and physical health, but it would also reduce the amount of free time they have to do other activities, leading to an overall decrease in their quality of life. It is essential that students have adequate time to pursue activities that they enjoy and relax.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I have witnessed the impact of technology on people's lives, and I believe that technology has the potential to have a positive effect on people, especially in regards to physical health, reading, and decision-making. In this essay, I will explore how technology can have a positive effect on people and discuss the factors that can help individuals evaluate their choices.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is its impact on physical health. With the rise of wearable devices and health apps, individuals can track their fitness and monitor their health more accurately than ever before. For instance, I use a fitness tracker on my wrist to monitor my daily steps, heart rate, and calories burned. This information helps me make better choices about my diet and exercise routine, which has led to an improvement in my overall health. Additionally, technology has made it easier for individuals to access medical information and connect with healthcare providers, which can lead to better health outcomes.

Another way technology can positively impact people is through reading. With the rise of e-books and audiobooks, individuals can access a vast library of books at their fingertips. This has made it easier for me to read books that I may not have had access to before. Additionally, technology has made it possible for individuals to read books on the go, which has led to an increase in reading habits. This has not only improved my knowledge and vocabulary but has also helped me develop a love for reading.

Finally, technology can positively impact decision-making. With the rise of data analytics and machine learning, individuals can make better decisions based on data and information. For instance, when choosing a college, I used data analytics to research different universities and compare their costs, programs, and location. This information helped me make an informed decision about which university to attend. Additionally, technology has made it easier for individuals to collaborate and make decisions together. For example, when planning a group project, we used project management software to assign tasks and track progress, which helped us make decisions more efficiently.

In conclusion, technology has the potential to positively impact people in various ways, including physical health, reading, and decision-making. Individuals may be faced with making difficult decisions, but there are several factors that can help them evaluate their choices. These factors include access to information, collaboration tools, and data analytics. As technology continues to",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey there! 🌞

As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to share my thoughts on the cool activities you can do outside! 🌳🏖️

First off, let's talk about going to the community park. It's like, my fave place to hang out with my friends! We can play frisbee, soccer, or just chill on the benches. It's so much fun running around and getting some exercise. Plus, it's free! 💰

Next up, I love training a dog! 🐶🐾 I think it's so cool how they can learn tricks and stuff. My sibling has a dog, and I help take care of it sometimes. It's like, a big responsibility, but it's also really fun. I wanna get a dog when I'm older! 🐾🏠

Oh, and have you heard of ""dog beaches""? 🐕🏖️ They're like, special places where dogs can run around and play without any leashes! My family went to one last summer, and it was so much fun! My dog was able to run around and play with other dogs, and I got to relax on the beach. It was like, the best day ever! 🌞🐶

Another thing I like to do outside is clear my mind. 🧘‍♀️ It's so easy to get stressed out these days, you know? But going for a walk or doing some yoga outside can really help. The fresh air and nature are like, super calming. I feel so much better after doing it! 🌱🧘‍♀️

Lastly, I think it's really important to find someone to connect with. 🤝 Whether it's a friend, family member, or even a stranger, it's great to have someone to talk to and share experiences with. I love making new friends, and I find that it's easier to do outside. Like, at the beach or park, people are more open and friendly. It's like, a big ol' party!",1,llama2_chat,3
"In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. From smartphones to computers and smart homes, we rely on technology to connect with others, access information, and even perform basic tasks. However, despite the many benefits of technology, it also has negative impacts on society and the new generations.

One of the most significant negative impacts of technology is the loss of opportunities for interaction with other people. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, people are increasingly relying on digital communication rather than face-to-face interactions. While this can be convenient, it can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. People may miss out on the social skills and emotional intelligence that come from interacting with others in person.

Another negative impact of technology is the risk posed by scams and viruses on personal information. With the increasing amount of personal information being shared online, people are more vulnerable to identity theft and other forms of cybercrime. This can have serious consequences, including financial loss and damage to one's reputation.

Finally, technology has made people become lazier. With the ability to automate many tasks and perform them from the comfort of one's own home, people are increasingly relying on technology to do the work for them. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a lack of physical activity, which can have negative impacts on one's health and well-being.

In conclusion, while technology has brought many benefits to society, it also has negative impacts that cannot be ignored. It is important for individuals to be aware of these impacts and take steps to mitigate them. This may include limiting screen time, being cautious when sharing personal information online, and taking steps to stay active and engaged with others in person. By doing so, we can ensure that technology continues to be a positive force in our lives and the lives of future generations.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Imagination and knowledge are two essential aspects of life that help us make informed decisions. However, while knowledge is crucial, imagination can be equally beneficial in certain situations. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of imagination over knowledge in making life decisions.

Firstly, imagination can help us choose the right thing to do. When faced with a difficult decision, knowledge can be overwhelming, and it can be challenging to weigh all the pros and cons. On the other hand, imagination can provide us with a clearer picture of the situation, allowing us to make a more informed decision. For example, when deciding on a career path, imagination can help us visualize ourselves in different roles and industries, allowing us to choose the one that aligns with our passions and interests.

Secondly, knowledge can create a lot of pressure. When we have a lot of knowledge about a particular topic, it can be challenging to make a decision, as we are constantly weighing the pros and cons. This pressure can lead to indecision, which can be detrimental in certain situations. For example, when deciding on a college major, knowledge about different fields of study can be overwhelming, leading to indecision and a lack of direction. In contrast, imagination can provide us with a clearer picture of our goals and aspirations, allowing us to make a decision with confidence.

Thirdly, knowledge can affect the future. While knowledge is essential for success, it can also limit our potential. When we have too much knowledge about a particular subject, we can become too focused on the details and lose sight of the big picture. This can limit our ability to think creatively and innovatively, which can be detrimental in certain situations. For example, when starting a business, knowledge about the industry can be helpful, but too much knowledge can limit our ability to think outside the box and come up with new and innovative ideas. In contrast, imagination can provide us with the ability to think creatively and innovatively, allowing us to succeed in the future.

Finally, imagination can help us succeed in college. College is a time of transition, and it can be challenging to navigate the complexities of higher education. When faced with new challenges, knowledge can be overwhelming, leading to indecision and a lack of direction. However, imagination can provide us with the ability to think creatively and innovatively, allowing us to succeed in",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I have been attending school for almost ten hours a day, five days a week. However, some schools have proposed adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to the school day. While some people believe that this would be beneficial, others argue that it would be detrimental. In this essay, I will be discussing the pros and cons of a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer.

On the one hand, having a longer school day could have several advantages. Firstly, it would allow for more time for students to learn and absorb new information. With an extra hour and thirty minutes, teachers could provide more in-depth lessons and activities that would help students better understand the material. Additionally, students could have more time to work on homework and assignments, which would improve their grades and overall academic performance.

Furthermore, a longer school day could also provide more opportunities for extracurricular activities. Many students are interested in participating in sports, music, and other clubs, but they often struggle to find time to balance their academic and extracurricular responsibilities. With an extra hour and thirty minutes, students could have more time to participate in these activities and develop new skills and interests.

On the other hand, a longer school day could also have several disadvantages. Firstly, it could lead to increased stress and burnout for students. With more time in school, students would have to endure more lessons, lectures, and assignments, which could be overwhelming and exhausting. Additionally, students may struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance, as they would have to spend more time in school and less time on other activities outside of school.

Furthermore, a longer school day could also lead to a decrease in the quality of education. With more time in school, teachers may become overwhelmed and struggle to provide effective and engaging lessons. Additionally, students may become disengaged and disinterested in learning, as they may feel that the school day is too long and uninteresting.

In conclusion, a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer could have both advantages and disadvantages. While it could provide more time for learning, homework, and extracurricular activities, it could also lead to increased stress and burnout for students and a decrease in the quality of education.

As an eighth-grade student, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. From using it to read books, watch TV shows, and shop, technology has revolutionized the way we interact with the world. However, it is essential to understand the positive and negative effects of using technology.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is its ability to provide instant access to information. With a few clicks, we can read books, watch TV shows, and shop online. Technology has also made it easier for students to access educational materials and collaborate with their peers. However, it is essential to be mindful of the time spent on technology and ensure it does not negatively impact our mental health.

Technology has also made it easier for scammers to target elderly people. Scammers use technology to send fraudulent emails, make fake phone calls, and create fake websites to trick people into giving away their personal information. It is crucial to be cautious and verify the authenticity of any requests for personal information before providing it.

In conclusion, technology can be used for both positive and negative purposes. It has revolutionized the way we access information and has made it easier for students to collaborate and learn. However, it is essential to be mindful of the time spent on technology and ensure it does not negatively impact our mental health. Additionally, we must be cautious of scammers who use technology to target elderly people. By being aware of the positive and negative effects of technology, we can ensure it is used for positive purposes only.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"In his statement, Albert Schweitzer argues that ""example is the only thing in influencing others."" While this statement holds true in many cases, it is not a requirement for influencing people. In fact, individuals can be influenced by various other sources, such as television, the internet, or simply by other people's ideas. 

For example, when a person views an influential figure and is inspired by her ideals, she may start to emulate the characteristics that make that person successful. That doesn't necessarily mean she has had direct contact with the individual, and yet she is still being influenced. 

In addition, people can be influenced by the media without direct contact. From seeing inspiring and powerful messages in television commercials to reading motivating articles on the internet, people are often moved by the messages they ingest without ever knowing the source. 

Therefore, while direct example certainly has its place as a powerful tool for influence, it is not the only one and certainly not the only way to affect the behavior of others. With the myriad of possible influences available to people, direct example is just one small piece of the puzzle.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a five-day school week is more beneficial than a four-day school week. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of having a five-day school week and provide an example of how it allows students to manage their time more efficiently. I will also describe the potential drawbacks of adopting a four-day school week.

Firstly, having a five-day school week allows students to have a more structured schedule. This structure provides students with a routine that they can follow, which helps them manage their time more efficiently. For example, students can use their free time to go to a job after school or participate in extracurricular activities. Additionally, having more time for homework allows students to complete their assignments more thoroughly and efficiently. This is especially important for students who have a heavy workload or who struggle with time management.

Furthermore, having a five-day school week allows students to have more time for physical activity. This is important for students' overall health and well-being. Physical activity can help reduce stress, improve mood, and increase energy levels. For example, students can participate in sports or other physical activities after school or during their free time.

On the other hand, adopting a four-day school week could have potential drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is the extended school day leading to fatigue. Students may feel overwhelmed and exhausted after a long school day, which could negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being. Additionally, a four-day school week could lead to a lack of structure and routine for students. This could make it difficult for students to manage their time effectively and could lead to procrastination and other negative behaviors.

In conclusion, I believe that having a five-day school week is more beneficial than a four-day school week. A five-day school week provides students with a structured schedule, more time for physical activity, and allows students to manage their time more efficiently. While a four-day school week could have potential benefits, such as reducing stress and increasing work-life balance, it could also have potential drawbacks, such as the extended school day leading to fatigue and a lack of structure. Overall, I believe that a five-day school week is the best option for students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"The Benefits of Spending Time Outdoors and Enjoyable Activities

Spending time outdoors has numerous benefits for both our mental and physical health. It provides a break from the daily routine of sitting inside and being glued to screens, and allows us to engage in activities that promote exercise, relaxation, and socialization. In this essay, we will explore some of the benefits of spending time outdoors and discuss three enjoyable activities that can be enjoyed outside.

First, spending time outdoors has been shown to reduce stress and improve mood. Being surrounded by nature, fresh air, and sunlight can have a calming effect on the mind and body. It can also increase the production of endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Additionally, spending time outdoors can improve cognitive function and creativity, as exposure to natural environments has been linked to increased creativity and problem-solving skills.

One enjoyable activity that can be enjoyed outdoors is playing catch. It's a simple and fun activity that can be done with friends or family. It's also a great way to get exercise, as it involves running, jumping, and throwing. Playing catch can be done in a park, on a field, or even in a backyard. It's a great way to bond with others and have fun in the sun.

Another enjoyable activity that can be enjoyed outdoors is riding a bike. Biking is a great form of exercise that can be done alone or with friends. It's also a great way to explore new places and see sights that you might not be able to see while driving. Biking can be done on a variety of surfaces, including pavement, trails, and even gravel roads. It's a great way to get some fresh air and exercise while having fun.

Finally, playing football is another enjoyable activity that can be enjoyed outdoors. It's a great way to get exercise, as it involves running, kicking, and tackling. It's also a great way to bond with others and have fun in a team setting. Football can be played on a variety of surfaces, including grass, turf, and even sand. It's a great way to have fun and stay active.

"As a student, I believe that having the freedom of action and thought is essential in a world that constantly tries to impose conformity. In today's society, people are often pressured to fit into certain roles and expectations, which can lead to a lack of individuality and personal growth. However, by embracing our own unique perspectives and taking action to pursue our goals, we can unlock our full potential and lead fulfilling lives.

One of the most significant benefits of having the freedom of action and thought is the ability to be ourselves. In a world that values conformity, it can be easy to feel like we need to fit into certain roles or follow certain rules in order to be accepted. But by embracing our own unique perspectives and taking action to pursue our goals, we can show the world that we are capable of achieving great things on our own terms.

For example, consider the story of Steve Jobs. Jobs was known for his unconventional approach to business and his willingness to take risks. He was not afraid to think outside the box and pursue his own vision, which ultimately led to the success of Apple. If Jobs had conformed to the expectations of others and followed a more traditional path, he may never have achieved the level of success that he did.

Another benefit of having the freedom of action and thought is the ability to pursue our own personal growth. When we are free to think and act as we see fit, we are able to explore new ideas and challenge ourselves to grow in new ways. This can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and a deeper understanding of our own values and beliefs.

For example, consider the story of Malala Yousafzai. Yousafzai was a young girl who spoke out against the Taliban's restrictions on education in Pakistan. Despite facing death threats and other dangers, she continued to advocate for the rights of girls to receive an education. Yousafzai's bravery and determination to pursue her own values and beliefs inspired millions of people around the world and helped to bring attention to the issue of education inequality.

"Online classes provide a unique set of advantages compared to traditional classroom learning. One major benefit of taking courses online is the extra time it gives students to finish their work. Online classes don't have fixed meeting times, so students can fit their studies in with their other commitments. This can be especially helpful for working students, who may otherwise not have as much time to dedicate to learning. Additionally, since online classes don't require attending in person, students can save time by not having to get up and go to class on certain days. Furthermore, students of online courses can also enjoy the comfort of sleeping in more often. 

College-level courses are taking place online more and more, showing the potential of this type of learning. Online classes for college credit often provide the same material that can be offered in traditional classrooms, but with a flexible schedule that fits more easily around the lives of the students who take them. In addition to allowing students to better manage their workload, taking online courses for college credit can also increase access to more classes, as universities have been able to continue their operations during the COVID-19 pandemic by switching to an online format. 

In summary, online classes offer a variety of benefits beyond traditional classroom learning. Through such benefits as saving time, having a more flexible schedule, and increasing access to classes, they are a great option for students who are looking to make the most of their learning experience. With the increasing availability of online courses for college credit, there is much to be gained from taking classes using this mode of instruction.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this thing where some schools are thinking about letting students graduate in three years instead of four. Like, I know it might seem cool to get out of school early and start your life, but honestly, I think it's a bad idea.

So, first of all, think about how much stress it would be on students. I mean, we're already trying to balance schoolwork, sports, and hanging out with friends. If we had to cram all that into three years instead of four, it would be crazy! We wouldn't have enough time to do anything, let alone relax and have fun. And let's be real, who wants to be stressed out all the time? Not me, that's for sure!

And then there's the fact that we wouldn't have time for elective classes. Like, I really want to learn how to play the guitar, but we only have like, an hour a week to do it. If we graduated early, we wouldn't have that extra time to explore our interests and figure out what we really want to do with our lives. It's important to have time to explore and try new things, you know?

And what about college preparation? I mean, we're supposed to be getting ready for college, but if we graduate early, we'd have less time to take the SATs, apply to colleges, and all that stuff. It would be super stressful and confusing, and I don't think we'd be as prepared as we need to be.

So, yeah, I think it's better to stick with the traditional four-year graduation plan. It might be longer, but it's worth it in the end. We get more time to relax, explore our interests, and prepare for college. Plus, it's just more fun that way!

That's my opinion, anyway. What do you guys think? Do you think three-year graduation is a good idea, or do you think we should stick with the traditional plan? Let me know in the comments! 😃",1,llama2_chat,3
"Graduating early can be a great opportunity to jumpstart one's dream job or start college earlier. Completing a four-year program in a shorter period of time is a testament to a student's dedication, ambition, and discipline. Financially, graduating early can mean saving money on tuition and room and board fees, as well as less money spent on textbooks and other supplies. 

At the same time, graduating early can be more difficult in terms of academic rigor and personal challenge. Not only does it require taking extra classes, but it also requires more intense studying time and a more disciplined approach to course selection. It can also lead to a feeling of academic burnout earlier than normal. 

When weighing the pros and cons of graduating early, it is important for each individual to take into account their own academic and financial situation, as well as their own feelings of academic burnout. Ultimately, each student should decide whether graduating early is the appropriate decision for them. Graduating early does not necessarily guarantee a better education than the standard four-year plan; rather, each student should choose the path that best meets their individual needs and goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Graduating from high school in three years instead of four can be beneficial for certain high school students, but it is not without its drawbacks. For instance, district high schools offer special programs to help students accelerate their coursework and graduate early. However, some students who have graduated early via these programs struggle with college studies because they have not had the same level of instruction or time to adjust to a college learning environment as their four-year-graduating peers. 

An increasingly popular option for some students is to graduate three years by taking online classes or night school. While these solutions can save time and money, there are drawbacks to consider. For instance, the online courses may be more difficult than regular classes and the night school may prove to be a challenge with a busy schedule. Furthermore, it is unclear if the credits earned during these courses will be accepted in four-year colleges and universities, and the level of instruction received in these settings may not fully prepare students for college-level academics. 

Ultimately, the decision to graduate early should be an informed one. Students should consider all the available options and research, in detail, the potential benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, the success or failure of graduation early will depend on the level of personal dedication and the kind of support the student has.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Aiming high in life is a concept that has been ingrained in many of us from a young age. We are taught to strive for the best and to never settle for anything less. However, this idea is not without its flaws. While aiming high can lead to great success, it can also lead to feelings of failure and disappointment. On the other hand, aiming low can lead to a sense of satisfaction and contentment, but it can also limit our potential.

Firstly, aiming high can lead to great success. When we set high goals for ourselves, we are more likely to put in the effort and hard work required to achieve them. This can lead to a sense of accomplishment and pride. Additionally, when we achieve our goals, we are more likely to feel confident in our abilities and to continue striving for even greater things.

However, aiming high can also lead to feelings of failure and disappointment. When we set high goals for ourselves, we are more likely to experience setbacks and obstacles. This can be discouraging and can lead to feelings of frustration and hopelessness. Additionally, when we do not achieve our goals, we may feel as though we have failed and that we are not capable of achieving anything.

On the other hand, aiming low can lead to a sense of satisfaction and contentment. When we set low goals for ourselves, we are more likely to achieve them. This can lead to a sense of accomplishment and pride. Additionally, when we achieve our goals, we may feel as though we have done enough and that we do not need to strive for anything more.

However, aiming low can also limit our potential. When we set low goals for ourselves, we are not challenging ourselves to reach our full potential. This can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and a lack of purpose in life. Additionally, when we do not strive for greatness, we may miss out on opportunities for personal growth and development.

In conclusion, both aiming high and aiming low have their pros and cons. Aiming high can lead to great success, but it can also lead to feelings of failure and disappointment. Aiming low can lead to a sense of satisfaction and contentment, but it can also limit our potential. Ult",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that being true to oneself is one of the most important aspects of life. In a world that is constantly trying to make us something else, it is essential to hold onto our unique identities and not let anyone else define us.

One of the main themes that come to mind when thinking about this topic is individuality. It is crucial to be true to ourselves and not try to fit into someone else's mold. We all have our own unique talents, interests, and personalities, and we should embrace them and not try to hide them. By being ourselves, we can be happy and fulfilled, and we can also inspire others to be true to themselves.

Another theme that comes to mind is self-esteem. When we are true to ourselves, we feel confident and proud of who we are. On the other hand, when we try to be someone else, we may feel insecure and unsure of ourselves. By embracing our unique identities, we can build our self-esteem and feel good about ourselves.

However, being ourselves can also have consequences. For example, we may face criticism or rejection from others who do not accept us for who we are. It can be difficult to deal with this, but it is important to remember that our opinions and values should not be swayed by the opinions of others. We should stand up for what we believe in and not let anyone else define us.

In conclusion, being true to oneself is essential in a world that is constantly trying to make us something else. By embracing our unique identities, we can be happy, fulfilled, and confident. While it may have consequences, it is important to stand up for what we believe in and not let anyone else define us. As the great poet Maya Angelou once said, ""You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated."" By being ourselves, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve our goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that students should not be required to take music, drama, or art classes and that these should be electives. While some may argue that these subjects are essential for a well-rounded education, I believe that they can often be pointless, unfair, and not important to take in order to provide evidence for my argument.

Firstly, it is important to note that not all students have the same interests or talents. Some students may excel in music, drama, or art, while others may not. Forcing all students to take these classes regardless of their interests or abilities can be seen as unfair. It is important to give students the freedom to choose the subjects they want to pursue, as it allows them to focus on their strengths and passions.

Secondly, it is important to consider the time and resources that are allocated to these subjects. In many schools, music, drama, and art classes take up valuable time that could be used for more important subjects such as math, science, and language arts. Furthermore, these subjects often require specialized equipment and materials, which can be costly. By making these subjects electives, schools can allocate more resources to subjects that are more important for students' academic success.

Finally, it is important to consider the practicality of these subjects in the real world. While some may argue that these subjects are essential for developing creativity and critical thinking skills, the reality is that many people in the workforce do not use these skills on a daily basis. In fact, some jobs may even require a lack of these skills. By making these subjects electives, students can choose to focus on subjects that are more relevant to their future careers.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that students should not be required to take music, drama, or art classes and that these should be electives. By giving students the freedom to choose the subjects they want to pursue, schools can allocate more resources to subjects that are more important for students' academic success, and students can focus on subjects that are more relevant to their future careers. It is important to consider the practicality of these subjects in the real world and to give students the opportunity to pursue their interests and passions.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, is a prime example of how a determined work ethic can lead to great achievements. Throughout his life, Jefferson demonstrated a relentless dedication to his work, whether it was as a writer, lawyer, architect, or politician. His accomplishments, including the Declaration of Independence and the design of the University of Virginia, can be attributed to his strong work ethic and determination to succeed.

Jefferson believed that hard work was essential for success, and he put this belief into practice every day. In a letter to his friend John Adams, he wrote, ""I am not an advocate for frequent changes in our government, but I do believe that it is incumbent on every citizen to be on guard against the gradual corruption of power."" This quote shows that Jefferson was not afraid to put in the hard work necessary to ensure that his government remained accountable and just.

In addition to his political work, Jefferson was also a prolific writer. He wrote extensively on a variety of topics, including philosophy, science, and politics. In a letter to his friend John Adams, he wrote, ""I am not a slave to fashion, but am guided by reason and truth."" This quote demonstrates that Jefferson was not content to simply follow the crowd, but rather was driven by a desire to seek the truth and to share his ideas with the world.

Jefferson's achievements as an architect are also a testament to his work ethic. He designed the University of Virginia, which was built between 1819 and 1843. The university was a labor of love for Jefferson, and he poured his heart and soul into its design. In a letter to his friend John Adams, he wrote, ""I am not a slave to fashion, but am guided by reason and truth."" This quote shows that Jefferson was not content to simply follow the trends of the time, but rather was driven by a desire to create something truly exceptional.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's accomplishments demonstrate the value of a determined work ethic. His relentless dedication to his work, whether it was as a writer, lawyer, architect, or politician, allowed him to achieve great things. His belief in the importance of hard work and his commitment to seeking the truth are qualities that we can all learn from. As Jefferson himself said",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For this essay, I'm gonna share some steps that I think lead to increased success in life, based on my personal experiences and what I've learned from others.

First of all, I think it's super important to set goals for yourself. Like, what do you want to achieve in life? Do you want to be a great student, a star athlete, or maybe even a famous YouTuber? Whatever it is, write it down and make it specific! Having clear goals helps you stay focused and motivated, and it gives you something to work towards.

Next, I think it's crucial to work hard and put in the effort to achieve those goals. Don't just set them and then slack off – you gotta put in the time and effort to make 'em happen. Whether it's studying for a test, practicing a sport, or creating content for your YouTube channel, you gotta be willing to put in the work.

Another thing that I think is really important is to surround yourself with supportive people. Like, having friends and family who believe in you and encourage you can make all the difference in the world. They can help you stay motivated and inspired, and they can also provide valuable advice and feedback.

And finally, I think it's important to be open to learning and trying new things. Like, just because you're good at one thing doesn't mean you can't be good at something else too. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try new things – you never know what you might discover!

So, in conclusion, I think the steps to increased success in life are setting clear goals, working hard, surrounding yourself with supportive people, and being open to learning and trying new things. By following these steps, I think you can achieve great things and live a fulfilling life. 😊

Oh, and one more thing – don't be afraid to take risks! Sometimes the best things in life come from taking chances and trying new things. So go for it – you never know where it might lead you! 😃",1,llama2_chat,3
"Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, so bear with me! 😅

Okay, so I know some people think having a 10 p.m. weekday curfew for teenagers is a good idea, but I'm not so sure. I mean, I get it, teens can be pretty wild sometimes, but I think there are better ways to handle things.

One argument for a curfew is that it would help us get our homework done. I mean, let's be real, sometimes it's hard to focus on schoolwork when you're out late at night. But, on the other hand, it's not like we're never going to have any fun. Like, come on, we're teenagers! We need some freedom to hang out with our friends and have a good time.

Another thing to consider is stress levels. I know some people think a curfew would help reduce stress, but I'm not so sure. Sometimes, being able to stay out late and relax with my friends is exactly what I need to de-stress. And what about emergency situations? Like, what if there's a family emergency or something? It's not like we can just ignore it because we're grounded.

One thing that really gets to me is how a curfew would affect family support. I mean, my parents are always telling me they want me to have a good time and make memories with my friends, but then they're like, ""Oh, you can't stay out past 10 p.m.!"" It's like, come on, can't we just find a balance?

So, in conclusion, I think having a 10 p.m. weekday curfew for teenagers is not the best idea. It's not like we're going to turn into zombies or something if we're allowed to stay out late. We just need a little freedom to have some fun and make memories with our friends. And who knows, maybe we'll even get our homework done! 😅

Anyway, that's my two cents. Thanks for reading! 😊",1,llama2_chat,3
"As an 8th grade student, I have been researching how other school districts handle Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements for extracurriculars, and I have to say, it's pretty interesting. Some districts require a certain GPA to participate in sports, clubs, and other activities, while others don't have any requirements at all. After looking into it, I think it's important to consider both the pros and cons of having a GPA requirement for extracurriculars at our school.

One of the main arguments for having a GPA requirement is that it helps students prioritize their schoolwork. If students know they need to maintain a certain GPA to participate in extracurriculars, they might be more motivated to focus on their studies and avoid falling behind. This could lead to better grades and a more productive learning environment overall. Plus, it shows that the school values academic achievement and wants to encourage students to take their education seriously.

On the other hand, some people argue that having a GPA requirement can be unfair to students who are struggling academically. What if a student is doing well in their extracurriculars but is having a tough time in a particular class? Should they be punished by being unable to participate in those activities just because of one bad grade? It doesn't seem fair to penalize students for something they can't control.

Another thing to consider is that different GPA policies can affect students' experiences in school in different ways. For example, if a student is in a sport and has to maintain a certain GPA to participate, they might feel more pressure to focus on their grades at the expense of their teamwork and social interactions. On the other hand, if a student is in a club that doesn't have any GPA requirements, they might be more likely to take risks and try new things without worrying about their grades.

In my opinion, I think it's important to have some kind of GPA requirement for extracurriculars, but it shouldn't be too strict. Maybe we could have a range of GPA requirements for different activities, with higher grades required for sports and other competitive activities and lower grades required for clubs and other non-competitive activities. That way,",1,llama2_chat,4
"Hey there! 

So, like, I reckon people become independent by just being themselves, ya know? It's like, when you're true to who you are, you don't need to rely on anyone else to make you feel good about yourself. You gotta be confident in your own skin and not care what others think. That's when you're really living your best life.

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But what about when you need help? You can't do everything on your own!"" And yeah, that's true. But the thing is, when you're independent, you're more likely to ask for help when you need it. You don't gotta be afraid to show vulnerability or weakness. It's okay to not have all the answers, you know?

But, on the other hand, being too dependent on someone else can be, like, super limiting. You can't grow as a person if you're always relying on someone else to make decisions for you. It's like, you gotta take charge of your own life and make your own choices. That way, you can learn and grow from your mistakes, and become a better person because of it.

For example, like, my best friend Sarah, she's always been super independent. She doesn't let anyone else tell her what to do or how to live her life. And you know what? She's way happier and more confident than most of the people I know. She's not afraid to take risks and try new things, and that's something I admire about her.

But, on the other hand, there are also people who are too dependent on others, and it's like, they're missing out on so much. They're always relying on someone else to make decisions for them, and they never learn how to think for themselves. It's like, they're stuck in this never-ending cycle of relying on others, and it's not healthy.

So, in conclusion, being independent is like, super important. It helps you grow as a person and makes you more confident in yourself. But, it's also okay to ask for help when you need it. It",1,llama2_chat,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have had my fair share of challenges and moments of motivation. One of the most impactful experiences I had was when I was a member of the school debate team.

At first, I was hesitant to join the team because I had never really participated in any public speaking events before. However, my friends encouraged me to give it a try and I eventually agreed.

During the first few practices, I struggled to find my voice and my confidence was low. I often felt nervous and unsure of myself, and I found it difficult to come up with arguments to support my team's position.

However, as the practices went on, I began to see improvement. My teammates helped me to develop my arguments and refine my delivery, and I started to feel more confident in my abilities.

As we approached the competition, I was determined to do my best and help my team win. During the tournament, I was faced with a particularly challenging opponent who seemed to be very knowledgeable on the topic at hand.

At first, I was intimidated, but I quickly realized that I had come too far to give up now. I took a deep breath and focused on delivering my arguments with conviction and clarity.

To my surprise, I found that I was able to effectively communicate my ideas and persuade the judges. My team ended up winning the tournament, and I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that I had never felt before.

Looking back on this experience, I realize that it was a defining moment in my life. It taught me the importance of perseverance and self-belief, and it helped me to develop my communication skills and confidence.

I also learned that sometimes, the greatest challenges can lead to the most rewarding experiences. I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the debate team and I will always remember the lessons I learned during that time.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Finishing high school in three years is an intriguing proposition that has gained significant traction in the last few years. On the one hand, completion ahead of schedule is an attractive concept to many students who are eager to begin college and make an impact on the world. Additionally, many students are self-directed and mature enough to handle the rigors of completing high school early. On the other hand, however, there are a few potential drawbacks to consider. The most significant concern is that students may miss out on important experiences, such as extracurricular activities or even friendships, if they leave high school too quickly. Furthermore, without these experiences, students may struggle to develop the very skills necessary for academic and professional success. 

Overall, whether or not completing high school in three years is a good idea is a decision that will vary from person to person. While it may be a great option for certain individuals who are ready to move on to the next phase of their lives, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that students are still able to enjoy and benefit from the high school experience.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4

"Growing up in a supportive family environment can have a tremendous impact on decision making for teens. Having a secure and understanding home to return to gives them the confidence to make decisions that are right for them and follow their own path. On the other hand, growing up in an unsupportive home can be an obstacle for teens who may feel judged and disrespected. This can lead to an atmosphere of fear and hesitancy when making decisions.

No matter the home environment, it is important for teens to recognize their own intrinsic value. This can be a difficult skill to learn since teenagers are still developing their sense of identity and finding direction in life. It is essential for teens to have the strength of mind to understand that they don't have to conform to the expectations of others in order to be accepted or to succeed. Learning to trust and be true to themselves is a valuable asset that can help teens succeed in academics, relationships, and life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay! 😃 So, Emerson and I, we're like totally different people, but we both think learning new things is cool. 🤓 But, like, we have different reasons why it's good for someone who's already good at something to learn something new. 🤔

Emerson thinks it's important to learn new things because it helps us grow as individuals. 🌱 He says that when we learn something new, it helps us see the world in a new way and opens up new possibilities for us. 🌟 Like, imagine if you're really good at playing the guitar, but you decide to learn how to play the piano too! 🎹 It's like, totally different, but it's still a new skill to master, right? 🤓

"Graduating early from high school can be a great opportunity for motivated and actively engaged students who are looking to take their education to the next level. While leaving the traditional high school structure may come with some drawbacks, there are also many potential benefits. Early graduates may be eligible for college credit, may be able to access more school choice options, and may be able to save on college tuition costs by finishing their schooling more quickly. Additionally, there may be additional adult opportunities available to early graduates that their peers who stay the traditional route may miss out on. 

However, early graduates face increased levels of responsibility for their own education that requires more planning and self-direction. Early graduates may miss out on traditional high school activities and may end up with an academic gap between applying for college and leaving high school, especially if college classes or advanced coursework have not been completed. The decision to graduate early from high school should not be taken lightly, and careful consideration should be given to the potential advantages and disadvantages to ensure that the best decision is made.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that planting trees in schools and protecting them is of utmost importance. Trees play a vital role in our ecosystem, and they are essential for the survival of many species. In this essay, I will discuss several reasons why it is important to plant trees in schools and protect them.

Firstly, trees are crucial for maintaining the earth's atmosphere. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which helps regulate the climate and air quality. Trees also play a vital role in preventing soil erosion and reducing water pollution. By planting trees in schools, we can teach students the importance of environmental conservation and the impact that trees can have on the environment.

Secondly, trees provide shade and shelter from the sun and wind. They also help to reduce heat island effects in urban areas, which can be harmful to human health. Additionally, trees can provide habitats for birds, insects, and other wildlife. By protecting these habitats, we can ensure that these species continue to thrive.

Thirdly, trees have many practical benefits. They can be used for timber, fuelwood, and other resources. Trees also help to prevent soil erosion, which can be harmful to agriculture and other industries. Furthermore, trees can be used to combat desertification, which is a major environmental problem.

In my opinion, planting trees in schools and protecting them is of utmost importance. I have had the opportunity to plant trees in my community, and it was a rewarding experience. Not only did it help to improve the environment, but it also taught me the importance of environmental conservation. I believe that every student should have the opportunity to learn about the importance of trees and how they can help to protect the environment.

In conclusion, planting trees in schools and protecting them is of utmost importance. Trees play a vital role in our ecosystem, and they are essential for the survival of many species. By teaching students the importance of environmental conservation, we can ensure that future generations will continue to take care of our planet.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As the debate over how to best enhance the educational system rages on, one potential solution that has recently captivated the attention of many is extending the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Supporters of this plan point to the potential benefits, such as students having more time to dedicate to mastering core material and teachers having the opportunity to provide more personalized instruction and one-on-one time. They also point out the potential for creative activities, such as extracurriculars, clubs, and field trips, to be better integrated into the structure of a shortened school week.

However, upping the amount of time our children spend at school can also have some unwanted side effects. For one, students may feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the amount of schoolwork and homework they must take on with the extended school day. In addition, lack of sleep, an unhealthy diet, and increased exposure to stress can all lead to poor academic performance. Furthermore, there may be costs associated with the shift to a four-day week that are too expensive for some families.

Ultimately, it is crucial that all stakeholders—parents, teachers, administrators, and students—come together and carefully weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages of extending the school day two hours in a four-day week before enacting any changes. It is only through discussion and thoughtful deliberation that we can ensure that such changes will be made in the best interest of our children’s education.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students have been forced to attend classes from home, and some have even chosen to continue with online or video conferencing classes even after the pandemic has subsided. While there are certainly advantages to distance learning, there are also potential time-management issues and effects on academic outcomes that must be considered. In this essay, I will conduct research on the advantages of offering a distance learning option for students and argue in favor of providing distance instruction.

One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the flexibility it offers. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially beneficial for those who have busy schedules or who have difficulty commuting to school. This flexibility can also allow students to better balance their academic and personal lives. For example, a student who works part-time may be able to attend classes during the day and then work in the evenings, or a student who has a family to take care of may be able to attend classes while their children are at school.

Another advantage of distance learning is the ability to access a wider range of courses. Many schools may not offer certain courses in-person, but they may be available online. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a particular area of study, but who may not have access to the necessary resources or expertise in their local area.

Despite these advantages, there are also potential time-management issues that students may face when learning from home. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track and complete their coursework in a timely manner. This can be especially challenging for students who are prone to procrastination or who have difficulty staying organized. To mitigate these issues, students may need to develop strong time-management skills and establish a routine that allows them to effectively balance their academic and personal responsibilities.

In terms of academic outcomes, research has shown that students who attend classes from home tend to perform just as well as those who attend classes in-person. In fact, some studies have even found that students who attend classes online may have an advantage in certain areas, such as self-motivation and the ability to learn at their own pace. However, it is important to note that academic outcomes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the quality of instruction, the",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Creating a character is a great way to express yourself and explore your creativity. You can draw influence from a number of different sources and combine them to create a unique, memorable character. The possibilities are endless, whether you’re inspired by a favorite book, movie, or video game, or just make it up entirely.

When crafting your character, consider any improvements you could make to the original source material. For example, if your character is based on a beloved movie or TV show character, play around with the unique qualities that make them so memorable - but with your own spin. This could mean changing the character’s back story, career path, relationships, challenges faced, or even their physical appearance.

Be sure to take the time to really think through the emotions and motivations that drive your character. What drives them? What is their deepest desire? By doing this, you can create a fully-formed character who feels real and is memorable to your audience.

Creating a character from scratch can be incredibly cathartic and rewarding. As you craft and develop your character, you can learn more about yourself and your own creativity in the process. There is no one “right” way to structure your character, so have fun and let your imagination take the lead.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Self-esteem and school success are intimately intertwined. A strong and positive sense of self-worth can form the foundations for a student to reach for academic goals, believing in their ability to offer solutions and challenge intellectual tasks.

Although the journey of success can be long and winding, the feeling of accomplishment that comes from achieving goals can provide a sense of pride that is essential for a healthy self-esteem. As students become more successful in school, their confidence will grow and they will be more willing to take on more difficult tasks and see them through to completion. A strong self-esteem is the cornerstone to success in school, and achieving success in school can help to reinforce a student's self-esteem further.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Winston Churchill is a well-known figure in history for his leadership during World War II. He is also known for his quote, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote highlights the importance of perseverance in the face of failure.

Failure is a natural part of life, and it can be a valuable learning experience. It can help us identify areas where we need to improve and give us the opportunity to try again with new knowledge and skills. However, some people may lose enthusiasm after failing multiple times, feeling discouraged and defeated.

There are several reasons why someone may lose enthusiasm after failing multiple times. One reason is that they may feel like they are not cut out for success, or that they will never be able to achieve their goals. Another reason is that they may feel like they are wasting their time and energy on something that is not worth it.

Despite these reasons, it is important to remember that failure is not the end of the road. In fact, it can be a stepping stone to success. For example, Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he finally invented the light bulb. Each failure brought him closer to his goal and allowed him to learn from his mistakes.

One scenario that illustrates how someone can be successful despite failure is the story of J.K. Rowling. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected by multiple publishers before finally being accepted. However, Rowling did not give up and continued to write and refine her story. Today, the Harry Potter series is one of the most successful book and movie franchises of all time.

It is important to not lose enthusiasm after failing multiple times because it can lead to a negative mindset and a lack of motivation. Instead, we should use failure as a learning opportunity and continue to work towards our goals with determination and perseverance.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's quote reminds us that success is not final and failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts. We should not lose enthusiasm after failing multiple times, but instead use it as a learning opportunity to become more successful. By being consistent and not giving up after failure, we can achieve our goals and make a positive impact on the world.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Accomplishment in the workplace is like, super important, you know? It's like, how successful you are in your job and how much you get done. And there are like, a bunch of factors that can affect it.

First, there's motivation. If you're not motivated to do your job, you're not gonna get much done. Like, if you don't care about your job, you're not gonna work hard and you're not gonna be very successful. But if you're motivated, you'll be like, super focused and you'll get a lot done.

Another factor is, like, your skills and knowledge. If you're good at your job and you know how to do it, you'll be able to accomplish more. Like, if you're a graphic designer and you know how to use Photoshop, you can make really cool designs and stuff. But if you don't know how to use it, you won't be able to make anything good.

And then there's, like, the people you work with. If you work with people who are supportive and helpful, you'll be more likely to be successful. Like, if you work with people who are nice and who will help you when you need it, you'll be able to get more done. But if you work with people who are mean and who don't want you to succeed, it'll be harder for you to accomplish things.

But, like, my conclusion is that the most important factor is motivation. If you're motivated, you'll be able to do stuff and be successful. And if you're not motivated, you won't be able to do stuff and you won't be successful. So, like, it's really important to be motivated if you want to be successful in the workplace.

"In today's world, people often struggle with how to influence others. There are many methods that people use to try to get others to do what they want, but not all of them are effective. In this essay, I will evaluate the effectiveness of setting a good example as a way to influence others in contrast to authoritarian and traditional methods.

One of the most common methods used to influence others is through authoritarianism. This involves using force or coercion to get others to do what you want. While this method may seem effective in the short term, it is not sustainable in the long run. People are more likely to resist authority when they feel that they are being forced to do something. Additionally, authoritarianism can damage relationships and create a hostile environment.

Another method that is often used to influence others is through tradition. This involves following the norms and expectations of a particular culture or society. While this method may seem effective in the short term, it can also be limiting. People may be hesitant to deviate from tradition, even if it means missing out on new opportunities. Additionally, tradition can be based on outdated values and beliefs, which can lead to stagnation and lack of progress.

In contrast to these methods, setting a good example is a more effective way to influence others. When you set a good example, you demonstrate what you believe in and what you want others to do. This can be more persuasive than simply telling someone what to do, because people are more likely to follow someone who they respect and admire. Additionally, setting a good example can create a positive atmosphere and foster collaboration and teamwork.

Furthermore, setting a good example can be more sustainable in the long run. When people see that you are consistently doing the right thing, they are more likely to follow your lead. This can lead to a culture of integrity and honesty, which can be beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.

In conclusion, while there are many methods that people use to influence others, setting a good example is the most effective. This method is more persuasive, sustainable, and creates a positive atmosphere. While authoritarianism and tradition may seem effective in the short term, they can be limiting and damaging in the long run. By setting a good example, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

School hours should totally be extended! I know some people might be like ""Ugh, more school? No way!"" But hear me out.

First of all, let's talk about why we even have school in the first place. It's not just to learn stuff, okay? It's also to prepare us for the real world. And let's be real, the real world doesn't stop at 3pm. Why should school? I mean, think about it. Most of us are still kids when we're in school, but we're also growing up and becoming adults. We need to learn how to handle our time, how to manage our schedules, and how to be responsible. And that's exactly what longer school hours can help us do.

Now, I know some people might be like ""But won't longer school hours just make us more tired and grumpy?"" And yeah, maybe at first. But think about it this way: we're already at school for like 7 hours a day, and that's not even enough time to learn everything we need to know! If we had more time in school, we could learn more stuff, and we could do it more slowly and carefully. And that would actually make us smarter and more prepared for the real world.

Plus, think about all the stuff we could do with more time in school. We could have more electives, like art or music or sports. We could have more time for homework, so we don't have to stay up late doing it. And we could even have more time for extracurricular activities, like clubs or volunteer work. That would be awesome!

But, I know some people might be like ""But what about our free time? We need time to relax and hang out with our friends!"" And yeah, that's totally important too. But think about it this way: we're not just kids, we're also students. And students need to take their education seriously. And if we have more time in school, we can take our education more seriously, and we can learn more stuff. And that's good for us in the long run.

So, in conclusion, school hours should totally",1,llama2_chat,1
"Finding out who you are and what your purpose is in life is a journey that requires self-reflection and exploration. There are different perspectives that can help you discover your true self and your purpose, including family, friends, society, and your own inner voice. However, being yourself in a world that can be hostile and unsupportive can be challenging. In this essay, I will brainstorm ways to find out who you are and what your purpose is in life, and make a plan for how you will strive to remain true to yourself in spite of it all.

One way to discover your true self is by listening to your family and friends. They may have insights and perspectives that can help you understand your strengths, weaknesses, and values. They may also be able to provide support and encouragement as you navigate your journey of self-discovery. However, it's important to remember that their opinions may not always align with your own, and it's important to trust your own instincts and beliefs.

Another way to discover your true self is by exploring society and the world around you. Observing the people around you, their behaviors, and their beliefs can help you understand what you value and what you don't. It can also help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, as well as your areas for improvement. However, it's important to remember that society can be a double-edged sword, and it's important to be critical of the messages and values that are being promoted.

Your own inner voice is also an important source of guidance and self-discovery. It's important to listen to your intuition and your emotions, as they can provide insights and perspectives that may not be immediately apparent. However, it's also important to be mindful of your thoughts and beliefs, as they can be influenced by external factors such as media and popular culture.

Being yourself in a world that can be hostile and unsupportive can be challenging. It's important to be aware of the potential risks and challenges, and to have a plan in place to navigate them. One way to do this is by building a support system of friends, family, and mentors who can provide encouragement and guidance. It's also important to be resilient and to have a growth mindset, as setbacks and challenges are inevitable.

"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of being independent and taking care of myself. There have been several times in my life where I have faced challenges that have taught me to be more self-reliant and confident in my abilities.

One of the first times I remember learning to be independent was when I was in fifth grade. My family was going on a camping trip, and my dad asked me to help set up the tent. At first, I was nervous and unsure of what to do. However, my dad encouraged me to try and gave me step-by-step instructions on how to set up the tent. I was determined to succeed, and after a few tries, I was able to set up the tent on my own. This experience taught me the importance of taking initiative and not being afraid to ask for help when needed.

Another time I learned to be independent was when I was in seventh grade. I was part of a school project with a group of my classmates, and we were tasked with creating a presentation on a topic of our choice. One of my classmates had a family emergency and was unable to attend our meetings. It was up to me and the other group members to continue working on the presentation without her. This experience taught me the importance of being flexible and adapting to unexpected situations.

Being independent also involves taking care of oneself, both physically and mentally. I have learned the importance of self-care through various experiences. For example, when I was in sixth grade, I was dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety. I started practicing meditation and journaling regularly, and it helped me manage my stress levels and improve my overall well-being. This experience taught me the importance of taking care of my mental health and prioritizing self-care.

Other people have also influenced me in my journey towards independence. My parents have always encouraged me to be independent and take risks. They have taught me that it's okay to make mistakes and that I can learn from them. My friends have also been a source of support and encouragement. They have helped me build my confidence and given me the courage to pursue my dreams.

In conclusion, being independent and taking care of oneself is an important part of growing up. Through various experiences, I have learned the importance of taking initiative, being flexible, and prioritizing self-care",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have set a goal for myself to achieve an A in my science class. This goal is attainable, as I have a strong foundation in science and I am determined to put in the necessary effort to achieve it.

To reach my goal, I have broken down the larger goal into smaller steps. The first step is to review the syllabus and understand the expectations for the class. I will also review my previous grades in science and identify areas where I need to improve.

Next, I will determine the resources I need to reach my goal. This includes textbooks, online resources, and practice tests. I will also seek out help from my teacher and classmates if I need it.

Once I have gathered the necessary resources, I will begin researching and learning the necessary skills and concepts required to achieve my goal. This will involve reading and studying the material, taking notes, and asking questions.

After I have learned the material, I will try out the skills I have learned and get feedback. This will help me identify areas where I need to improve and focus my efforts accordingly.

Finally, I will keep practicing to master the skill until I achieve my goal. This will involve completing assignments, taking practice tests, and seeking out additional resources if necessary.

Throughout this process, I will not give up and will keep trying, even when the going gets tough. I believe that with hard work and dedication, I can achieve my goal of an A in science.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that following someone else's agreement when it comes to self-growth and development can have both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, following someone else's agreement can provide a sense of structure and guidance, which can be beneficial for personal growth. On the other hand, following someone else's agreement can limit individuality and creativity, which can hinder personal growth.

One example of the positive consequences of following someone else's agreement is when it comes to fitness and nutrition. Many people find it helpful to follow a specific diet or exercise plan that has been proven to be effective. By following someone else's agreement, individuals can gain knowledge and guidance on how to achieve their fitness goals. This can lead to improved health and well-being, which can positively impact other areas of life.

However, following someone else's agreement can also limit individuality and creativity. For example, if someone follows a specific workout or diet plan without considering their own unique needs and preferences, they may find it difficult to stick to the plan in the long run. Additionally, following someone else's agreement can lead to a lack of self-discovery and personal growth. If individuals do not learn how to make their own decisions and take ownership of their choices, they may struggle to develop their own unique identity and values.

In conclusion, while following someone else's agreement can provide structure and guidance, it is important to balance this with individuality and creativity. By considering one's own unique needs and preferences, individuals can develop a personalized plan that will lead to sustainable growth and development.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Reading books has been found to offer many benefits for a variety of different groups. For example, kids who read for enjoyment show better academic performance and develop better critical thinking skills. Moreover, adults who read for educational or professional purposes are also likely to improve their knowledge and understanding of the topic. Elderly people who read non-fiction books increase their overall psychological wellbeing and reduce their stress levels.

Playing sports and watching games can both offer different advantages. Playing sports offers the potential for physical exercise, the opportunity to learn and improve skills, and the chance to build meaningful connections with peers. Watching games, on the other hand, allows people to be more passive observers of the action, and can bring them closer together with others who share their passion for the same sport.

People shop for many reasons, and in several different environments. Shopping for necessities, such as food, often takes place in larger stores offering a wide selection, while shopping for luxury items often happens in more specialized boutique stores. People may also choose to shop online in order to browse a greater variety of products and take advantage of convenience.

Team sports can be appealing to some students, as it allows them to build relationships with other players, develop a sense of belonging, and have better communication skills. Team sports offer opportunities for personal growth, as students can learn from experienced coaches and players, work together to reach common goals, and learn how to work together in a team.

Playing sports can have many benefits, both for physical health and personal growth. Regular physical activity helps to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, while team sports can also help to foster personal connections and improve communication skills. Additionally, playing sports can be a great way to make new friends and improve social skills, while trying different activity can put people in new and exciting environments.

Shopping for clothing and beauty products is a great way for people to express themselves and be creative. The vast range of different clothes and cosmetics allows people to experiment with their appearance, discover their style, and find new products that they may not have been aware of before. Shopping can also provide a great opportunity to find bargains, making it a great way to save money.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay! 😃

So, Ralph Waldo Emerson said that unless we challenge ourselves to do things beyond what we're already good at, we'll never grow. Like, I can totally relate to this. I mean, I'm only in 8th grade, but I've noticed that when I push myself to try new things, I get better at 'em. Like, I never thought I could be good at soccer, but now I'm on the school team and I'm actually pretty good! 🏈

But it's not just about sports. I've noticed that when I try to do things that are harder than what I'm used to, like solving math problems or reading more challenging books, I feel like I'm growing as a person. It's like my brain is expanding or something! 🧠

Now, I know some people might not have the same opportunities to grow as others. Like, some kids might not have access to good schools or resources, or they might be dealing with stuff at home that makes it hard for them to focus on their studies. That's why it's important for us to help those people out. We can volunteer at local organizations that support kids who are struggling, or we can raise money to fund programs that provide opportunities for kids to learn and grow.

But it's not just about giving back to the community. It's also about recognizing that everyone has potential, no matter where they come from. Like, even if someone's on the street or struggling with poverty, they still have talents and abilities that can help them succeed. We just need to give them the chance to discover them.

So, what can we do to address this issue? Well, we can start by being more aware of the opportunities and resources available to people around us. We can also advocate for policies that support education and personal growth, like funding for schools and programs that help people get back on their feet. And most importantly, we can treat everyone with respect and dignity, no matter their situation.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement is super true. If we don't challenge ourselves to do more",1,llama2_chat,1
"Dear Principal,

I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed addition of one and a half hours of school. While I understand the importance of education, I believe that this proposal will have negative consequences for students and their families.

Firstly, the increased school hours will put students at risk of walking in the dark, especially if they are not picked up by their parents or guardians. This is particularly concerning for students who live in areas with high crime rates or poor lighting. The longer school hours will also reduce the amount of time that students have for family and friends, which is essential for their social and emotional well-being. This could lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which could negatively impact their mental health.

Secondly, the proposed increase in school hours will have a significant impact on students' participation in sports and leisure activities. Many students participate in sports teams or clubs outside of school, and the additional school hours will make it difficult for them to attend practices and games. This could lead to a decline in their physical activity levels and overall health. Additionally, the longer school hours will reduce the amount of time that students have for hobbies and interests, which are crucial for their personal development and happiness.

Finally, there is a risk that students will become disinterested in school and stop attending if the school day is extended. This could lead to a decline in academic performance and a decrease in the overall quality of education. Students who are disengaged from school are less likely to achieve their full potential and are more likely to drop out of school.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the proposed addition of one and a half hours of school. The risks to students' safety, well-being, and academic performance outweigh any potential benefits. I urge you to reconsider this proposal and instead focus on finding ways to improve the existing school schedule to better support the needs of students and their families.

Sincerely,

"Partnering with companies in the field students are interested in pursuing provides a wealth of benefits. Through such partnerships, students can acquire the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to succeed in their chosen career. Student partnerships offer the opportunity to gain real-world experience and exposure to the industry by attending conferences and seminars, networking within the industry, or gaining a better understanding of the company’s technology or product. Additionally, such partnerships give students the chance to build relationships with influential people, which can lead to job offers, internships, and other professional benefits.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to these partnerships. Companies are looking for the best and brightest talent, and some students may feel pressure to meet these expectations. Furthermore, developing relationships with industry professionals can add extra time demands and strain to an already busy academic schedule. Lastly, there is the risk that students may not be adequately prepared for the challenges of such partnerships, so it is important to assess individual capabilities before entering into a student-company partnership.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Ummm... 

Okay, so like, last week I had this super frustrating problem with my best friend. We were supposed to work on this group project together, but she kept, like, not showing up and not answering my messages. And I was all, ""Ugh, what do I do now?""

I tried talking to her and stuff, but she just kept making excuses and stuff. And I was like, ""Girl, I'm not gonna do all the work myself!"" So I was all, ""Forget it, I'm not gonna do the project without you!"" And I didn't.

But then she was all, ""Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to be so lazy!"" And I was like, ""Yeah, no kidding."" And we ended up finishing the project together, but it was all, like, super stressful and stuff.

I guess I could have, like, talked to her more and stuff, instead of just getting all mad and stuff. But I was feeling really upset and stuff, so I didn't know how to handle it. And now I know that I should have been more patient and stuff.

So, like, next time I'll try to be more patient and stuff, and not get so mad and stuff. And I'll also try to communicate more and stuff, instead of just being all, like, ""Forget it, I'm not doing it!"" And stuff.

"Believing in oneself and having hope in life is essential to achieving success and happiness. It is easy to get discouraged and lose hope when faced with challenges, but it is important to remember that life is full of ups and downs, and that failure is a natural part of the process.

One of the most important lessons I have learned from life is that it is important to stay positive and never give up. When faced with challenges, it is easy to become discouraged and lose hope, but it is important to remember that these challenges are temporary and that they can be overcome. It is also important to believe in oneself and have confidence in one's abilities, even when faced with failure.

Another important lesson I have learned from life is that it is important to stay motivated and continue to work towards one's goals. When faced with obstacles, it is easy to become discouraged and lose motivation, but it is important to remember that progress is often slow and that setbacks are a natural part of the process. It is also important to stay focused on one's goals and to continue to work towards them, even when faced with challenges.

Failing to have hope can have negative effects on one's life. When one lacks hope, it can be difficult to find the motivation to continue working towards one's goals. It can also be difficult to overcome challenges and setbacks, as one may feel like giving up. Additionally, a lack of hope can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety, which can have a negative impact on one's mental and physical health.

In conclusion, believing in oneself and having hope in life is essential to achieving success and happiness. It is important to remember that life is full of ups and downs, and that failure is a natural part of the process.

"Schools should offer an after school homework club in order to support students and their academic success. The club would provide a place for students to complete their homework with the help of their peers and staff. There are three points to consider when advocating for an after school homework club: access to the resources needed, more contact time with teachers, and providing a community support system. 

First, an after school homework club would give students more access to the resources they need to complete their assignments. It would be a great place for students in need of tutoring or help with their homework to find the assistance they need. This would allow them to move past any challenging subjects and have the ability to learn more effectively.

Second, the club would provide more contact time with teachers that can provide above and beyond instruction. This open environment would allow students to get the one-on-one help they need to understand course material. In addition, it would allow teachers to observe student progress in a less formal setting, and provide better feedback on students enrollment and test taking performance. 

Finally, the club would provide a community support system for students. It would be a space for them to talk to their peers over a common interest or goal -homework- instead of a distraction like social media. This would be beneficial in allowing students to find support from their friends and allow them to gain confidence and self-esteem.

Overall, an after school homework club would give more access to the resources needed, a chance for more contact with teachers, and provide a community support system. These reasons make it essential that schools must offer an after school homework club to ensure the success of their students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that both traditional in-person educational instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. While traditional in-person instruction provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers face-to-face, distance learning allows for more flexibility and convenience.

One of the main advantages of traditional in-person instruction is the opportunity for students to interact with their peers and teachers. This interaction allows for the development of social skills and the ability to collaborate with others. Additionally, in-person instruction provides students with immediate feedback from their teachers, which can help them identify areas where they need to improve.

On the other hand, distance learning provides students with more flexibility and convenience. Students can learn at their own pace, and they can access course materials at any time. This allows students to balance their studies with other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities. Additionally, distance learning can be more cost-effective than traditional in-person instruction, as it eliminates the need for commuting and other expenses associated with attending classes on-campus.

However, there are also some disadvantages to both forms of instruction. One disadvantage of traditional in-person instruction is that it can be difficult for students to attend classes if they live far away from the school. Additionally, in-person instruction can be less accessible for students with disabilities, as they may need specialized accommodations that are not available in a traditional classroom setting.

Distance learning also has its disadvantages. One disadvantage is that students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers and teachers. Additionally, distance learning can be more challenging for students who require more structure and guidance in their studies. Without the support of their peers and teachers, these students may struggle to stay on track and achieve their academic goals.

In my personal opinion, both traditional in-person instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the individual student's needs and circumstances. For students who require more structure and guidance in their studies, traditional in-person instruction may be the best option. However, for students who need more flexibility and convenience, distance learning may be the better choice.

In conclusion, both traditional in-person instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. While traditional in-person instruction provides students with the opportunity",1,llammistral7binstruct,1

"Being true to yourself is one of the most important things you can do, both for yourself and for those around you. It’s about being honest with yourself and other people, and being genuine in all aspects of life. When we pretend to be something we’re not, the consequences are serious and can cause lasting damage to our relationships with others and our own wellbeing. It can cause us to feel inauthentic and untrue to ourselves, creating confusion and doubts about our own determine life paths.

On the other hand, being ourselves allows us to be fully accepted and understood by the people in our lives. We can openly express who we really are, no matter how seemingly small. When we do this, we can start to establish long lasting meaningful connections and relationships with other people. We can also learn how to respect and value our own opinions and perspectives, instead of constantly worrying about what others think. 

Ultimately, being true to yourself is essential to our wellbeing and to our relationships. It helps to create authenticity, which is something that should not be taken lightly. Being genuine comes from within and it can only be expressed externally when we are also true to ourselves. We must embrace our authentic selves and take the courage to express them to others.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"One of the greatest examples of success against the odds is Wilma Rudolph, a champion Olympian who overcame childhood polio to become one of the greatest sprinters in history. Despite hardships, she pursued her goal of athletic greatness and achieved it, against all odds. Even when presented with failure, Wilma saw it as a learning experience and she was motivated to strive for the success she deserved. Along with her own hard work, she was driven by her determination and a determination to reach her own potential. 

Rather than aiming low and potentially missing out on success, it is better to aim higher and work hard to make one’s dreams come true. With hard work, dedication and the will to strive for success, great things can be achieved, no matter the odds. Achieving partially is better than not achieving at all, and the possibility of not reaching a goal is far less than the possibility of success. Ultimately, it is better to aim high and strive for success, as it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to reach for one’s goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"As technology continues to advance, remote learning has become more prevalent in education. While there are certainly benefits to attending classes from home, there are also drawbacks that must be considered. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of remote learning and consider how student attendance and the educational system may be affected by this shift.

One of the main benefits of remote learning is the flexibility it provides. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which eliminates the need for commuting and allows them to balance their studies with other responsibilities such as work or family obligations. This flexibility can lead to increased student attendance, as students are more likely to attend classes if they can do so from the comfort of their own homes.

Another benefit of remote learning is the ability to personalize the learning experience. With remote learning, students can work at their own pace and take the time they need to understand the material. This allows for a more individualized approach to education, which can lead to better academic outcomes.

However, there are also drawbacks to remote learning that must be considered. One of the main drawbacks is the potential for decreased student engagement. When students are not physically present in the classroom, they may be less likely to participate in class discussions and activities. This can lead to a less engaging and interactive learning experience.

Another drawback of remote learning is the potential for decreased student attendance. While remote learning provides flexibility, it can also lead to procrastination and a lack of motivation. This can result in students missing classes and falling behind in their studies.

In order to effectively implement remote learning, the educational system will need to make adjustments. This may include providing more resources and support for students, such as online tutoring and access to educational materials. The educational system will also need to adapt to the unique challenges of remote learning, such as ensuring that students have access to reliable internet and technology.

In conclusion, while remote learning has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. The flexibility and personalization provided by remote learning can lead to increased student attendance and better academic outcomes. However, the potential for decreased student engagement and attendance must be carefully considered. In order to effectively implement remote learning, the educational system will need to make adjustments and provide the necessary resources and support for students. Ultimately, the decision to attend classes from home should be made on a case",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay about how developing a positive attitude can help a person achieve success in life! 😃

So, like, I know some people might think that success is all about being super smart or talented, but I think it's way more important to have a positive attitude. Like, if you're always thinking negative thoughts and stuff, you're gonna have a hard time achieving your goals. But, if you're all like, ""I can do this! 💪"", then you're way more likely to succeed!

I mean, think about it. Like, there are tons of successful people out there who have achieved their goals because of their positive attitude. For example, Oprah Winfrey is like, super successful, and she's always talking about how important it is to have a positive mindset. And, like, Richard Branson, he's a billionaire and he's always saying that he's grateful for everything he has, even when things get tough.

So, like, it's totally important to have a positive attitude because it helps you stay motivated and focused on your goals. And, like, it's way easier to bounce back from setbacks when you have a positive attitude. Instead of getting all down and stuff, you can just be like, ""Okay, this didn't work out, but I'll try again tomorrow!""

And, like, I think it's also important to be grateful for what you have, even if it's not a lot. Like, when I was in 7th grade, I didn't have the best grades, but I was still grateful for the education I was getting. And, like, now that I'm in 8th grade, I'm way more confident in my abilities, and I know that I can achieve my goals.

So, like, how can individuals create a plan to reach their own goals and be successful? Well, I think it's important to set specific, measurable goals, and then make a plan to achieve them. And, like, it's also important to be flexible and open to change, because sometimes things don't go as planned. But, like, if you stay positive",1,llama2_chat,2
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay!  So, the current educational system is like, totally fine and all, but have you guys heard about this four-day school week with an extended two hours thingy?  I think it's like, really interesting and stuff, so I'm gonna analyze it and see if it's like, actually a good idea or not. 🤔

First of all, let's talk about the advantages of a four-day school week.  One of the main benefits is that it gives students more time to like, you know, relax and recharge their batteries.  I mean, we're already in school for like, eight hours a day, which is like, a long time. So, having an extra day off would be like, super nice. Plus, it could help us be more focused and stuff when we are in school. 

But, there are also some disadvantages to consider.  One of them is that it could be harder for students to like, balance their schedules and stuff.  Like, if we have an extended school day, it could be harder to fit in extracurricular activities and stuff. And, it could also be harder for parents to like, you know, get us to school on time and stuff. 

And, let's talk about the potential impact on students achieving their academic goals.  I think it could be like, both good and bad.  On the one hand, having more time in school could help us learn more and stuff.  But, on the other hand, it could also be like, harder to focus and stuff if we're already in school for longer. 

So, like, overall, I think the four-day school week with an extended two hours is like, a pretty interesting idea.  But, we should definitely consider all the pros and cons before making a decision.  Like, it could be like, really good for some people, but bad for others. *",1,llama2_chat,2
"Hey there! 

Summer vacation, the time of year when we get to take a break from the daily grind of school and just relax. But, have you ever thought about how long it should actually be? Some people say that longer summer vacations are the way to go, while others think that shorter ones are better. In this essay, I'm gonna argue that longer summer vacations are the way to go. 

First of all, let's talk about why people might want shorter summer vacations. Some people think that longer vacations can be a burden on parents, especially those who have to work to support their families. They might argue that shorter vacations are more practical and help parents save money on childcare costs.  But, I think that's a pretty weak argument. I mean, parents work hard all year round to provide for their kids, so they deserve a break too!  And, let's be real, kids can be a handful sometimes, so parents might need a little extra time to recharge their batteries.

Now, let's talk about why longer summer vacations are better. For one thing, they give us more time to explore our passions and interests. Whether it's playing music, reading books, or learning a new language, having more time to focus on these things can help us become more well-rounded individuals. Plus, it can give us a chance to travel and see new places, which can broaden our horizons and help us appreciate different cultures.  And, let's not forget about the academic benefits! Studies have shown that kids who have longer summer vacations tend to perform better in school, since they come back refreshed and ready to learn. 

But, some people might argue that longer summer vacations can be bad for our education. They might say that it takes away from the learning we do during the school year, since we're not in class as much. But, I think that's a pretty weak argument too. I mean, learning doesn't just happen in the classroom! We can learn so much from our experiences outside of school, and having more time to explore and discover new things can",1,llama2_chat,3
"I remember a time in high school when I learned an important lesson that has shaped my mindset and behavior. It was my sophomore year, and I was taking a science class. We were working on a group project, and I was assigned to work with a classmate named Sarah. At first, I thought Sarah was easygoing and fun to work with, but as the project progressed, I began to realize that she was not taking it seriously. She would often miss meetings and fail to contribute to the group's efforts.

One day, I confronted Sarah about her lack of commitment, and she responded defensively, accusing me of being too strict and uptight. I was taken aback by her reaction and began to question my own behavior. Was I being too hard on her? Was I being too critical?

After some reflection, I realized that my behavior was not the problem. Sarah's lack of commitment was not my fault, and I should not be held responsible for her actions. I also realized that I needed to communicate more effectively with my group members and be more understanding of their individual needs and circumstances.

From that experience, I learned the importance of effective communication and setting clear expectations. I also learned to be more empathetic and understanding of others' perspectives. This lesson has affected my life in many ways, both personally and professionally. In my personal life, I have become more aware of my own behavior and how it affects those around me. I have also become more confident in my ability to communicate effectively and resolve conflicts in a respectful and productive manner.

In my professional life, I have applied this lesson by being more mindful of my interactions with colleagues and clients. I have learned to listen actively, ask questions, and provide constructive feedback. I have also become more aware of my own biases and assumptions, and have made an effort to challenge them and be more open-minded.

In conclusion, the lesson I learned in high school has had a profound impact on my life. It has taught me the importance of effective communication, setting clear expectations, and being empathetic and understanding of others. I will continue to apply this lesson in all aspects of my life, and I am grateful for the experience that taught me such an important lesson.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Hey there!  So, um, I guess I'm supposed to write an essay about studying from home, right?  Like, I know some people think it's cool and all, but I gotta be honest, I'm not so sure. 

First of all, let's talk about the benefits.  Okay, so like, when you're at home, you can kinda set your own schedule, you know? You can take breaks whenever you want, and you don't have to worry about, like, getting to class on time or anything. Plus, you can eat whatever you want  and not have to deal with cafeteria food. 

But,  there are also some drawbacks.  Like, when you're at home, you don't get that physical interaction with your classmates and teachers.  You know, it's important to have that face-to-face time, 'cause it helps you stay motivated and all.  And, um, sometimes it's hard to focus when you're at home, 'cause there's so many distractions  like, TV, video games, and  your phone. 

And,  you know, distance learning can also impact your mental health.  Like, sometimes it's hard to keep up with the workload, and you can start to feel really stressed out and overwhelmed.  And, um, it can be hard to stay motivated when you're not in a classroom setting. 

But,  I think schools can manage distance learning by, like, setting clear expectations and deadlines, and making sure students have access to the resources they need.  And, um, students can still be motivated to learn by, like, setting goals and rewards, and finding ways to stay engaged with their classmates and teachers.",1,llama2_chat,4
"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, so bear with me! 😅

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you only get one chance to make a good one. But, is it really impossible to change them? I mean, I've had some pretty solid first impressions of people that have ended up being totally wrong. Like, whoa.

For example, there's this one kid in my class named Jake. When we first met, he was being really quiet and reserved, so I thought he was kinda boring. BUT, like, a week later, he started sitting with me and my friends at lunch and he's actually really funny and cool! I was like, ""Whoa, I totally misjudged you, Jake!"" 😂

Another time, I met this new teacher, Mrs. Johnson. She seemed really strict and annoying at first, but then I realized she's actually really nice and cares about her students. Like, she actually knows our names and stuff! So, yeah, my first impression of her was totally wrong. 🙊

It's like, sometimes people can come off a certain way at first, but then you get to know them and they're actually really cool. And vice versa, sometimes people can seem really nice at first, but then they turn out to be not so great. It's all about giving people a chance and not judging them based on one impression.

But, like, it's not just about the person, it's also about their actions. If someone consistently acts in a certain way, it's gonna be hard to change that first impression. Like, if someone's always late and never follows through on their promises, you're probably gonna think they're irresponsible no matter how many times they try to prove you wrong. 🙄

So, in conclusion, first impressions might be hard to change, but they're not impossible. It's all about giving people a chance and not judging them based on one impression. And, like, actions speak louder than words, so if someone consistently acts in a certain way, it's gonna be hard to change that first",1,llama2_chat,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have significant implications for students, their families, and the local school district. While some may argue that this additional time would improve student performance, I believe that it would have negative consequences on student relationships and overall well-being.

Firstly, adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have a significant impact on student performance. While some may argue that this additional time would allow students to learn more and perform better academically, I believe that it would lead to increased stress and burnout. Students already face a lot of pressure to excel academically, and adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would only increase that pressure. Additionally, students may struggle to balance their academic workload with their extracurricular activities and personal lives, leading to decreased overall well-being.

Furthermore, adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have negative consequences on student relationships with their families and peers. Students already struggle to balance their academic workload with their personal lives, and adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would only make this more challenging. Students may miss out on quality time with their families, leading to strained relationships and decreased overall happiness. Additionally, students may struggle to maintain their relationships with their peers, as they may not have the time to socialize and connect with their friends outside of school.

Finally, adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have significant implications for the local school district. The school district would need to invest in additional resources, such as teachers and facilities, to accommodate the increased student population. This could lead to increased costs, which may not be feasible for some school districts. Additionally, the school district may struggle to find qualified teachers to fill the increased number of positions, leading to decreased overall quality of education.

In conclusion, while some may argue that adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would improve student performance, I believe that it would have negative consequences on student relationships and overall well-being. Additionally, it would have significant implications for the local school district, leading to increased costs and potential decreased quality of education. Instead of adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day, schools should focus on finding innovative ways to improve student learning and well-being",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade self, here to write this essay! 😅

So, the quote ""It is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich"" by John Lubbock is pretty deep, you know? It's like, it's not what we have in life that defines us, but how we use it. Like, if you have a ton of money, but you never use it to help others, then you're not really rich, you know? But if you have next to nothing, but you use it to make a difference, then you're way richer than anyone with a ton of money.

I think this quote is important because it shows that individual character is formed by influences beyond our control. Like, we can't always choose what we have in life, but we can choose how we use it. Our actions and decisions shape who we are as people, and that's what makes us rich. It's not just about having stuff, it's about using it to make a difference in the world.

For example, like, imagine you're super poor and you can't afford food or shelter, but you use your time to volunteer at a soup kitchen or a homeless shelter. That shows that you're rich in character, even if you don't have much in the way of material possessions. On the other hand, if you have a ton of money and you just spend it all on yourself and don't help anyone else, then you're not really rich, you know?

I think this quote also relates to the idea of the ""American Dream."" Like, the idea that if you work hard and do the right thing, you'll be successful and happy. But sometimes, no matter how hard we work, we still face obstacles and challenges that are beyond our control. So, it's important to remember that it's not just about what we have, but how we use it, that makes us rich.

In conclusion, John Lubbock's quote ""It is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich"" is super important because it shows that individual character is formed by influences beyond our control. It's not just about having stuff, it'",1,llama2_chat,4
"Staying Busy: A Pathway to Personal Success

Staying busy is a crucial aspect of achieving personal success. It involves actively pursuing goals and utilizing one's time and resources effectively. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of staying busy and the dangers of being idle.

One of the primary advantages of staying busy is that it helps individuals stay focused and motivated. When we have a clear goal in mind, we are more likely to stay on track and work towards achieving it. For example, a student who is actively studying for an exam will likely perform better than one who is not. This is because the student is using their time and resources effectively, and they are more likely to retain the information they need to succeed.

Another advantage of staying busy is that it can lead to positive results. By actively pursuing goals, individuals are more likely to achieve them. For instance, an athlete who practices regularly is more likely to improve their skills and perform better in competitions. This is because they are putting in the time and effort to hone their abilities.

However, there are also dangers to being idle. When we are not actively pursuing goals, we are more likely to waste our time and resources. For example, spending too much time on social media can lead to a lack of productivity and can negatively impact our mental health. Additionally, being idle can lead to a lack of motivation and focus, which can hinder our ability to achieve our goals.

In conclusion, staying busy is a crucial aspect of achieving personal success. By actively pursuing goals and utilizing our time and resources effectively, we can stay focused and motivated, leading to positive results. However, being idle can lead to a lack of productivity, motivation, and focus, which can hinder our ability to achieve our goals. It is important to find a balance between staying busy and taking breaks to rest and recharge.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always been passionate about music. I have been playing the guitar for several years now and I have found it to be one of the most rewarding hobbies I have ever had. Music has a way of touching the soul and allowing me to express myself in a way that words cannot.

One of the things that I have found most enjoyable about playing the guitar is the ability to create something out of nothing.

"The Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Technology in the Classroom

As technology continues to advance, it has become increasingly common for students to use their cell phones and other electronic devices during class. While there are many benefits to using technology in the classroom, there are also some limitations to consider. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of allowing students to use technology during class for educational purposes.

One of the main benefits of using technology in the classroom is that it can enhance student engagement and motivation. With technology, students can access a wide range of resources and materials, including videos, interactive simulations, and online quizzes. This can make learning more interactive and engaging, which can help students stay focused and motivated. Additionally, technology can be used to create collaborative learning environments, where students can work together on projects and assignments in real-time.

However, there are also some limitations to using technology in the classroom. One of the main concerns is that technology can be a distraction for some students. For example, if students are allowed to use their cell phones during class, they may be tempted to check social media or play games instead of paying attention to the lesson. Additionally, technology can be expensive, and not all schools have the resources to provide students with the latest devices and software. This can create a digital divide between students who have access to technology and those who do not.

When comparing the outcomes of using technology versus traditional books for students of different ages and learning styles, it is important to consider the unique needs and preferences of each group. For younger students, technology may be more engaging and interactive, while older students may prefer more traditional methods of learning. Additionally, some students may be visual learners, while others may prefer more auditory or kinesthetic learning styles. In general, technology can be a useful tool for students of all ages and learning styles, but it is important to use it in a way that is appropriate for each group.

The availability of technology in the classroom can also have a significant impact on student academic performance and engagement. Studies have shown that students who use technology in the classroom tend to perform better academically and are more engaged in their learning. Additionally, technology can be used to provide personalized learning experiences, where students can work at their own pace and receive targeted feedback and support. However, it is important to ensure that technology is used in a way that",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Dear Principal, 

I'm writing to express my views on the school's new sports policy. As you know, the policy has had a significant impact on our student body, myself included. I strongly believe that all students should be given the opportunity to participate in the sports they wish to take part in, no matter their interests or abilities. Not only does this provide students with a much-needed outlet for creative expression but it also encourages physical activity and healthy competition.

Unfortunately, there are some students who have been severely impacted by this policy who are now turning to criminal activities as a result. Although the policy states that students should be given the opportunity to play their chosen sport, many are not being given the same treatment. As a consequence, some students are dropping out, pursuing illicit activities, and in some cases becoming victims themselves. This is a disservice to these students as well as a huge source of disruption to the school. 

I believe that it is essential to provide all students with the chance to participate in the sports they are interested in, as this can help foster a positive environment and reduce the chances of criminal activity. It is my hope that the school will reconsider its current policy and make adjustments to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to take part. Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely,

"The debate surrounding online learning has grown in recent years with a variety of countries and schools considering it a viable educational option. However, there are some countries and schools which do not allow online learning and it is important to understand the consequences students face as a result. Technological capabilities in some of these countries may be limited which could be a contributing factor, however, it is important to note that online learning is not a viable option for all students no matter the technological capabilities of the countries in which they reside. 

The benefits of online learning compared to traditional, in-person schooling are no doubt significant. Online learning grants students much greater flexibility and allows them to engage in educational pursuits from the comfort of their own home. Additionally, online learning is often less costly than traditional in-person schooling since there are no geographic boundaries and students have access to a much larger variety of courses. 

However, online learning does come with its fair share of disadvantages. Students in traditional schooling benefit greatly from the social interaction with their peers, something which is not easily replicated in an online environment despite the advances in technology. Furthermore, the technological equipment required for an optimal online learning experience is often quite expensive. Additionally, some students may not take the online education seriously and be less likely to put in the appropriate effort needed for success. 

Finally, it is important to note that online learning can have many positive outcomes for those who are unable to attend school due to illness or other extenuating circumstances. These individuals can still take part in educational pursuits from the convenience of their own home. It is clear that online learning offers a variety of benefits, both for those who are able to take part in traditional schooling, as well as those who are unable to due to special circumstances.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Deceptive Behaviors and First Impressions

In our daily lives, we often encounter people who use deceptive behaviors to get something or attention. These behaviors can range from small white lies to more serious actions, such as cheating or lying on a resume. While it is important to be honest and trustworthy, there are times when first impressions can be misleading.

For example, a job interviewer may be impressed by a candidate's appearance or their ability to speak confidently, even if their qualifications are not as strong as other candidates. In this case, the candidate may use deceptive behaviors, such as exaggerating their experience or skills, to further impress the interviewer. While this may lead to a job offer, it can also lead to negative consequences down the line.

On the other hand, there are times when first impressions can be accurate. For example, if a person is consistently rude or disrespectful to others, it is likely that they will continue to behave this way in the future. In this case, it is important to use first impressions to make informed decisions about whether or not to interact with the person further.

When it comes to getting a job, it is important to be honest and straightforward in your application materials. While it may be tempting to exaggerate your qualifications or experience, this can lead to negative consequences down the line. Instead, focus on highlighting your strengths and qualifications in a clear and concise manner.

People may change their behavior in order to impress others for a variety of reasons. Some people may do this because they want to fit in with a particular group or because they want to be seen as successful or accomplished. Others may do this because they want to avoid conflict or because they want to be liked or admired.

However, it is important to remember that people are not always who they seem to be. While it may be tempting to judge someone based on their behavior, it is important to consider other factors as well, such as their background and experiences.

In conclusion, while deceptive behaviors can be tempting, it is important to be honest and straightforward in all aspects of our lives. When making decisions about people or situations, it is important to consider all available information and to use our judgement wisely. Whether it is in the workplace or in our personal lives, it is important to be",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. There are several advantages to doing so, including increased focus, motivation, and direction.

Firstly, identifying a career early on can help students to focus their efforts and set specific goals for themselves. This can lead to a more motivated and driven attitude towards their education, as they will have a clear idea of what they want to achieve and how their high school experience will contribute to that goal.

Additionally, having a career in mind can also help students to make more informed decisions about their coursework and extracurricular activities. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in business, they may choose to take more business-related courses and participate in business-related clubs or organizations.

However, despite the benefits of identifying a career early on, some students may put off deciding on a career for a variety of reasons. Some may feel unsure about their interests or may be hesitant to commit to a specific path. Others may simply be taking their time to explore different options and gain a better understanding of what they want to do.

While it is important for students to take their time and make informed decisions, it is also important to begin preparing for their desired career as early as possible. There are several steps that students can take during high school to become more prepared for their desired career, including:

1. Researching different career paths: Students can use resources such as career counseling services, online research, and informational interviews to learn more about different career paths and determine which one is the best fit for them.
2. Gaining relevant experience: Students can participate in internships, volunteer work, or part-time jobs in their desired field to gain practical experience and make connections in their industry.
3. Building a strong academic foundation: Students should focus on maintaining good grades and taking challenging courses in their desired field to demonstrate their commitment and dedication to their career goals.

While it is important for students to take these steps, it is also important to recognize the drawbacks of students deciding on a career late in their educational timeline. For example, students who wait until their senior year or later to decide on a career may have limited time to prepare and may struggle to gain the necessary experience and connections to succeed in their desired field.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"The differences between older and younger students have been researched extensively. Generally speaking, younger students tend to have higher intelligence levels, as they are still in the early stages of their development. However, older students may benefit from greater focus and maturity and may therefore be better prepared for tests. 

When it comes to school programs, differences between age groups depend largely on the school system itself. For example, most systems provide additional support for younger students, such as tutoring or mentoring, while older students may receive more advanced instruction. 

Despite the differences between age groups, there are many commonalities as well. Both younger and older students have the capacity to learn, grow, and succeed. And both groups must abide by the laws that govern student behavior and school performance.  Ultimately, while older and younger students may have different strengths and weaknesses, they both have the same goal: to maximize their own potential and achieve the best academic experience possible.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Graduating high school in three years rather than four has numerous advantages that should be explored and encouraged. For many students, graduating high school early not only reduces the amount of tuition costs required, but also provides them with an opportunity to get a jumpstart on their college education or pursue a job in their desired field of study. By beginning college or a career early, these students have the opportunity to start growing professionally and financially sooner, giving them a competitive advantage.

Furthermore, for students struggling with social or personal issues, graduating early can provide them with an opportunity to get away from what could be a difficult or unfulfilling four year high school experience. Finally, leaving high school early also provides students the opportunity to explore and develop new interests or travel abroad, which can be a very beneficial experience in terms of self-discovery and personal growth.

At the same time, graduating high school in three years can also come with significant challenges. For one thing, graduating early requires hard work and dedication, and high achieving students may have to work hard to maintain good grades and stay on track with their classes. Additionally, since three year graduation is not as common as four year graduation, those looking for scholarships or other forms of financial aid may find it more difficult to find adequate resources. 

Additionally, students may feel unprepared for the world that awaits them upon graduating high school early. Because these students graduate without having experienced all the traditional four year high school activities, they may miss out on a crucial part of a high school experience. 

Despite these challenges, graduating high school in three years should still be encouraged due to the numerous benefits associated with the process. By starting college or a career early, students can get a competitive edge, make social or personal progress, or explore new opportunities. As long as students are prepared to face the challenges ahead, graduating high school early can be an extremely beneficial decision.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"In his essay, Self-Reliance, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that ""nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind."" This is a statement about personal authenticity that reflects Emerson's belief that individuals should rely on themselves for guidance and trust their own decisions and actions. 

To improve knowledge and understanding of Algebra, the best activities involve practicing the subject. As an example, an algebra student may find resources online such as tutorials, practice worksheets and online websites that feature algebra problems with answers. Additionally, finding a tutor or enrolling in a class are other effective ways to develop knowledge of algebra.

Improving English language skills is best done through reading and writing. Reading materials such as newspapers, books, and magazines can help English learners become more familiar with the language while utilizing grammar and understanding syntax. Writing essays or articles and having peers evaluate grammar and usage also help immensely. 

To become a doctor, applicants must complete a four-year undergraduate degree, attend medical school, and complete a three- or four-year residency program. During the residency program, students will study under a mentor and should take various exams to be licensed to practice medicine.

Those looking for job opportunities to support family should assess their skills to help identify potential matches. Networking through websites and professional organizations can also help connect jobseekers to potential employers. Additionally, many local businesses post job opportunities in the community. 

Those seeking to challenge themselves for a better future can start by assessing their goals and priorities. Setting short-term and long-term goals can help create milestones in a lifetime plan. Additionally, finding mentors who have achieved the desired success can be beneficial, and networking through targeted contacts can provide essential assistance.

"Being a responsible employee is essential for success in the workplace. It involves taking ownership of one's actions, being accountable for mistakes, and consistently meeting deadlines. Responsible employees are also known for their attention to detail, ability to work well with others, and willingness to learn and grow.

One of the most significant benefits of being a responsible employee is the ability to achieve success. When employees are responsible for their work, they are more likely to take the necessary steps to ensure that their tasks are completed to the best of their ability. This often leads to higher quality work, which can result in greater success for the company.

Another benefit of being a responsible employee is the ability to work well with others. Responsible employees are known for their ability to communicate effectively, listen actively, and work collaboratively with their colleagues. This can lead to a more positive work environment, where employees feel valued and respected.

In addition to these benefits, responsible employees are also more likely to learn and grow in their jobs. When employees take ownership of their work, they are more likely to seek out opportunities to learn new skills and take on new challenges. This can lead to increased job satisfaction, as well as greater opportunities for career advancement.

Overall, being a responsible employee is essential for success in the workplace. By taking ownership of their actions, being accountable for mistakes, and consistently meeting deadlines, employees can achieve greater success, work well with others, and learn and grow in their jobs. It is important for employees to recognize the value of being responsible and to strive to be the best version of themselves in their work.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"The current school day is typically eight hours long, but there has been a growing trend of schools extending their day and adopting the four day work week model. This change has been proposed as a way to conserve energy and resources, but there are both advantages and disadvantages to consider.

On the one hand, extending the school day and adopting the four day work week model could have a positive impact on the environment. By reducing the number of days in a week, schools would be able to conserve energy and resources that are used to power the school. This could include reducing the amount of electricity used to power the lights and electronics in the school, as well as reducing the amount of water used for cleaning and other school operations.

Additionally, this change could have a positive impact on student learning. By having more time in the school day, students would be able to complete more work and have more time to ask questions and seek help from their teachers. This could lead to better academic performance and a more well-rounded education for students.

On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages to consider. One of the main concerns is the impact on students and their families. If schools were to extend their day and adopt the four day work week model, this would mean that students would be in school for longer hours each day. This could be difficult for some students and their families, as they may not be able to accommodate the new schedule.

Additionally, this change could have a negative impact on the school's budget. Extending the school day and adopting the four day work week model would require additional resources, including funding for staff and facilities. This could put a strain on the school's budget and make it difficult for the school to provide the same level of education and resources for students.

In conclusion, the idea of schools extending their day and adopting the four day work week model as a way to conserve energy and resources is an interesting one. While there are some advantages to consider, there are also some disadvantages that must be taken into account. Ultimately, it is up to schools and communities to carefully consider the pros and cons of this change and determine whether it is the right decision for their specific needs and circumstances.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"It is not uncommon for young teenagers to dream of a career and make the decision to pursue a specific career path in their teenage years. While there are some advantages to deciding on a career at an early age, there are some potential drawbacks that should be considered. 

The primary advantage of young teenagers choosing to pursue a career early is that it can give them a head start on their desired career. By starting earlier, teens can gain more experience, explore available options, and earn qualifications that can accelerate their progress. Teens who pursue this approach are also likely to have a greater clarity regarding their career choices when they become adults. 

However, there are some important disadvantages to young teenagers making the decision to pursue a specific career. One of the primary drawbacks is that, although teenagers may have a clear idea of what they want to do, they may not take into account any personal and professional changes that may occur as they enter adulthood. Additionally, teens can often become so focused on one career that they miss out on various other opportunities, especially if the chosen career path doesn’t work out. 

In conclusion, while deciding on a career path in teenage years can give young people a significant advantage, there are potential risks in making this decision too early. It is important for teens to consider their options carefully and think about the potential upsides and downsides before committing to a specific career path.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Completing science experiments in school can be an engaging and educational experience. Not only do students gain hands-on knowledge of varying scientific concepts, but they also discover how to use scientific techniques to reach a goal. But for some students, science experiments can be intimidating and can lead to a negative outlook on science and the laboratory. It's essential for students to remember to follow safety rules and protocols in order to get the most out of their experiments. Through careful observation and precise measurements, students can gain greater awareness of the scientific process. Far from simply studying the facts of science, science experiments can allow students to understand and appreciate scientific relationships in a deeper way. Not only can science enrich a student's intellectual capacity but also their school experience.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"As an 8th grader, I'm excited to learn about the differences between university and college courses for various career fields. My goal is to provide a comprehensive timeline and resources for students like me who are just starting to explore their options.

First, let's talk about the differences between university and college courses. University courses are typically more advanced and specialized, while college courses are more general and provide a broad foundation for various career fields. For example, a university course in engineering would delve deeper into the subject matter than a college course in the same field.

Next, let's make a list of college courses available for various career fields. Here are some examples:

* Business: marketing, finance, management, entrepreneurship
* Science: biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science
* Technology: computer science, software engineering, data analytics, cybersecurity
* Arts: graphic design, digital media, theater, music
* Healthcare: nursing, medicine, health administration, public health

Now, let's create a timeline for deciding on a college course or career path. Here are some steps to consider:

1. Research and explore different career fields and college courses in 9th grade.
2. Take relevant standardized tests (SAT, ACT, etc.) in 10th grade to prepare for college applications.
3. Apply to colleges and universities in 11th grade, considering factors like location, size, and course offerings.
4. Attend college fairs and tours to learn more about different colleges and their programs.
5. Visit college campuses and speak with current students and faculty in 12th grade to gain a better understanding of each college's culture and curriculum.
6. Make a final decision on a college course or career path after considering all factors.

To gather more information and insights, I plan to talk to students who have chosen a college course or career path. I will ask them about their experiences, what they enjoyed about their chosen path, and any challenges they faced. This will help me understand what to expect and how to make an informed decision.

Finally, let's discuss the resources available to students to help them choose a college course or career path.",1,llama2_chat,2
"When making decisions, it can be tempting to rely on the guidance of experts and authorities. However, there are important reasons why it is important to trust your own decision-making abilities. In this essay, I will explore the importance of trusting your own decision versus taking guidance from experts and authorities, examine the potential consequences of ignoring your own instincts and taking wrong decisions, assess the benefits of consulting family and other people before taking a decision, evaluate the idea of adhering to your parents’ decision versus taking your decision alone, and analyze the importance of taking your decision twice before proceeding with it.

Firstly, trusting your own decision-making abilities is important because it allows you to make decisions that are tailored to your own personal preferences and values. When you rely on the guidance of experts and authorities, you may be making decisions that are not aligned with your own beliefs and desires. This can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and regret in the long run. Additionally, trusting your own decision-making abilities can help you develop confidence in your abilities and increase your self-esteem.

Secondly, ignoring your own instincts and taking wrong decisions can have serious consequences. For example, if you make a decision that goes against your own values or beliefs, you may find yourself feeling unhappy and unfulfilled in the long run. Additionally, making decisions that are not well thought out can lead to negative outcomes, such as financial loss or damage to relationships. It is important to take the time to carefully consider your options and make decisions that align with your own personal preferences and values.

Thirdly, consulting family and other people before taking a decision can be beneficial. When you consult with others, you can gain different perspectives and insights that may not have been considered before. This can help you make more informed decisions and avoid potential pitfalls. Additionally, consulting with others can provide emotional support and help you feel more confident in your decision-making abilities.

Fourthly, adhering to your parents’ decision versus taking your decision alone can be a difficult decision. While it is important to respect your parents’ decisions and consider their input, it is also important to make decisions that align with your own personal preferences and values. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to make their own decisions and take responsibility for the consequences.

Finally, taking your decision twice before proceeding with it is important.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, I know this might sound kinda weird, but I really wanna talk about how important it is to follow your own passions in life, even if your family or friends are like, totally against it. 

I know, I know, it can be super hard to do what you want when the people you love are trying to hold you back. But, like, think about it. If you're doing something that makes you happy and fulfilled, doesn't that make life worth living? 

For instance, let's talk about pursuing a career in nursing. I know some people might be like, ""Oh my gosh, nursing is so boring and stressful!"" But, like, I think it's actually really cool!  You get to help people and make a difference in their lives, which is like, the best feeling ever! 

And, like, even if your family or friends don't think it's a good idea, if you're passionate about it, you should totally go for it!  It's your life, after all! 

Of course, it's not always easy. There might be obstacles and challenges along the way, but if you're truly passionate about something, you'll find a way to make it work. 

So, like, don't let anyone discourage you from following your dreams.  You got this!

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so like, after high school, there are a lot of different career options that we can choose from. It's kinda hard to decide though, cuz there are pros and cons to each one. Some people think it's better to make a decision early, but others think it's better to wait until after high school. So, I did some research to see what's up.

One of the pros of making a decision early is that you can start working towards your goal right away. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can start taking science classes in 9th grade and get a head start on college. That way, you can finish college faster and start working sooner. Plus, you can start gaining experience in your field by volunteering or getting internships. That way, when you do graduate, you'll be way more prepared for the real world.

But, there are also some cons to making a decision early. For one thing, you might not know what you want to do yet. Like, I'm not even sure if I want to go to college yet. And if you pick a career too early, you might end up hating it and wasting time and money. So, it's important to keep your options open and not make a final decision until you're sure.

On the other hand, waiting until after high school can be good too. For one thing, you can take a gap year and travel or volunteer or something. That way, you can get some real-world experience and figure out what you want to do. Plus, you can take more time to think about what you want to do and not rush into anything. And, you can take classes in different subjects to see what you're good at and what you like.

But, there are also some cons to waiting. For one thing, you might miss out on opportunities to get started on your career early. And, if you wait too long, you might not have enough time to finish college or get the experience you need. So, it's important to find a balance between taking your time and not waiting too long.

"In recent years, online classes have become increasingly popular, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While online classes offer many benefits, such as flexibility and convenience, there are also some drawbacks that make it difficult for students to learn effectively. In this essay, I will argue that some schools in the United States should not offer online classes for their students, as it can lead to harm and reduce their interaction with the real world.

One of the main reasons why online classes can be harmful is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. In traditional classroom settings, students have the opportunity to ask questions, receive feedback, and collaborate with their peers. However, in online classes, students may feel isolated and disconnected from their teachers and classmates. This can lead to decreased motivation and engagement, as well as a lack of accountability.

For example, a study by the University of California found that students who took online classes were more likely to drop out than those who took traditional classes. This is likely due to the lack of social interaction and support that students receive in online classes. Additionally, students who take online classes may struggle to stay on track with their studies, as there is no physical presence of a teacher or classmates to hold them accountable.

Another reason why online classes can be harmful is the potential for cheating and academic dishonesty. In traditional classroom settings, teachers can monitor students and ensure that they are not cheating. However, in online classes, it can be much easier for students to cheat on exams and assignments, as there is no physical presence of a teacher to monitor them. This can lead to a decrease in the value of education, as students may not be truly learning and developing the skills they need to succeed in the future.

Furthermore, online classes can reduce students' interaction with the real world. In traditional classroom settings, students have the opportunity to engage with the world around them, whether it be through field trips, service projects, or other extracurricular activities. However, in online classes, students may be less likely to engage with the real world, as there are no physical opportunities for them to do so. This can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the world around them, as well as a lack of development of important skills such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork.

"Technology has become an integral part of our lives in recent years. It has brought about numerous changes in the way we live, work, and interact with others. In this essay, I will discuss the positive effects of technology on people's lives, specifically focusing on how it helps people with accessing books, shopping, and playing games.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is its ability to provide people with easy access to information. With the advent of e-books, people can now easily download and read books from anywhere, anytime. This has made it easier for people to access a wide range of books, including those that are not available in physical bookstores. For example, a student who is studying for an exam can easily download textbooks and other relevant materials online. This has made it easier for people to learn and acquire knowledge.

Another way technology has helped people is by making shopping more convenient. With the rise of online shopping, people can now purchase goods and services from the comfort of their homes. This has made it easier for people to shop for groceries, clothes, and other items. For example, a busy professional can now order groceries online and have them delivered to their home. This has saved people a lot of time and effort.

Finally, technology has revolutionized the way people play games. With the rise of video games, people can now play games from anywhere, anytime. This has made it easier for people to play games with friends and family members from different parts of the world. For example, a group of friends can now play a multiplayer game online. This has made it easier for people to socialize and have fun.

In my opinion, technology has had a positive impact on people's lives. It has made it easier for people to access information, shop for goods and services, and play games. These activities have become more convenient and accessible, and people have been able to enjoy them from anywhere, anytime. However, it is important to note that technology should be used responsibly, and people should be mindful of its potential negative effects on their lives.

In conclusion, technology has brought about numerous changes in the way people live, work, and interact with others. It has made it easier for people to access information, shop for goods and services, and play games.

"Hey there! 

So, for our group project, we were tasked with comparing and contrasting the benefits of working in a group versus working alone. At first, I was like, ""Ugh, group projects are the worst!"" But then I realized, it's actually pretty cool to see how different people can bring their own ideas to the table and make something amazing together. 

First off, let's talk about working alone. Pros include being able to work at your own pace, no distractions, and total control over the project. Like, if you want to spend an entire weekend binge-watching Netflix and working on your project, you can do that!  But, cons include missing out on the creative input and brainstorming that comes with working in a group. Plus, it can be really hard to motivate yourself when you're working alone, and you might end up with a project that's just, like, meh. 

Now, let's talk about working in a group. Pros include the ability to bounce ideas off each other, get feedback and support, and create something way better than you could have on your own. Plus, it's way more fun!  Cons include potential conflicts and disagreements, and sometimes it can be hard to get everyone on the same page. But, like, the benefits are totally worth it. When you work in a group, you can create something that's truly amazing and innovative, like that one time we did a project on the effects of climate change and presented it to the whole school. 

So, in conclusion, working in a group and working alone both have their own advantages and disadvantages. But, like, when you work in a group, you can create something that's way better than anything you could have done alone.  It's all about finding that balance between individual creativity and collaborative effort.

"Life is full of challenges, and having a good attitude can make all the difference. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of having a good attitude and how it can improve various aspects of our lives, including work, relationships, and personal success.

Firstly, having a good attitude can greatly improve our mental and emotional well-being. A positive attitude can help us overcome obstacles, reduce stress, and increase our resilience. When we have a positive outlook on life, we are more likely to focus on the good things, rather than dwelling on negativity. This can lead to better mental health, improved relationships, and a more fulfilling life overall.

Secondly, having a good attitude can help us succeed in the workplace. A positive attitude can make us more productive, creative, and effective in our work. When we approach our work with a positive mindset, we are more likely to take on challenges, collaborate with others, and achieve our goals. In addition, a good attitude can help us build strong relationships with colleagues and superiors, leading to greater opportunities for career advancement.

Thirdly, having a good attitude can also improve our relationships and love life. When we have a positive attitude, we are more likely to attract and maintain healthy relationships. We are more open to new experiences and are more likely to approach relationships with a sense of curiosity and excitement. A good attitude can also help us navigate conflicts and challenges in our relationships, leading to stronger and more meaningful connections with others.

However, it's not always easy to maintain a positive attitude, especially when faced with adversity. Despite this, there are many well-known individuals who have achieved success in life despite having a disagreeable attitude. For example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was known for his intense and sometimes abrasive personality, but his vision and determination ultimately led to the success of the company. Similarly, Winston Churchill, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was known for his blunt and often controversial statements, but his leadership and determination helped Britain through some of its darkest days.

Finally, having a good attitude can also mean getting things easier in life. When we approach challenges with a positive mindset, we are more likely to see opportunities where others see only obstacles. This can lead to greater success in both our personal and professional lives. In",1,llammistral7binstruct,1

6. Analyze the drawbacks of working alone, such as lack of collaboration and limited perspective.
7. Provide examples of successful projects completed by both groups and individuals to illustrate the effectiveness of each approach.
8. Discuss the importance of effective communication and leadership skills in both group and individual work.
9. Offer recommendations for when to use each approach based on the project or assignment requirements and the individual strengths and weaknesses of the students.
10. Conclude by summarizing the key points and emphasizing the importance of considering the pros and cons of each approach when working on projects or assignments.

Working as a group or working alone has its own advantages and disadvantages. Both approaches can lead to successful outcomes, but they do so in different ways.

One of the biggest advantages of working as a group is the opportunity to meet new people and learn from each other. When working in a group, students are exposed to different perspectives and ideas, which can lead to more creative and innovative solutions. Additionally, working as a group allows students to divide work and complete projects faster, which can be particularly beneficial for time-sensitive assignments.

However, working alone also has its benefits. Working alone allows students to develop independence and self-reliance, which can be valuable skills in both academic and professional settings. Additionally, working alone allows students to focus on their own ideas and work at their own pace, which can be particularly beneficial for students who work best alone.

Ultimately, the most effective approach will depend on the project or assignment requirements and the individual strengths and weaknesses of the students. For example, a group project that requires collaboration and brainstorming may be more effective than working alone. On the other hand, an individual project that requires a high level of creativity and independence may be more effective than working as a group.

Effective communication and leadership skills are important in both group and individual work. In a group, strong communication skills are necessary to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal. Additionally, effective leadership skills are necessary to ensure that the group stays organized and on track. In individual work, strong communication skills are necessary to ensure that the student is able to effectively convey their ideas and receive feedback from their teacher or mentor.

"Setting goals and working hard to achieve them is one of the most effective strategies for success. Goals allow us to focus on specific areas of our lives we wish to improve and provide us with a roadmap for reaching those goals. By setting realistic goals and taking steps to reach them, we can move closer to our important pursuits.

Unfortunately, there are those who utilize deceit or unethical behavior to reach their aims. Lying and cheating can be very tempting, but the repercussions are often much greater than the short-term benefits. Many often forget that breaking the rules and pursuing their goals dishonestly can lead to serious consequences that include severe financial penalties, loss of reputation, and even incarceration.

In the end, it's important to remember that setting goals and working hard to achieve them is the most productive and reliable way to succeed. Despite the temptations of lying and cheating to reach our objectives, the long-term ramifications can be too costly for most people. A better strategy is to use our skills, time, and resources to create a plan that will sustain our success over the long term.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As an 8th grader, I think taking online classes from home can be really beneficial for high school students. One reason is that it allows them to learn at their own pace, which can be really helpful for students who might struggle with certain subjects or need extra time to understand the material. For example, my sister is in high school and she has an online class for math. She can take her time to work through the problems and ask her teacher for help when she needs it, which has really helped her improve her grades.

Another benefit of online classes is that they can provide more flexibility in terms of scheduling. Instead of having to attend classes at a specific time every day, students can log in and complete their work whenever it's convenient for them. This can be especially helpful for students who have a lot of other commitments, like sports or extracurricular activities. For instance, my friend is on the basketball team and he has to attend practice every day after school. With an online class, he can finish his work before practice and still have time to study for his other classes.

However, there are also some downsides to taking online classes. One of the biggest drawbacks is that students might not have as much face-to-face interaction with their teachers and classmates. This can make it harder for them to build relationships and get the support they need. For example, my cousin is in an online class and she says that she doesn't feel like she's getting as much help from her teacher as she would in a traditional classroom.

Another potential issue with online classes is that students might not have as much structure and accountability as they would in a traditional classroom. Without a set schedule and routine, students might find it harder to stay on track and complete their work. For instance, my brother is in an online class and he sometimes finds it hard to stay motivated and finish his work on time.

Overall, I think that taking online classes from home can be a good option for high school students, but it's important to weigh the pros and cons and consider what will work best for each individual student. For example, students who struggle with certain subjects or have a lot of other commitments might benefit from taking an online class, while students who thrive in a structured classroom environment might prefer a traditional classroom setting",1,llama2_chat,1

"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to consider the importance of committing to a career at a young age. While it may seem daunting to make a decision about one's future at such a young age, it is crucial to start thinking about it early on in order to make the most of one's education and opportunities.

One of the ways that schools can play a role in helping students realize the importance of committing to a career is by providing guidance and resources to help students explore and understand different career paths. This can include career counseling, job shadowing, and internships, which can give students a better understanding of what their chosen career entails and whether it is the right fit for them.

Additionally, committing to a career can prepare students for their adult life in a number of ways. Firstly, it can help students stay focused and motivated, as they will have a clear goal in mind and be able to work towards it. This can lead to better academic performance and a greater sense of purpose. Secondly, it can help students make informed decisions about their education and career path, as they will have a better understanding of what they want to achieve and how to get there. Finally, it can help students develop important skills such as time management, budgeting, and problem-solving, which will be valuable in any career.

Another way that setting goals can help students stay focused on their career is by providing a clear roadmap for achieving their desired outcomes. By setting specific, measurable, and achievable goals, students can break down their long-term career aspirations into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help them stay on track and make steady progress towards their goals. Additionally, setting goals can help students develop a sense of self-discipline and perseverance, as they will need to work hard and overcome obstacles in order to achieve their goals.

However, it is important to establish the importance of giving students enough time to come up with an ideal career choice. While it may be tempting to rush into a decision, it is important to take the time to carefully consider one's options and make an informed decision. This can involve researching different career paths, talking to people in various fields, and gaining practical experience through internships and other opportunities. By taking the time to carefully consider their options, students can make a more informed and",1,llammistral7binstruct,0

"Attitudes play a crucial role in determining a person's success in life. They are the thoughts and beliefs that shape our perceptions, behaviors, and decision-making processes. Attitudes can be positive or negative, and they can be influenced by various factors, including upbringing, experiences, and environment.

A positive attitude is essential for success in life. People with a positive attitude tend to have a can-do mindset, which enables them to overcome challenges and seize opportunities. They believe in their abilities, and they are more likely to take risks and pursue their goals. Research has shown that people with a positive attitude tend to have better mental and physical health, higher levels of job satisfaction, and more significant financial success.

On the other hand, a negative attitude can hinder a person's success in life. People with a negative attitude tend to have a pessimistic mindset, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and defeatism. They may believe that they are not capable of achieving their goals or that they are doomed to fail. This mindset can lead to procrastination, lack of motivation, and poor decision-making.

A person's upbringing can significantly influence their attitudes towards life. Parents and caregivers play a critical role in shaping a child's attitudes by providing a supportive and nurturing environment. They teach children to believe in themselves, to persevere through challenges, and to have a positive outlook on life. Children who grow up in a positive and supportive environment are more likely to develop a positive attitude towards life.

However, a person's upbringing can also contribute to a negative attitude. Children who grow up in an abusive or neglectful environment may develop a negative attitude towards life. They may learn to believe that they are not capable of achieving their goals or that they are doomed to fail. This mindset can carry over into adulthood, leading to a life of struggle and hardship.

In conclusion, attitudes play a crucial role in determining a person's success in life. A positive attitude is essential for success, while a negative attitude can hinder it. A person's upbringing can significantly influence their attitudes towards life, and it is crucial for parents and caregivers to provide a supportive and nurturing environment to help children develop",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Sure, I'd be happy to write an essay as an 8th grade student! Here it is:

Hey, guys! Today we're learning about plays and how to become a successful actor. I think it's really cool because I love acting! I've been in a few school plays before, and it's so much fun. You get to dress up, memorize lines, and perform in front of a crowd. It's like a big show!

So, there are different roles and activities involved in being in a play. Like, you can be an actor, which is the person who acts out the character. Or you can be a stagehand, who helps set up the sets and costumes. Or you can be a director, who decides how the play will look and feel. It's like a big team effort!

To become a successful actor, you gotta do a lot of research. You can watch movies and TV shows, read books and plays, and even take acting classes. You gotta learn how to act like different people and how to deliver lines. It's like a big challenge!

But, you know what? Acting can also be really helpful in life. Like, it can help you learn how to express yourself and how to work with others. It can also help you deal with nerves and anxiety. When I'm acting, I feel like I can be anyone and do anything!

"Title: The Benefits of a School Program That Pairs Older and Younger Students

Introduction

As an eighth-grade student, I have experienced the benefits of a school program that pairs older and younger students. This program, also known as peer mentoring, has been shown to have numerous advantages for both the older and younger students involved. In this essay, I will research the effects of this program, explain the benefits to both the older and younger students, describe my personal experiences with the pairing program in school, and summarize the advantages of the program and the importance of kindness and cooperation.

The Benefits of Peer Mentoring for Older Students

One of the main benefits of peer mentoring for older students is that it helps to improve their leadership skills. By pairing older students with younger ones, they are given the opportunity to take on a leadership role and help guide their younger peers. This not only helps to build their confidence but also teaches them valuable communication and problem-solving skills. Additionally, peer mentoring can also help older students to develop a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their education. By helping their younger peers, they can see the impact that their actions can have and feel a sense of pride in their contributions.

The Benefits of Peer Mentoring for Younger Students

For younger students, peer mentoring can be a valuable resource for learning and growth. By pairing them with older students, they are given access to a wealth of knowledge and experience that they may not otherwise have the opportunity to gain. Additionally, peer mentoring can also help younger students to develop social skills and build relationships with their peers. By working with an older student, they can learn how to communicate effectively and navigate social situations in a safe and supportive environment.

Personal Experiences with Peer Mentoring

As an eighth-grade student, I have been involved in a peer mentoring program at my school. My experience has been incredibly rewarding, both for me and for my mentee. Through this program, I have been able to share my knowledge and experience with a younger student, while also learning from them in return. This has been a valuable opportunity for me to develop my leadership skills and build a strong relationship with someone who is a few years younger than me.

"conclusion summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early and working before college, and offer recommendations on how students can make the most of their time before college.

Advantages of Graduating Early and Working Before College

Graduating early from high school and working for one year before going to college has several advantages. Firstly, it allows students to save money for college. By working for a year, students can earn a significant amount of money that can be used to pay for tuition, books, and other expenses. This can be especially beneficial for students who come from low-income families or who have a lot of student loan debt.

Secondly, working before college can help students become more mature. High school can be a challenging time for many students, and working for a year can provide a sense of responsibility and independence. This can help students develop the skills they need to succeed in college and beyond.

Finally, working before college can help students develop time management skills. Many students struggle with time management in college, and working for a year can help them develop the skills they need to be successful. This can include skills such as prioritizing tasks, setting deadlines, and managing their time effectively.

Importance of Time Management Skills in College

Time management skills are crucial in college. Students often have to balance their coursework, extracurricular activities, and work responsibilities. Without strong time management skills, students can struggle to keep up with their workload and achieve their goals.

Time management skills can also help students develop better study habits. By prioritizing tasks and setting deadlines, students can focus on their studies and avoid procrastination. This can lead to better grades and a more successful academic career.

Counterargument: Negatives of Graduating Early and Working Before College

While there are many advantages to graduating early and working before college, there are also potential negatives. One potential negative is that students may not be ready for the rigors of college. High school can be challenging, but college can be even more demanding. Students who graduate early and work before college may not have the same level of preparation as their peers who graduate on time and go directly to college.

Another potential negative is that students may not have the same opportunities as their peers who go directly to college. Many colleges offer scholarships, grants,",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"When it comes to deciding whether to take college classes or enter the military at an early age, it is important for students to consider all of their options and make an informed decision. While a quick decision may seem like the best option, rushing into a decision often leads to regrets in the long run. Elective courses offer students a way to express their interests and figure out what they truly desire. 

Through elective courses, students are able to explore different topics and open themselves to new possibilities. These courses offer a chance to learn about diverse areas, including the arts, American history, and science. By trying out different courses, students can deepen their understanding of their preferred subject and gain an insight into potential future paths. 

In addition, elective courses can provide a new perspective on the complex world around us. By taking elective courses outside of a student's comfort zone, they can gain vital skills such as creativity and problem-solving. As a result, students will be better prepared for whatever career they plan to pursue. 

To sum up, students should not rush into deciding which college classes to take or enter the military at an early age. Elective courses provide students with the opportunity to explore their interests and learn what they truly desire, gain knowledge on diverse topics, and gain valuable skill sets. Ultimately, taking the time to evaluate all of one's options is key to making an informed decision.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an 8th grader, I believe that researching successful people and their stories is an excellent way to gain inspiration and guidance in creating my own future. By learning about their struggles, achievements, and decision-making processes, I can gain valuable insights into how they were able to reach their goals and how I can apply those lessons to my own life.

For example, I find myself drawn to entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, who were able to turn their passions into successful businesses despite facing numerous obstacles along the way. Their stories show me that with hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks, I can pursue my own dreams and make them a reality.

At the same time, I also believe that it's important to create my own ideas based on my own life experiences and instincts. While researching successful people can provide valuable guidance, I know that my own unique perspective and experiences are what will ultimately shape my future. By trusting my instincts and following my passions, I can create a path that is truly my own.

Of course, making decisions is never easy, and there are always potential drawbacks to consider. Before making a decision, I like to weigh the benefits and drawbacks carefully, thinking through all the possible outcomes and how they might affect my life. This helps me make informed choices that align with my goals and values.

Finally, I believe that collecting as much life experience as possible is crucial for making informed decisions in the future. By trying new things, meeting new people, and exploring new places, I can broaden my horizons and gain a deeper understanding of the world around me. This will help me make better decisions and live a more fulfilling life.

Overall, I believe that staying confident in myself and my decisions is essential for achieving success in life. By trusting my instincts and believing in myself, I can overcome any obstacle and reach my full potential. With hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks, I know that I can create a bright and fulfilling future for myself.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Working in a group can be a great way for students to connect, communicate, and collaborate on school projects. There are several advantages to working in a group. People in a group can draw on the skills and knowledge of multiple people to reach a solution or understanding. Furthermore, the collective effort can boost motivation and help to ensure that projects are completed in a timely fashion. Additionally, strong group dynamics can help foster creativity and encourage diverse perspectives when discussing a problem.

However, working in a group also has several drawbacks. Group members may not have the same commitment level or work ethic, which can result in project delays, task imbalances, and conflict. Additionally, it can be difficult to make everyone feel included and heard, especially when there are a diverse range of personalities in the group. 

Despite these challenges, group work can still be beneficial for students. Working in a group on school projects can help students gain a better understanding of the subject by providing multiple perspectives and opportunities for collaboration. By properly harnessing the sense of motivation and diversity created in the group, students can more effectively reach their learning goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey, so I have to write an essay about whether or not music, drama, and art classes should be compulsory for students. I think it's pretty cool that I get to share my thoughts on this, even though I'm only in 8th grade. 😅

So, let's start with the pros of making these classes compulsory. First of all, it can help students develop their creativity and imagination. I mean, who doesn't love doodling in class or singing in the shower?! But seriously, learning to express ourselves through art and music can be super beneficial for our mental health and overall well-being. It can also help us develop our critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. Like, if we're learning to play an instrument, we have to think about rhythm, melody, and timing, which can be pretty challenging. 🎸

Another pro is that these classes can bring people together and create a sense of community. Like, imagine being in a choir or drama club with your friends – it's a great way to bond and make new friends. And who doesn't love performing in front of an audience?! 🎭 Plus, these classes can help us develop our social skills and learn how to work together towards a common goal.

But, there are also some cons to making these classes compulsory. For one thing, it can be really boring and uninteresting for some students. Like, if you're not into music or drama, then being forced to take these classes can be a real drag. And two, it can be hard to fit everything into our schedules. I mean, we already have so much homework and tests and stuff, so adding more classes to our plates can be overwhelming. 📚

In my opinion, I think that making music, drama, and art classes compulsory can be beneficial, but only if they're taught in a way that's engaging and fun for everyone. Like, if we're learning about rhythm and melody, we should be able to play instruments and sing together as a class. And if we're learning about different art styles, we should be able to create our own art projects and share them with",1,llama2_chat,3
"Success is a topic that has been debated for years. Some people believe that success is achieved through a number of failures, while others believe that success can be achieved without the experience of failure. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and present my own opinion on what constitutes success.

On the one hand, proponents of the ""failure is the key to success"" argument believe that experiencing failure is essential for achieving success. They argue that failure teaches us valuable lessons and helps us develop resilience and perseverance. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed over 1,000 times before finally inventing the light bulb. Without these failures, he may not have been able to come up with the innovative design that ultimately led to his success.

Furthermore, some argue that failure can be a motivator. When we fail, we may become more determined to succeed in the future. This determination can lead to hard work, which can ultimately lead to success. Additionally, failure can help us identify areas where we need to improve, which can lead to growth and development.

On the other hand, opponents of the ""failure is the key to success"" argument believe that success can be achieved without the experience of failure. They argue that success is often a result of hard work, dedication, and determination, rather than failure. For example, many successful people, such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, did not experience significant failures before achieving success.

Furthermore, some argue that failure can be a distraction from success. When we focus too much on avoiding failure, we may not be able to focus on the things that truly matter, such as achieving our goals and making a positive impact on the world.

In my opinion, success is a combination of both failure and hard work. While failure can be a valuable lesson and a motivator, it is not the only path to success. Hard work, dedication, and determination are also crucial components of achieving success.

For example, consider the story of Michael Jordan. While he experienced many failures early in his career, he was also known for his hard work and dedication to his craft. He spent countless hours practicing and perfecting his skills, which ultimately led to his success as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

In conclusion, while failure can be a valuable lesson",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Title: The Power of Character Traits: How Our Choices Shape Who We Are and Who We Surround Ourselves With

Hey there, it's me, an average 8th grader, here to write about the fascinating topic of character traits and how they are influenced by our choices and surroundings. As I dug deeper into this topic, I realized that it's not just about being influenced by others, but also about how our mindset and motivations shape who we are and the people we surround ourselves with.

According to John Lubbock, a British philosopher and polymath, ""Our character is not something fixed, but is something that can be developed and improved."" This quote resonates with me because it shows that we have the power to shape our own character traits and that it's never too late to make positive changes in our lives.

Our mindset plays a huge role in shaping our character traits. If we have a positive mindset, we are more likely to be optimistic, resilient, and open to new experiences. On the other hand, if we have a negative mindset, we may become pessimistic, anxious, and resistant to change. As I learned from my own experiences, having a positive mindset can make a world of difference in how we approach challenges and how we interact with others.

Moreover, the people we surround ourselves with can also shape our character traits. The saying ""show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are"" is so true because the people we spend time with can influence our values, beliefs, and behaviors. If we surround ourselves with people who are supportive, encouraging, and positive, we are more likely to develop good character traits. On the other hand, if we surround ourselves with people who are negative and toxic, it can have a damaging effect on our character.

Another important aspect of character traits is the decisions and actions we take. The choices we make every day can lead to positive or negative outcomes, and these outcomes can shape our character traits. For instance, if we consistently make choices that are kind, compassionate, and honest, we are more likely to develop good character traits like empathy",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey there!  So, you know how people are always like, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" And you're like, ""Uh, idk.""  Well, I'm here to tell you that it's totally fine if you don't know yet! 

First things first, let's talk about career options.  There are like, a million things you can be when you grow up!  But seriously, there are so many cool careers out there. You can be a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, a scientist, an artist, a musician... the list goes on and on! 

Now, the next question is, how do you figure out what you want to be?  Well, one way is to explore different career paths. Like, maybe you're really into science, so you take some science classes in high school. Or maybe you're more into the arts, so you join the drama club or start painting. 

Another thing you can do is set some goals for yourself.  Like, maybe you want to get good grades in math and science so you can be an engineer. Or maybe you want to learn a new language so you can be a translator. 

And guess what? Taking classes in high school can help you prepare for your chosen career!  Like, if you want to be a doctor, you can take biology and chemistry classes to get a head start. Or if you want to be a teacher, you can take English and history classes to learn how to communicate and teach others. 

But wait, there's more!  You don't have to figure everything out in high school.  It's totally fine if you change your mind a few times. Like, maybe you'll take a class and be like, ""Oh, I love this! I want to be a scientist!"" And then you take another class and be like, ""Nah, I want",1,llama2_chat,3
"Hey there!  So, I was like, thinking about how we can influence other people, you know? And I was like, ""Hmmm, how do we do that?"" And then I was like, ""Oh, I get it!"" 

So, let's talk about talking to someone about their experience. Like, if someone's going through a tough time or something, we can totally talk to them about it and help them feel better. It's like, super important to be there for them and listen to what they have to say. And if we're like, really good listeners, they'll be like, ""Thanks, man! You're the best!"" 

But then there's also talking softly and calmly about someone's behavior. Like, if someone's doing something that's not cool, we can talk to them about it in a nice way. It's like, we don't want to be mean or anything, but we also don't want them to keep doing something that's not good for them or for us. So, we can be like, ""Hey, can we talk about this? I'm worried about you."" And they'll be like, ""Oh, okay. Yeah, I didn't realize that."" 

So, the consequences of both methods are kind of different. If we talk to someone about their experience, they might feel better and more supported. But if we talk softly and calmly about their behavior, they might change their ways and be a better person. Or, like, they might not even care and keep doing whatever they're doing. 

Anyway, it's important to think about how we can influence other people. We don't want to be mean or anything, but we also want to help them out if they're in a tough spot. So, we should like, try to find the right balance and be supportive and stuff. 

That's my essay! I hope you liked it!  Let me know if you have any questions or need to know more!",1,llama2_chat,0
"Dear Professor,

I am writing to argue for the need to change the school menu in order to improve student health and academic performance. While some may argue that the current menu is sufficient, I believe that there are several reasons why it should be changed.

Firstly, the current school menu often lacks nutritious options. Many students are forced to choose between unhealthy options such as pizza and fries, or go hungry. This is not only unhealthy, but it can also negatively impact academic performance. Studies have shown that students who eat a healthy diet are more likely to perform better academically.

Secondly, the school menu can be expensive. Many students come from low-income families and cannot afford to pay for the more expensive options. This can lead to students going hungry or choosing less healthy options. By offering more affordable options, we can ensure that all students have access to nutritious meals.

Finally, the school menu can be monotonous. Many students get bored with the same options day in and day out. This can lead to students skipping meals or choosing unhealthy options. By offering a wider variety of options, we can ensure that students are more likely to eat a healthy and balanced diet.

In conclusion, changing the school menu is crucial for the health and academic performance of students. By offering more nutritious, affordable, and varied options, we can ensure that all students have access to the food they need to succeed.

For example, at my school, we have recently implemented a new menu that includes more healthy options such as salads and whole grains. This has been well received by students and has led to a decrease in the number of students skipping meals. Additionally, many schools have implemented ""lunch and learn"" programs where students can learn about nutrition and healthy eating while enjoying their lunch.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that changing the school menu is necessary for the health and academic performance of students. By offering more nutritious, affordable, and varied options, we can ensure that all students have access to the food they need to succeed.

"""Determine never to be idle"" is a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, and it is a valuable saying that resonates with today’s society, where it often feels like there is not enough time in the day for all we need to do. How can we as a society apply this quote and reduce our collective idleness? By committing ourselves to utilizing every moment to the best of our abilities, we can ensure that our time and energy are being used in an effective and productive way. 

For instance, one individual who was determined not to be idle was Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard but still managed to create one of the most successful and recognizable technology companies in history. Instead of wasting his time being idle, Gates used his ambition and determination to create something meaningful with his time, and today his success serves as an example for others.

Those who are idle and think that inactivity serves a purpose are not only not determined to better their lives, but they are also not planning for the future. This means that a lack of passion can lead to stunted intellectual growth and missed opportunities. By actively pushing ourselves to use our time and resources to their fullest potential, we can boost our creativity, experiences, and futures.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that having a positive attitude is a crucial factor in achieving success. A positive attitude can help us overcome challenges and setbacks, and it can also help us stay motivated and focused on our goals.

One of the main reasons why having a positive attitude is important is that it can help us overcome challenges and setbacks. When we face obstacles, it's easy to become discouraged and give up. But if we have a positive attitude, we can approach these challenges with a sense of optimism and determination. For example, if we're struggling to pass a class, we might become frustrated and feel like giving up. But if we have a positive attitude, we can remind ourselves that we're capable of success and that we can overcome this challenge.

Another reason why having a positive attitude is important is that it can help us stay motivated and focused on our goals. When we have a positive attitude, we're more likely to believe in ourselves and our abilities. This can help us stay motivated and focused on our goals, even when things get tough. For example, if we're trying to save up for a new car, we might become discouraged if we don't make as much money as we hoped. But if we have a positive attitude, we can remind ourselves that we're making progress and that we're one step closer to our goal.

Finally, having a positive attitude can help us build better relationships with others. When we have a positive attitude, we're more likely to be friendly and approachable. This can help us build better relationships with our friends, family, and coworkers. For example, if we're in a group project at school, we might become frustrated with our teammates if they're not contributing as much as they should be. But if we have a positive attitude, we can approach the situation with kindness and understanding, and we might be able to work together more effectively.

In conclusion, I believe that having a positive attitude is a crucial factor in achieving success. A positive attitude can help us overcome challenges and setbacks, stay motivated and focused on our goals, and build better relationships with others. So, if you want to achieve success in any aspect of your life, I encourage you to cultivate a positive attitude and keep it with you at all times.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Self-esteem and achievement are closely connected, as one heavily influences the other. An individual with high self-esteem believes they are capable of succeeding in different areas of life, often resulting in demonstrable achievements. On the other hand, achieving success can boost an individual's self-esteem. High self-esteem increases motivation, as individuals with a greater sense of self-worth are more eager and willing to face challenges and take on more difficult tasks in pursuit of their goals. Furthermore, having confidence in one's ability to achieve can lead to increased resilience when faced with failure. Instead of backing down from a challenge, individuals with higher self-esteem are more likely to persevere and continue to strive for success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  I'm so pumped to be writing this essay about community service.  I know, I know, it's not the most exciting topic, but hear me out.

So, here's the thing: our school and community are super important, and keeping them clean is, like, a total must. But let's be real, sometimes we don't always do the best job of taking care of them.  Like, have you seen the trash in the hallway?  It's like, gross.

So, here's my plan: every student in our school should have to do community service once a month.  Like, imagine it – we'd all be out there picking up trash, planting trees, and volunteering at local charities. It would be so cool! 

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But, ugh, community service is so boring!""  But trust me, it's not. It's actually really fun!  Plus, it's like, good for us. It teaches us important skills, like teamwork and responsibility.  And it's not like we're asking for a ton of time – just one day a month.  That's it!

And think about it – if we all do our part, we could make a huge difference.  Like, imagine if every student in our school was picking up trash in the park on the same day.  It would be so clean and beautiful! 

Of course, there are some logistics to figure out.  Like, who would organize everything? And how would we make sure everyone gets the chance to participate?  But I'm sure we could figure it out. 

So, what do you think, Mrs. Johnson?  Do you think requiring community service could be a good idea?  Let me",1,llama2_chat,4
"The debate over whether schools should control their students' involvement in extracurricular activities is an important one. On one hand, it is beneficial for schools to regulate and monitor students extracurricular involvement, as it allows for better oversight of educational institutions as a whole, and ensures that students are taking part in activities that align with the school's values. On the other hand, some believe that restricting students involvement in extracurricular activities can stifle creativity and expression, and that it can lead to feelings of burnout and resentment. 

In order to find the best solution, we must take both perspectives into consideration. On the one hand, there is value in providing guidelines and oversight for students extracurricular activities so that students remain safe and get the most out of their activities. On the other hand, an overly restrictive environment can have an adverse effect, as students may feel that their choices are limited or unfairly controlled. 

Therefore, it is essential for schools to focus on providing students with guidance and advice rather than strict control. Setting positive expectations of behavior, providing meaningful and relevant activities and mentors, and making sure that students have ample time for rest and relaxation are all important components of introducing an effective balance between school life and extracurricular activities. By providing clear support and guidance, schools can ensure that their students get the most out of their extracurricular experiences while managing to remain safe and productive.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote has resonated with many people throughout history, and it is a message that holds true today. In this essay, I will explore the importance of failure in achieving success, using examples from both historical figures and personal experiences.

Firstly, it is important to understand that failure is a natural part of life. It is something that everyone experiences at some point, whether it be in school, work, or personal relationships. However, it is not the end of the world. In fact, failure can be a valuable learning experience that can ultimately lead to success.

One example of this is the story of Thomas Edison. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb, but it took him over 1,000 attempts to get it right. Each time he failed, he learned from his mistakes and used that knowledge to improve his design. Eventually, his persistence paid off and he was able to successfully invent the light bulb.

Another example is the story of J.K. Rowling. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected by multiple publishers before finally being accepted. However, instead of giving up, Rowling continued to write and eventually published the book herself. The book became a massive success and Rowling went on to become one of the most successful authors of all time.

Personally, I have experienced failure in my own life. I have failed exams, failed at relationships, and failed at achieving certain goals. However, each time I failed, I learned from my mistakes and used that knowledge to improve myself. Eventually, I was able to overcome those failures and achieve success.

In conclusion, failure is an essential part of life and can ultimately lead to success. It is important to view failure as a learning experience and to use that knowledge to improve ourselves. By doing so, we can achieve great things and make a positive impact on the world.

Overall, Winston Churchill's quote is a powerful reminder that failure is not the end of the world. It is a valuable learning experience that can ultimately lead to success. By embracing failure and using it as a stepping stone to success, we can achieve great things and make a positive impact on the world.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"After school clubs are an excellent way to help students improve their academic achievement. These clubs provide a safe and supportive environment where students can learn, grow, and develop new skills. In this essay, I will discuss some ways to help improve student achievement in after school clubs, including the advantages to students and teachers participating, and how the after school club environment can bring about a positive impact.

One way to help improve student achievement in after school clubs is by providing opportunities for students to engage in hands-on activities. For example, science clubs can conduct experiments, art clubs can create projects, and technology clubs can build and program robots. These activities allow students to apply what they have learned in class and develop practical skills that will be useful in the future. Additionally, these activities can help students develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

Another way to help improve student achievement in after school clubs is by providing opportunities for students to work collaboratively with their peers. For example, debate clubs can practice public speaking and argumentation skills, and drama clubs can work together to create a performance. These collaborative activities can help students develop teamwork skills, communication skills, and leadership skills. Additionally, these activities can help students build strong relationships with their peers and develop a sense of community.

Participating in after school clubs can also have advantages for teachers. For example, teachers can use these clubs as an opportunity to provide additional support to students who may be struggling academically. Additionally, teachers can use these clubs to develop new teaching strategies and techniques. For example, a science teacher may use a science club to experiment with different teaching methods and assess student learning.

The after school club environment can also bring about a positive impact on student achievement. For example, after school clubs can provide a safe and supportive environment where students can feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. Additionally, after school clubs can provide a break from the rigors of the school day and give students a chance to relax and recharge. This can help students come back to class more focused and motivated.

In conclusion, after school clubs are an excellent way to help improve student achievement. Providing opportunities for hands-on activities, collaborative activities, and additional support from teachers can all contribute to student success. Additionally, the after school club environment can provide a positive impact on student achievement by providing a safe and supportive environment where students can feel comfortable asking questions and making",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Online courses are a pretty new thing, and I think they're pretty cool. I mean, you can learn stuff from the comfort of your own home! No more getting up early for school, no more dealing with annoying classmates, and no more boring teachers. But are they really better than regular classes? I'm gonna try to figure that out.

First, let's talk about the advantages of online courses. One of the biggest advantages is flexibility. You can take an online course whenever you want, as long as you have a computer and internet. That's super helpful for people who have busy schedules or who live in different time zones. You can also learn at your own pace, which means you can take breaks whenever you need to and go back to a lesson whenever you want. That's really helpful for people who have trouble paying attention in class or who need to re-watch stuff a bunch of times before they get it.

Another advantage of online courses is that they're usually cheaper than regular classes. Like, way cheaper. You don't have to pay for transportation or lunch or anything, so you can save a lot of money. That's really cool for people who can't afford to go to school or who live in places where there aren't a lot of schools. Plus, you can usually take online courses from anywhere in the world, so you can learn from experts who are way smarter than your teachers.

But there are also some disadvantages to online courses. One of the biggest disadvantages is that you don't get to see your teachers or classmates in person. That can be really lonely, especially if you're a social person. You also don't get to ask questions or talk to your teachers in real time, which can make it harder to learn stuff. And sometimes, the videos or lectures can be really boring or hard to follow, which can make it hard to pay attention.

Now, let's compare online courses to seven-hour education courses. Seven-hour courses are like regular classes, but they're longer. They're usually taught by teachers who are really good at teaching, and you get to ask questions and talk to your teachers in real time. That can be really helpful for people who have trouble learning stuff on their",1,llama2_chat,4
"Albert Schweitzer was a German-French physician and humanitarian who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1951 for his work in promoting peace and humanitarian aid. Throughout his life, Schweitzer was a strong advocate for personal conduct as the best way to influence others. In this essay, I will argue that his opinion is valid and that personal conduct is the most effective way to influence others.

Firstly, Schweitzer's personal conduct was exemplary. He was known for his dedication to his patients and his commitment to providing them with the best possible care. He worked tirelessly to improve the medical practices of his time, and his work in developing new techniques and treatments had a profound impact on the field of medicine.

Secondly, Schweitzer's personal conduct had a ripple effect on those around him. His patients and colleagues were inspired by his dedication and commitment to his work. They saw the positive impact that his personal conduct had on his patients and were motivated to follow his example. This led to a culture of compassion and care in the medical community, which has continued to influence the way that doctors and nurses approach their work today.

Furthermore, Schweitzer's personal conduct also had a wider impact on society. His work in promoting peace and humanitarian aid inspired others to follow in his footsteps. His advocacy for the rights of the poor and oppressed helped to bring attention to these issues and led to significant changes in policy and legislation.

In conclusion, Albert Schweitzer's opinion on personal conduct being the best way to influence others is valid. His exemplary personal conduct had a profound impact on those around him and helped to create a culture of compassion and care in the medical community. Furthermore, his advocacy for peace and humanitarian aid inspired others to follow in his footsteps and led to significant changes in society.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Advantages and Disadvantages of Advanced Learning Experience

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a more advanced learning experience can have both advantages and disadvantages. While it can lead to a better career experience, it can also have negative impacts on human society.

On the one hand, advanced learning experiences can provide students with a competitive edge in the job market. Graduating early from high school or college can lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries. Additionally, students who take advanced classes may have access to scholarships and other financial aid opportunities, which can help them achieve their goals.

On the other hand, advanced learning experiences can have negative impacts on human society. For example, if only a select few have access to these experiences, it can create a divide between those who have them and those who do not. This can lead to a lack of diversity and inclusivity in the workplace and in society as a whole. Additionally, if students are pressured to take advanced classes in order to succeed, it can lead to burnout and a lack of enjoyment in the learning process.

In conclusion, while advanced learning experiences can have advantages, it is important to consider the potential disadvantages as well. It is important to ensure that these experiences are accessible to all students and that they are not used to create a divide in society. Additionally, students should be encouraged to take advantage of pre-AP classes and other opportunities, but not to the point where they are pressured to the point of burnout.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that extending the school day and having four days of school has both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it can provide more opportunities for learning and academic success, but on the other hand, it can lead to burnout and reduced mental health.

One of the main benefits of having a longer school day and four days of school is that it can provide more time for learning and academic success. With more time in the classroom, students can receive more instruction, practice, and feedback on their work. This can lead to improved grades, test scores, and overall academic performance. Additionally, having more time in the classroom can also help students catch up on any missed work or material, allowing them to stay on track and avoid falling behind.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to extending the school day and having four days of school. One of the main concerns is that it can lead to burnout and reduced mental health. With more time in the classroom, students may feel overwhelmed and stressed, leading to decreased motivation and engagement in their studies. Additionally, having four days of school can be mentally exhausting, leading to reduced productivity and academic performance.

Another potential drawback is that it can also have a negative impact on extracurricular activities and personal time. With more time in the classroom, students may have less time for extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs, which can be an important part of their overall development and well-being. Additionally, having four days of school can limit the amount of personal time that students have, which can be important for maintaining relationships and pursuing personal interests.

In conclusion, extending the school day and having four days of school has both advantages and disadvantages. While it can provide more opportunities for learning and academic success, it can also lead to burnout and reduced mental health, as well as negatively impact extracurricular activities and personal time. Ultimately, the decision to extend the school day and have four days of school should be carefully considered, taking into account the potential benefits and drawbacks for students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Making confident decisions is an essential skill that everyone should possess. It is the ability to make choices with conviction and clarity, knowing that the decision made is the best possible one for the given situation. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of seeking advice from friends, family, or counselors, ways to trust one's own judgement when making decisions, and the importance of developing good decision-making skills in youth.

Seeking advice from friends, family, or counselors can be incredibly beneficial when making decisions. It allows for a different perspective on the situation, which can lead to a better decision. It is essential to surround oneself with people who have experience and knowledge in the area of decision-making. They can provide valuable insights and advice that can help guide the decision-making process. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential consequences of the decision, and seeking advice can help identify potential risks and challenges.

Trusting one's own judgement when making decisions is also essential. It is important to have confidence in one's own abilities and to trust one's own instincts. It is important to consider all available information, weigh the pros and cons, and make a decision based on what is best for the situation. Trusting one's own judgement can lead to a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in the decision-making process.

Developing good decision-making skills in youth is crucial for success in the future. It is essential to learn how to make decisions that are based on sound reasoning and critical thinking. It is important to consider all available information and to make decisions that are ethical and moral. Developing good decision-making skills in youth can lead to success in all areas of life, including personal relationships, career, and academics.

The impact of good decision-making can be seen in one's life, future, and family. It can lead to a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in life. It can also lead to success in the future, whether it is in personal relationships, career, or academics. Additionally, good decision-making can have a positive impact on one's family. It can lead to a stronger and more cohesive family unit, as well as a sense of pride and accomplishment in the family's achievements.

"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you today to express my strong belief that students at your school should be allowed to participate in sports and activities, even if their grades are currently below a D. While academic performance is important, it is not the only factor that should be considered when determining whether a student should be allowed to participate in extracurricular activities.

First and foremost, participation in sports and activities can have a positive impact on a student's mental and physical health. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and increase self-esteem. Additionally, participating in sports and activities can help students develop important social skills, such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. These skills are not only valuable in sports and activities, but they can also be applied to academic and professional settings.

Furthermore, participation in sports and activities can provide students with a sense of belonging and purpose. Many students may feel overwhelmed or disconnected from their peers, and participation in sports and activities can provide a sense of community and support. Additionally, many students may not have the opportunity to participate in sports or activities due to financial or logistical constraints, and allowing them to participate can provide them with an equal opportunity to engage in these activities.

Finally, it is important to remember that academic performance is not the only factor that should be considered when determining whether a student should be allowed to participate in sports and activities. While academic performance is important, it is not the only thing that defines a student's worth or potential. Many students may have unique talents or interests that are not reflected in their grades, and allowing them to participate in sports and activities can provide them with an opportunity to explore and develop these interests.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that students at your school should be allowed to participate in sports and activities, even if their grades are currently below a D. Participation in sports and activities can have a positive impact on a student's mental and physical health, provide students with a sense of belonging and purpose, and allow students to explore and develop their unique talents and interests. I urge you to consider this perspective when making decisions about student participation in extracurricular activities.

Sincerely,

"Hey, ya'll! 😃 So, I know we're in 8th grade and we're supposed to be learning stuff, but let's be real, cell phones are like, super important too! 📱 Like, have you seen how much stuff you can find on the internet?! It's crazy! 🤯

Okay, okay, I know some people might be like, ""Ugh, cell phones in the classroom?! No way!"" But hear me out! 💭 Using cell phones in class can be super helpful for learning, but it can also be distracting if we're not careful. 😳

First of all, let's talk about the advantages. If we can use our phones in class, we can look up stuff and learn more about what we're studying! 🤓 Like, if we're learning about history, we can look up pictures and videos of important events and people. It makes it way more interesting than just reading out of a book! 📚 And if we're learning a new language, we can use apps to practice speaking and listening! 🗣️ It's like having our own little language lab in our pockets! 💡

But, there are also some disadvantages. If we're not careful, we might get distracted by all the fun stuff on our phones! 😅 Like, I know I'm guilty of scrolling through Instagram during class sometimes. 🙈 And if we're not paying attention, we might miss important stuff! 🙀 So, it's important to use our phones responsibly and only when it's necessary. 🤝

So, what do you guys think? Should we be allowed to use our phones in class? 🤔 Let me know in the comments! 💬 And don't forget to follow me on Instagram! 😉 #CellPhonesInClass #LearningInTheDigitalAge #8thGradeProblems 📚📱",1,llama2_chat,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that students should have the option to attend school from home. While attending school in person has its benefits, there are also many advantages to being home schooled. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of students being able to attend school from home, including how it affects attendance, responsibility, and job preparation.

One of the main benefits of attending school from home is that it allows students to have more flexibility in their schedules. This is particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities. For example, if a student is a talented athlete, they may be able to attend school from home and still have ample time to practice and compete in their sport. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have family obligations, such as caring for younger siblings.

Another benefit of attending school from home is that it can foster a greater sense of responsibility in students. When students are responsible for their own education, they must take a more active role in their learning. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and problem-solving. Additionally, when students are home schooled, they often have more one-on-one time with their teachers, which can help them develop a stronger relationship with their educator and receive more personalized attention.

However, there are also some drawbacks to attending school from home. One of the main concerns is that students may not have the same level of social interaction as they would in a traditional classroom setting. This can be particularly problematic for students who are new to a school or community, as they may struggle to make friends and form meaningful relationships with their peers. Additionally, some students may miss the structure and routine of a traditional school setting, which can make it difficult for them to stay on track with their studies.

Another potential drawback of attending school from home is that it may not provide the same level of job preparation as a traditional school setting. While home schooling can be tailored to a student's individual needs and interests, it may not provide the same level of exposure to a diverse range of subjects and extracurricular activities that a traditional school setting offers. This can make it more difficult for students to be competitive in the job market and may limit their career opportunities.

"Learning from other people's experiences can be an invaluable resource. Whether it's hearing stories about someone's successes or struggling with their own journey, taking time to listen to and learn from someone else's experiences is often the best way to make sure we don't make the same mistakes. Knowing someone else's challenges and their solutions ahead of time can help us steer clear of potential pitfalls. 

On a larger scale, learning from other's experiences can help us understand the nature of reality better and put us in a better position to make more informed decisions. By gaining insights from those who have gone before us, we can become more prepared for our own experiences. We can study their approaches, their successes and their failures, and use that knowledge to our advantage. 

Moreover, learning from other people's experiences allows us to develop connections with others by building relationships and sharing ideas. When we help others out, we create bonds that can last a lifetime. We learn from the past, but more importantly, we build for the future. 

In short, learning from other people's experiences is an indispensable tool for achieving a better life. Hearing stories about others’ successes and failures can make us more informed and get us better prepared for our own journey through life. We can pick the brains of people who have gone before us, build relationships, and grow together. In this way, learning from other people's experiences can be a powerful tool for personal and collective growth.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Recent events in our society have highlighted the importance of trusting our own judgment rather than relying solely on the advice of so-called ""experts"". Being able to think independently and look at the unique aspects of a situation is increasingly becoming the best way to make decisions. This is never more evident than in the realm of self-actualization, where the individual is unique and is often best-suited to make decisions on their own behalf. 

For example, the career path chosen by an individual should primarily be based on the personal goals and values of the individual. Relying on generic career advice from an ""expert"" can lead to outcomes that do not best reflect the individual's interests and potential. Similarly, when making decisions about which products or services to purchase, taking into account personal preference and value-based judgments can often lead to better decisions than relying on expert advice. 

On the other hand, however, it is important to recognize that being independent does not always equate with being correct. Making autonomous decisions should always involve considering the potential negative outcomes. Failing to do so can lead to disastrous results, sometimes even worse than blindly following expert advice. Therefore, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of any decision made before going ahead. Ultimately, learning to trust our own judgement is a valuable life skill, but it should never be done without the appropriate caution.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

"Hey there!  For this essay, I had to research the benefits of having a positive attitude in achieving success. It's pretty cool to think about how much of a difference it can make.

So, first off, having a positive attitude can help you achieve success in so many ways. For one, it can give you the motivation and drive to work hard and push through challenges. When you believe in yourself and your abilities, you're more likely to take risks and try new things, which can lead to great things. Plus, having a positive attitude can make you more likable and relatable to others, which can open up more opportunities for you.

But, of course, there are also obstacles that can get in the way of achieving success. Like, sometimes things just don't go your way, no matter how hard you try. Or, you might be surrounded by negative influences that can bring you down. It's important to have techniques to remain positive in those situations, like focusing on the good things in your life or finding ways to distract yourself from the negative stuff.

Another thing I learned is that success isn't just about having a positive attitude. It's also about putting in the effort and hard work. Like, even if you have a positive attitude, if you're not putting in the effort, you're not gonna achieve your goals. But, having a positive attitude can help you stay motivated and focused, which can make the hard work feel less daunting.

I also think that a positive attitude can help you discover your passions and achieve personal objectives. When you're positive and open-minded, you're more likely to try new things and take risks, which can lead to discovering things you never knew you were passionate about. And, when you're passionate about something, you're more likely to put in the effort to achieve your goals.

Lastly, I think it's important to remember that success isn't just about personal achievements. It's also about how you can help others and make a positive impact on the world. When you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to be kind and compassionate towards others, which can lead to making a difference in their lives.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Working in a group can offer many benefits that working alone does not. For starters, working in a group allows individuals to gain a variety of perspectives on any given task. By hearing other people’s ideas and opinions, individuals can gain a better understanding of any situation, and figure out the best solutions. Working as a team can also help everyone to stay focused and motivated, leading to more efficient and productive work. 

Examples of successful people who work in teams include successful entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos, as well as creative professionals like directors Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams. As these examples indicate, a team can come up with innovative solutions and ideas, and be more creative than working alone. 

In contrast, working alone may have its own advantages. For example, working alone ensures full control over any project without having to compromise with other team members. However, the problem of working alone is that it can be time-consuming and tedious, as getting stuck on any problem will put a halt to progress.

Overall, it is clear that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone as teams can come up with more innovative and creative solutions, and be more productive. Working together also allows individuals to expand their knowledge and receive feedback on their work, which can be an invaluable asset.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Technology has had a significant impact on people's lives, and it has brought numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole. In this essay, I will discuss the positive effects of technology on people's lives, provide examples of how technology makes people's daily tasks easier, discuss how technology can help those in difficult situations, examine how technology allows students to complete daily tasks without direct contact with other people, and explore how technology can help students in their schooling.

One of the most significant positive effects of technology on people's lives is the way it makes daily tasks easier. For example, technology has made it possible for people to shop online, which saves time and money. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to communicate with others easily, regardless of where they are in the world. This has made it easier for people to maintain relationships with friends and family members who live far away.

Another way that technology has had a positive impact on people's lives is by helping those in difficult situations. For example, technology has made it possible for people to access medical care remotely, which can be especially helpful for those who live in rural areas or have limited mobility. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to receive mental health support through online therapy and other digital resources.

Technology has also had a significant impact on education. For example, technology has made it possible for students to access educational resources and complete assignments online. This can be especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in areas with limited educational resources. Additionally, technology has made it possible for students to collaborate on projects with others, regardless of where they are in the world.

Finally, technology has allowed people to complete daily tasks without direct contact with other people. For example, people can use technology to shop online, pay bills, and complete other tasks without ever leaving their homes. This can be especially helpful for people who are immunocompromised or who have other health concerns that make it difficult for them to interact with others in person.

In conclusion, technology has had numerous positive effects on people's lives, from making daily tasks easier to helping those in difficult situations. Technology has also had a significant impact on education, allowing students to access educational resources and collaborate with others from anywhere in the world. Finally, technology has allowed people to complete daily tasks without direct contact with others, which can be especially helpful",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"The importance of being successful in life versus being a failure depends on how an individual defines success. Success lies in achieving and maintaining it, while failure involves giving up or not being able to meet the standards of success.

To prevent failing in life, one must set realistic goals and make sure to create a plan to achieve it. Even after failing, one can capitalize on past mistakes and become successful again by learning from them. However, staying successful all the time comes with its own set of challenges. It can be difficult to remain humble and maintain that same level of success. Additionally, one should be aware that complacency can lead to a downward spiral of failure. Therefore, to remain successful, it is important to remain aware of one's surroundings and adjust according to new challenges.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4

It's like, they're both trying to tell you what to do, but in different ways. And, you know, it's important to listen to both of them because they're both important.

But, sometimes, people can be really negative and try to bring you down. They might be like, ""Oh, you're never gonna make it."" Or, ""That's not gonna work."" And, it's easy to get caught up in that and start feeling like you can't do things. But, you gotta ignore that stuff. Like, you gotta have faith in yourself and your ideas, even if other people don't.

So, how do you stay motivated and ignore the negativity? Well, I think it's important to set goals for yourself and work towards them. Like, if you want to start a business, you gotta start taking steps towards making it happen. And, you gotta be willing to learn and take risks. It's not gonna be easy, but it'll be worth it in the end.

And, it's also important to surround yourself with people who support you and believe in you. Like, if you're trying to start a band, you want people who are gonna be like, ""Yeah, you can do it!"" And, not try to bring you down.

So, in conclusion, listening to your heart and mind when making decisions and staying motivated to achieve success can be really hard, but it's important to do it. You gotta ignore the negativity and keep going. And, it's okay to ask for help and support along the way. Thanks for reading!",1,llama2_chat,4
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Working during school can be a great opportunity for students, but it can also have some downsides. On one hand, having a job during school can teach students important skills like time management and responsibility. For example, if I have a part-time job after school, I have to make sure I finish my homework and studying before I go to work. This helps me learn how to prioritize my tasks and manage my time effectively. Additionally, working during school can give students a sense of independence and financial freedom. If I save up enough money from my job, I can buy things I want or save it for college.

On the other hand, working during school can also negatively impact a student's academic performance. For instance, if I have to work too many hours, I might not have enough time to study for exams or complete my assignments. This can lead to lower grades and a decrease in my overall academic performance. Furthermore, working during school can also take away from the time I spend with my friends and family. I might not be able to hang out with them as much, which can be lonely and isolating.

Another con of working during school is that it can be hard to balance work and school responsibilities. For example, if I have a big project due for school, but I also have to work that day, I might not be able to finish both tasks. This can lead to stress and anxiety, which is not good for my mental health.

In conclusion, working during school can have both positive and negative effects on students. While it can teach important skills and give students financial freedom, it can also negatively impact their academic performance and social life. As an 8th grader, I think it's important to strike a balance between work and school responsibilities. Maybe I can work a few hours a week after school, but make sure I have enough time to study and hang out with my friends and family. This way, I can enjoy the benefits of working while also doing well in school.",1,llama2_chat,1
"Hey there! 

So, I've been tasked with writing an essay about my best friend, Generic_Name, and how they've been a rockstar in my life.  I've gotta say, it's pretty cool to think about all the ways they've been there for me.

First off, let's talk about homeschooling. I've heard some people say that it's better than traditional schools because you get more one-on-one time with your teachers. But, I mean, I've never actually been to a traditional school, so I can't really compare.  What I do know is that homeschooling can be super flexible, and I've been able to learn at my own pace. Plus, I get to spend more time with my family and Generic_Name, which is like, the best thing ever.

Now, onto the significance of best friends.  They're like, the best thing since sliced bread, you know?  Having someone who's always got your back is like, the best feeling in the world. And, Generic_Name has been that person for me.  We've been through so much together, from struggling with math homework to trying to find the perfect outfit for the school dance. 

Okay, so, Generic_Name has been a best friend to me in every way.  They're always there to listen, to offer advice, and to share wisdom.  Like, when I was feeling really down about my grades, they were like, ""Hey, you got this! Just study harder and you'll be fine."" And, when I was stressing out about the school play, they were like, ""Don't worry, you're gonna kill it! Just relax and have fun.""  They're always so supportive and encouraging, and I don't know what I would do without them.

But, what really stands out to me about Generic_Name is their character traits.  They're always willing to help others, whether it'",1,llama2_chat,1
"High school is a difficult time for many students, as they are faced with the pressures and stresses of adolescence and academic achievement. Art classes can be a great way for students to relieve stress and improve their ability to absorb new information. Making art classes mandatory for high school students provides many benefits, such as giving students access to creative outlets, developing grit and mental focus, and improving communication skills. However, it can be difficult to maintain focus in art classes, especially when compared to more conventional academic classes. Moreover, some students may be resistant to the required coursework and feel that it takes away from their academic pursuits. 

Nevertheless, students who are not particularly interested in art classes can still benefit from them. Art classes can often provide a refreshing break from the regular academic curriculum and teaching students creative problem solving can help to improve their critical thinking skills. Additionally, focusing on something other than academic subjects for a period of time can be a great way for students to re-energize themselves and gain a new perspective on their studies.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Sure, here's my essay:

Hey there!  So, I've been thinking a lot about my talents and skills lately, and I've realized that I'm most passionate about writing. I know, I know, it's not exactly the most exciting thing in the world, but I just can't help it. There's something about putting my thoughts and ideas into words that just feels right to me. Plus, I'm pretty good at it too! 

So, in my free time, I like to write short stories, poetry, and even the occasional journal entry. I find it really helps me to express myself and process my emotions. And the more I write, the better I get! It's like this whole cycle of creativity and improvement that I'm totally hooked on. 

Of course, I know I'm not perfect at writing yet, so I'm always trying to learn and improve. I read books on writing, watch videos, and even take online courses to help me hone my skills. It's a lot of fun, even if it can be a bit frustrating at times. But hey, that's just part of the process, right? 

Another thing I'm really into right now is playing the guitar. I know, I know, it's not exactly the most practical skill in the world, but I just love the way it sounds!  There's something so soothing and satisfying about creating music with just a few chords and some picking. Plus, it's a great way to express myself and relieve stress. 

So, to master my guitar skills, I try to practice for at least a few minutes every day. It might not seem like a lot, but trust me, it adds up! And the more I play, the better I get. It's like this whole cycle of improvement that I'm totally hooked on. 

Overall, I'm really passionate about writing and playing the guitar, and I'm always trying to find new ways to improve and grow. It's like this whole journey of self-discovery",1,llama2_chat,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that music, drama, and art classes should be made compulsory for all students. While some may argue that these classes are not necessary for academic success, I believe that they are essential for personal and social development. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of making these classes compulsory and explain my opinion on the matter.

On the one hand, making music, drama, and art classes compulsory can have numerous benefits for students. These classes provide students with an opportunity to express themselves creatively and develop their artistic skills. Through these classes, students can learn how to work collaboratively with others and develop their communication skills. Additionally, these classes can help students to develop their self-confidence and self-esteem.

On the other hand, some may argue that these classes take away valuable time from academic subjects and that students should be able to choose what they want to study. While it is true that these classes may not directly contribute to academic success, they can still have a positive impact on a student's overall education. For example, studies have shown that exposure to the arts can improve cognitive function and academic performance.

In my opinion, making music, drama, and art classes compulsory for all students is a positive step towards promoting personal and social development. While these classes may not directly contribute to academic success, they can still have a positive impact on a student's overall education. By providing students with an opportunity to express themselves creatively and develop their artistic skills, these classes can help students to develop their self-confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, by teaching students how to work collaboratively with others and develop their communication skills, these classes can help students to succeed in all areas of their lives.

In conclusion, I believe that making music, drama, and art classes compulsory for all students is a positive step towards promoting personal and social development. While these classes may not directly contribute to academic success, they can still have a positive impact on a student's overall education. By providing students with an opportunity to express themselves creatively and develop their artistic skills, these classes can help students to develop their self-confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, by teaching students how to work collaboratively with others and develop their communication skills, these classes can help students to succeed in all areas of their lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always been fascinated by the successes of soccer players who have tried different things to grow as individuals. One such player is Gerard Pique, a Spanish defender who has achieved great success in his career. Pique's success can be attributed to his willingness to try new things and adapt to different situations.

Pique began his career as a striker, but as he grew older, he realized that his height and physicality made him more suited to the defensive position. This realization led him to work hard on his defensive skills and eventually become one of the best defenders in the world. By trying different things and adapting to his strengths, Pique was able to achieve great success in his career.

On the other hand, there are soccer players who specialize in what they have mastered and have achieved great success as a result. Lionel Messi, an Argentine midfielder, is one such player. Messi has always been a master of dribbling and passing, and he has spent his entire career honing these skills. As a result, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest soccer players of all time.

While both Pique and Messi have achieved great success, their approaches to their careers are very different. Pique was willing to try new things and adapt to different situations, while Messi has always focused on honing his existing skills. This raises the question of whether people have to try different things to grow as individuals.

I believe that people do have to try different things to grow as individuals. Trying new things exposes us to new experiences and challenges, which can help us develop new skills and perspectives. By stepping outside of our comfort zones, we can learn to adapt to different situations and become more resilient.

Furthermore, trying different things can help us discover our true passions and talents. Pique's decision to switch positions ultimately led him to find his true calling as a defender. Similarly, Messi's focus on honing his dribbling and passing skills led him to become one of the greatest soccer players of all time.

In conclusion, the successes of soccer players like Pique and Messi demonstrate the importance of trying different things to grow as individuals. While specializing in what we have mastered can lead to great success, it",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Thomas Jefferson believed that productivity was essential for personal growth and development. He wrote in a letter to William C. Jarvis, ""Determine never to be idle…It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson recognized the potential power of consistent effort and encouraged others to stay busy in order to achieve worthwhile goals. 

At the same time, Jefferson believed that inactivity could have an important role to play in how we use our time. In his view, moments of pause could lead to reflection, contemplation, and self-examination–all of which are critical mental exercises that can lead to increased productivity, once motivation has been restored. 

When seeking to maximize our productivity, it is important to differentiate between Idle activities and productive activities. Idle activities, such as watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing video games, can​ be enjoyable, but can also reduce our motivation and prevent us from reaching our goals. Productive activities, such as research, problem-solving, reading, and project-building, can help us to pursue our ambitions and are important for personal growth. 

To accomplish more, we must set achievable goals and use our time wisely. To achieve our goals, we must utilize strategies such as breaking them up into manageable parts, setting a timeline for completion, and utilizing motivational techniques. Making a conscious effort to focus our efforts on productive activities rather than idle ones may also help us to be more successful in reaching our goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"When it comes to student academic achievement, engagement levels, and potential for early graduation, online classes and traditional classroom-based education differ in key ways. In terms of student academic achievement, studies have shown that students enrolled in online classes generally score higher on tests than their counterparts in traditional classrooms, in part due to an increased ability to focus on the topic material. Similarly, students in online classes tend to have higher engagement levels than their counterparts in traditional classrooms, as there are no distractions from their peers. Finally, online classes can also potentially lead to early graduation, as students are able to work more quickly and are presented with a wider range of course options.

Pros of online classes include increased student focus, higher engagement levels, and potential for early graduation. On the other hand, cons of online classes include the lack of forum-style discussions or lectures, technology issues, and a greater emphasis on independent study.

Pros of traditional classroom-based education include the opportunity for more interactive learning, a sense of community among students, and exposure to potential mentors. Cons of traditional classroom-based education include the potential for classroom distractions, set curriculum, and limited course options.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Learning in a classroom setting and in a home setting both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. In a classroom setting, students have the opportunity to directly interact with teachers and other students, which can foster collaboration and discussion and help deepen one's understanding of the material. On the other hand, there can often be distractions in the classroom, such as other students talking or texts and emails buzzing, that can disrupt one's focus. 

In contrast, learning in a home setting can be incredibly effective, as there is usually fewer distractions and a more relaxed environment. As well, if a student finds they are struggling with a topic, they can usually take more time to go back over it without feeling rushed or put on the spot. However, without direct feedback from a teacher or other students, some learners may feel too isolated or lack the motivation to stay on track. 

No matter what setting it takes place in, effective learning happens when one takes responsibility for their own learning and is willing and motivated to make the most of any environment.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about how knowing multiple skills is way better than just knowing one. Like, think about it. If you're only good at one thing, you're pretty much stuck with that one thing forever. But if you know multiple things, you have so many more options!

For example, let's say you're really good at playing the guitar. That's cool and all, but what if you want to switch to playing the piano? Or maybe you want to try singing? If you know how to play the guitar, you can totally learn how to play the piano or sing! But if you only know how to play the guitar, you're stuck with that one instrument forever.

It's the same with sports. If you're only good at one sport, you might get bored with it after a while and want to try something else. But if you know how to play multiple sports, you can switch between them whenever you want! Plus, it's way more fun to play different sports and learn new things.

And it's not just sports and music. Knowing multiple skills can help you in school too! If you're good at math and science, but you also know how to write good essays and stuff, you're way more likely to get good grades. Plus, you'll have more options when you're applying for colleges and stuff.

So, in conclusion, knowing multiple skills is way better than just knowing one. It gives you more options and makes life way more fun. So, try to learn as many things as you can, okay? Thanks for reading!",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey, so like, I'm totally gonna write this essay on why it's important to be true to yourself and not let what other people say affect you. I mean, it's like, totally basic, but it's also really important.

First of all, let's talk about why it's important to be true to yourself. Like, if you're not being real and authentic, you're basically living a lie. And who wants to do that? Not me, that's for sure. When you're true to yourself, you're able to be happy and confident, and you don't have to worry about what other people think of you. It's like, you're not living for anyone else's approval, you're living for yourself. And that's like, the best feeling ever.

But like, it's not just about you, you know? When you're true to yourself, you're also setting an example for others. Like, if you're confident and happy with who you are, other people are gonna be like, ""Wow, I want to be like that!"" And then they'll start being true to themselves too. It's like, a domino effect, you know?

And it's not just about being happy and confident, either. When you're true to yourself, you're also more creative and innovative. Like, you're not afraid to try new things and take risks, because you know that you're being true to yourself. And that's when the really cool stuff happens, like, when you come up with new ideas and make new discoveries.

But you can't let them get to you, you know? You just gotta keep being true to yourself and not let their negativity affect you.

"Using imagination and creativity is incredibly useful and important in many jobs and fields. Writers, artists, fashion designers, singers, and photographers are just a few examples of roles in which one must use their creative skills and imaginations. Common skills associated with these creative roles are artistic vision, storytelling abilities, musical flair, understanding of color, and the ability to craft unique ideas. For instance, fashion designer Diane Von Fürstenberg used her imagination and creative vision to dress and redefine women's wardrobes with her signature wrap-dress. Musician Kendrick Lamar utilized his rap skills to tell creative stories and deliver unique messages.

Creative thinking and the ability to imagine is not only important in the workplace but also in everyday life. One way to use imagination and creativity in everyday life is to approach a problem from a new perspective. For example, if something isn't working, think of creative solutions that could help overcome any challenges. Imagination and creativity can also be used to explore new hobbies or interests, such as painting a picture or creating a DIY project. Everyone has the potential to use their imagination and creativity - the only limit is your own mind.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many students opting to learn remotely instead of attending classes in person. While there are certainly advantages to distance learning, such as flexibility and convenience, there are also several disadvantages that cannot be ignored. In this essay, I will outline the disadvantages of distance learning compared to attending classes in person, research examples of how communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers can benefit students who are attending classes in person, describe how these aspects are valuable, and ultimately argue that attending classes in person is a better option than distance learning.

One of the main disadvantages of distance learning is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. In person classes allow for more opportunities for communication and collaboration, which can be essential for learning. Teachers can provide immediate feedback and answer questions in real-time, while classmates can share ideas and resources. This type of interaction is not possible with distance learning, which often relies on asynchronous communication and can make it difficult for students to get the help they need.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is the lack of competition. In person classes often involve group projects and assignments, which can help students learn to work collaboratively and develop their critical thinking skills. Additionally, attending classes in person can provide a sense of motivation and accountability, as students are surrounded by their peers and teachers who are also working towards similar goals. This type of environment can be difficult to replicate in a distance learning setting, where students may be more likely to procrastinate or give up.

Finally, attending classes in person can provide inspiration from teachers. Teachers are often passionate and knowledgeable about their subject matter, and can provide students with valuable insights and perspectives that may not be available through other means. Additionally, attending classes in person can provide students with role models and mentors who can help guide them on their academic and personal journeys. This type of inspiration is not possible with distance learning, which often relies on pre-recorded lectures and online resources.

In conclusion, while there are certainly advantages to distance learning, there are also several disadvantages that cannot be ignored. The lack of face-to-face interaction, competition, and inspiration from teachers are all valuable aspects of attending classes in person that online learning cannot offer. Ultimately, attending classes in person is a better option for students",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"After researching the advantages and disadvantages of extending the school day to two hours for a four-day week, it is the recommendation of this report that the school should extend the school day. The extended school day would provide more time for teachers to complete their syllabi and would reduce the amount of student stress due to shortened test-intensive days. Additionally, students who are working would not have to miss classes and would benefit from better time management skills that would come from the four-day school week. However, the extended school day should come with specific guidelines such as an optional lunch period and alternate modes of instruction to ensure that student engagement and educational goals are not sacrificed.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey there! 

I totally disagree with the idea of school districts providing a three year high school program instead of the traditional four year one. Like, I know some people might think it's cool to finish high school early, but trust me, there are so many reasons why it's better to stick with the four year program.

First of all, most colleges prefer students who have completed four years of high school. It's like, they want us to be well-rounded and prepared for college, you know? By finishing high school in three years, we're missing out on a whole year of learning and growth. And let's be real, college is super important, so we should do everything we can to make sure we're ready for it.

Another thing is, it's way harder to achieve the required credits in a three year program. Like, I get it, some people might be really smart and can learn everything fast, but most of us need that extra time to really understand the material and get good grades. And if we're in a rush to finish high school early, we might end up not getting the grades we need to get into college. Not cool.

And let's not forget about the importance of having access to teachers, counselors, and librarians. They're like, super important for our success, you know? They help us with our homework, give us advice, and teach us new things. By cutting out a year of high school, we're missing out on all that support and guidance. Not good.

Lastly, it's important to send a good message to younger kids. Like, if we finish high school early, they might think it's okay to skip out on school too. And that's not cool, you know? We should be setting a good example for them, showing them that hard work and dedication pay off in the long run.

So yeah, in conclusion, school districts should definitely not provide a three year high school program instead of the four year one. It's just not worth it, you know? Let's stick with the traditional program and make sure we're fully prepared for college and life in general.",1,llama2_chat,3
"The journey to success is often fraught with failure; however, the resilience to overcome and learn from set-backs will be the mark of greatness. Winston Churchill's quote of “success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm” illustrates this idea perfectly. One great example of a success story is the development of the light bulb. Despite numerous prototypes and constant failures, the light bulb was finally brought to fruition by the determination and enthusiasm of its inventors. This example highlights the importance of enthusiasm when pursuing goals and demonstrates how failure can be a valuable asset. On the other hand, the tendency to listen to negative feedback from others can have a detrimental effect on an individual’s confidence. The success stories of those who refuse to be deterred by set-backs serve as a reminder of the importance of focusing on personal motivation rather than the opinions of others.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that a program that pairs older students with younger ones for academic and recreational activities would be a great way to improve the academic performance of younger students. This program would not only provide academic support, but also foster a sense of community and mentorship among students of all ages.

One of the main benefits of this program is that older students can help younger students review their notes for important tests, such as the SOLs. This is a crucial aspect of academic success, as these tests can determine a student's grade and future opportunities. By having an older student to review their notes with, younger students can gain a better understanding of the material and feel more confident going into the test.

In addition to academic support, this program can also provide recreational activities for younger students to participate in. Board games, reading, and sports are all great ways to engage students and help them relax and have fun. These activities can also be a great way to build relationships and foster a sense of community among students.

Overall, I believe that this program would be a great way to improve the academic performance of younger students and foster a sense of community and mentorship among students of all ages. By providing academic support and recreational activities, this program can help younger students become better prepared to take their academic studies into higher levels of education.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

"Being true to oneself is an important aspect of life, but it can also be challenging in a world that tries to make you someone else. On the one hand, being true to oneself can bring a sense of fulfillment and happiness. On the other hand, it can also lead to social isolation and a lack of acceptance from others.

One advantage of being true to oneself is that it allows you to live a life that is authentic and meaningful. When you are true to yourself, you are able to express your thoughts and feelings in a way that is genuine and sincere. This can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and understanding, which can ultimately lead to greater happiness and fulfillment.

Another advantage of being true to oneself is that it can lead to greater self-confidence. When you are true to yourself, you are able to trust your own instincts and make decisions based on what is best for you. This can lead to a greater sense of self-assuredness and a more confident approach to life.

However, there are also some disadvantages to being true to oneself. One disadvantage is that it can lead to social isolation. When you are true to yourself, you may not always fit in with the expectations and norms of others. This can make it difficult to form meaningful relationships and to connect with others on a deeper level.

Another disadvantage of being true to oneself is that it can lead to a lack of acceptance from others. When you are true to yourself, you may not always conform to the expectations and norms of others. This can lead to a lack of acceptance and understanding from others, which can be difficult and hurtful.

In conclusion, being true to oneself can bring a sense of fulfillment and happiness, but it can also lead to social isolation and a lack of acceptance from others. Ultimately, the decision to be true to oneself is a personal one, and it is up to each individual to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is right for them.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"The power of the imagination is often highly valued and revered, but having knowledge can be far more beneficial and rewarding. Many may think that a person with a big imagination may be seen as ungrounded or frivolous, and that can lead to being taken less seriously in certain areas, particularly in the realm of academics. This can lead to feeling afraid, and for some, a lack of confidence in their abilities.

Having knowledge, however, carries different connotations. With knowledge, a person can speak more confidently in conversations and be able to demonstrate their understanding or expertise in a subject. It also can give a sense of security, knowing that having understanding can make situations more manageable and free someone from fear and anxiety.

In short, knowledge is often seen with more respect, while an overactive imagination may cause a person to be seen as flighty or lacking seriousness. For these reasons, it is better to have knowledge than an imagination. With knowledge, one can go far, navigating through conversations and gaining a better understanding of different topics with ease.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Graduating high school in three years can provide many opportunities for young students that wouldn't be available in a traditional four year high school program. Graduating at an early age gives students the unique opportunity to explore higher education and the workforce, while also providing valuable time to build real-world experience. 

One great example of a successful person who achieved early graduation is Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook. At just the age of 19, Zuckerberg graduated from Harvard University after attending high school for only three years. Although Zuckerberg made a habit of jumping ahead of his peers, he states that he only considered graduating early after he took Advanced Placement courses during his high school years. 

High school graduates also have the option of pursuing special opportunities that open up to them earlier if they don't take the traditional four year route. For instance, many universities offer early admission and scholarships programs to students who choose to apply early. Furthermore, some high schools may even offer special degree programs that allow students to graduate early while earning college credit or a technical certificate. 

Finally, one of the most notable advantages for young students who choose to graduate high school in three years is the benefit of taking a gap year. A gap year offers students the chance to take time away from their studies to spend a year in specialized activities, such as volunteering, travel, research, and education. During this gap year, students have the unique opportunity to gain valuable skills, network, and explore new interests, all of which can provide advantages later in life.

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years can provide a variety of benefits and opportunities for young students that may not be available in the traditional four year route. Students that choose to pursue this route can look forward to taking advantage of special programs and resources, furthering their education early, and taking a gap year to explore new interests.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey there!  So, I've been thinking a lot about that policy change that's been going around, you know? The one that says you gotta have at least a B average to join the sports teams. I mean, I get why they're doing it, but I also think it's kinda unfair. 

First of all, let's talk about the pros. I mean, it makes sense that you gotta have good grades to play sports. It's like, you gotta be focused on school too, you know? And if you're not doing well in class, how are you gonna do well on the field? Makes sense, right?  Plus, it'll probably make people try harder in school, 'cause they don't wanna miss out on the fun. 

But, there are also some cons.  Like, what if someone's not doing so great in school, but they're super into sports? They might feel really left out if they can't join the team 'cause of their grades. And it's not like sports are the only thing that matters in life, you know?  Maybe they're good at something else too, like music or art. 

And then there's the thing about college acceptance.  I mean, I know it's important, but it's not like it's the only thing that matters either.  Like, I wanna go to college for sure, but I also wanna have fun and do stuff that makes me happy.  Maybe I'll be a professional gamer or something. 

So, overall, I think it's a pretty tough call.  I mean, I get why they're doing it, but I also think it's unfair to some people.  Maybe they could just have like, a B- average or something?  That way, people can still join the teams, but they gotta try a little harder in school too.

"Online school vs. Regular School: Which is Better?

As an 8th grader, I have had the opportunity to experience both online school and regular school attendance. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and in this essay, I will analyze the differences between the two.

One of the biggest advantages of online school is the flexibility it offers. With online school, I can learn at my own pace and on my own schedule. This is especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where access to regular schools may be limited. For example, I have a part-time job after school, and with online school, I can complete my coursework whenever and wherever I want. This flexibility also allows me to take breaks when I need to, which helps me stay focused and avoid burnout.

On the other hand, regular school attendance has its own advantages. For one, I get to see my friends and teachers in person every day. This social interaction is important for my mental health and well-being, and it helps me stay motivated and engaged in my studies. Additionally, regular school provides a structured environment that helps me stay on track and avoid distractions. For example, my teachers provide me with a set schedule and deadlines, which helps me stay organized and focused.

Another advantage of regular school is the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities. I enjoy playing on the school soccer team, and regular school allows me to do so. Online school, on the other hand, does not offer the same opportunities for extracurricular involvement. While this may not be a deal-breaker for some students, it is something to consider when deciding between the two.

However, there are also some disadvantages to online school. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of face-to-face interaction with my teachers and peers. While I can communicate with my teachers and classmates through email or video calls, it's not the same as being in the same room together. This can make it harder to build relationships and collaborate on projects.

Another disadvantage of online school is the potential for distractions. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, it can be easy to get sidetracked and fall behind on my coursework. Additionally",1,llama2_chat,2
"As an 8th-grade student, I have been considering the option of graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years in high school. While this may seem like a quicker route to graduation, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each option. In this essay, I will research and analyze the benefits and drawbacks of graduating in three years compared to four years in high school, and provide an argument as to which option I believe is better.

One of the main advantages of graduating in three years is the cost savings. By completing high school in three years, students can save a year of tuition and fees. This can be a significant financial burden for many families, and can make it easier for students to attend college or pursue other post-secondary education opportunities. Additionally, students who graduate in three years may be able to enter the workforce sooner, which can lead to higher earning potential over time.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to graduating in three years. One of the main concerns is that students may not be fully prepared for college or the workforce. High school graduation requirements vary by state, but many students are required to take a certain number of core classes in order to graduate. By completing these requirements in three years, students may not have had the opportunity to take as many elective courses or participate in extracurricular activities. This can make it more difficult for them to stand out to colleges or employers and may limit their career opportunities.

Another potential disadvantage of graduating in three years is that students may not have had the same level of socialization as their peers who graduated in four years. High school is an important time for social development, and students who graduate in three years may miss out on opportunities to build relationships with their peers and participate in school events.

In my opinion, graduating in three years is not the best option. While it may save money and allow students to enter the workforce sooner, the potential disadvantages outweigh the benefits. Students who graduate in three years may not be fully prepared for college or the workforce, and may miss out on important socialization opportunities. Additionally, the cost savings may not be enough to offset the potential drawbacks of graduating in three years.

Having a positive attitude is a crucial aspect of our lives, both in the workplace and in daily life. It is a mindset that allows us to approach challenges with optimism, resilience, and determination. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of having a positive attitude, the role of respect in maintaining a positive attitude, and how it affects our lives compared to a negative attitude.

First, let's examine the benefits of having a positive attitude in the workplace. Research has shown that employees with a positive attitude are more productive, creative, and engaged in their work. They are also more likely to have better relationships with their colleagues and superiors, leading to a more collaborative and supportive work environment. Moreover, a positive attitude can help employees cope with stress and adversity, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life both inside and outside of work.

In daily life, having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on our overall well-being. It can help us navigate through difficult situations with grace and resilience, leading to a more positive outlook on life. It also helps us attract positive energy and opportunities into our lives, leading to a more fulfilling and happy existence. Furthermore, a positive attitude can help us overcome negative self-talk and self-doubt, leading to a more confident and self-assured personality.

The role of respect is also crucial in maintaining a positive attitude. Respect is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and it is no different in the workplace or in daily life. When we respect others, we create a sense of mutual trust and understanding, leading to a more harmonious and productive environment. Respect also helps us develop empathy and compassion towards others, leading to a more compassionate and understanding society.

Comparing and contrasting how a positive attitude affects our lives compared to a negative attitude, we can see the stark difference it makes. A negative attitude can lead to feelings of hopelessness, despair, and lack of motivation, leading to a more unfulfilling and unhappy existence. On the other hand, a positive attitude can lead to feelings of optimism, resilience, and determination, leading to a more fulfilling and happy existence.

"It is undeniable that our character is an intrinsic part of who we are. It is our individual character that prevents us from succumbing to the more base or undesirable aspects of society, and instead enables us to act in a manner that is beneficial to ourselves and those around us. When considering how our character is shaped, it is impossible to deny that our choices have a fundamental role. It is in fact the choices we make which form the bedrock of our character.

When we make good decisions, it is likely that our character will become more virtuous; conversely, if we constantly make the wrong decisions, it is likely that our character will be in decline. It is these choices which will ultimately define our character; and will shape who we become in the future. Furthermore, if we make decisions that benefit ourselves and those around us, it is likely that our character is of a higher caliber than if we were to disregard the consequences of our decisions.

Ultimately, outside influences can have an impact on our character, but it is our decisions, rather than external influences, that form the foundations of our character.

"Attending classes from home via online or video conferencing can be beneficial for students with busy schedules or extenuating circumstances. Students can take classes at their own pace and have access to classes that may not be available in their local school district. However, attending classes online can also be more challenging than attending physical classes. There are potential distractions such as access to phones and computers, as well as a lack of direct contact with instructors and peers.

Although attending classes online can have its advantages, there are also many benefits to attending school in person. Learning in a physical educational environment can help promote collaboration between students, foster relationships with teachers, and provide opportunities to engage in discussions with peers. Attending classes in person can also prepare students for their future career paths by helping them gain an understanding of a professional environment.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Title: The Four-Day Work Week: Pros, Cons, and a Possible Solution

As an 8th grader, I've always been curious about the idea of a four-day work week. Would it benefit students, workers, and businesses, or would it lead to chaos and disaster? In this essay, I'll investigate the pros and cons of implementing a four-day work week and provide a conclusion with a suggested solution.

Pros of a four-day work week:

1. More time for students: With an extra day off, students would have more time to focus on their studies, extracurricular activities, and personal interests. This could lead to better grades, improved mental health, and a more balanced lifestyle.
2. Reduced commuting time and expenses: By working four days instead of five, workers would save time and money on their daily commutes. This could be especially beneficial for those who rely on public transportation or have long commutes.
3. Increased productivity: With more time to rest and recharge, workers might be more productive and focused during their working hours. This could lead to better work quality and increased output.
4. Competitive advantage for businesses: By offering a four-day work week, businesses could attract top talent and stand out from competitors. This could lead to increased profitability and success.

Cons of a four-day work week:

1. Reduced work hours: With fewer workdays, businesses might struggle to meet demand and complete tasks on time. This could lead to decreased productivity and revenue.
2. Increased costs: While businesses might save on commuting expenses, they might need to invest in additional resources to make up for the lost time. This could include hiring more staff or investing in new technology.
3. Impact on customer service: With fewer workdays, businesses might struggle to provide adequate customer service. This could lead to dissatisfied customers and lost revenue.
4. Social isolation: With an extra day off, workers might feel disconnected from their colleagues and miss out on important social interactions.

Conclusion:

While a four-day work week could offer many benefits, it's important to carefully consider",1,llama2_chat,1
"The idea of changing the duration of public high school from four years to three years has been a topic of debate for a long time. While some people believe that this change would have a positive impact on students, others argue that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of this change for students and identify other factors that could have a significant role in the decision to pursue three years of high school.

One of the main advantages of a three-year high school is that it would allow students to enter the workforce earlier. This would give them the opportunity to start earning money and gaining work experience at a younger age. This could be particularly beneficial for students who come from low-income families or who need to support themselves while in school. Additionally, a shorter high school duration could also reduce the cost of education, as students would be able to graduate and enter the workforce sooner.

However, there are also several disadvantages to a three-year high school. One of the main concerns is that students may not be fully prepared for the workforce. High school is meant to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce, and a shorter high school duration could limit the amount of time students have to develop these skills. Additionally, a shorter high school duration could also limit the amount of time students have to pursue extracurricular activities or to explore their interests.

Another factor that could have a significant role in the decision to pursue three years of high school is the availability of job opportunities. If there are a large number of job opportunities available for students who have only completed three years of high school, it may be more attractive for students to pursue this option. However, if there are few job opportunities available for students who have only completed three years of high school, it may not be as attractive.

In conclusion, the idea of changing the duration of public high school from four years to three years is a complex one. While there are several advantages to a shorter high school duration, there are also several disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision to pursue three years of high school should be based on a careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, as well as other factors such as the availability of job opportunities.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"With many organizations facing budget cuts and an unpredictable economy, more and more businesses and schools are beginning to consider the idea of instituting a 4-day, 10 hour work week or school week. While the idea of having a three-day weekend may seem appealing, there are both pros and cons that must be considered before making this switch. 

One of the main advantages of reducing the work week or school week to four days is the potential cost savings that can be achieved. By making the switch, companies can reduce the amount of energy they use, which can lead to lower bills. Additionally, businesses can save money by reducing the amount of personnel that they need, and schools can save money on things like facility costs and transportation. 

However, there are also numerous disadvantages to instituting such a schedule. For instance, many employees may struggle to stay focused during a 10-hour workday and may find their productivity declining due to exhaustion. Additionally, students in a longer school day may have difficulty staying motivated for the extra two hours each day. 

Ultimately, it is important to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of instituting a 4-day, 10 hour work or school week. Decisions should be made based not only on cost savings, but also on the potential impact that such a schedule could have on productivity, morale, and overall quality of life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Since the dawn of time, people have realized the immense benefits of helping others. By participating in community service, students gain valuable skills and learn more about their community. But, some argue that this should not be a requirement for students, stating that it is too much work. 

On the one hand, community service is a good way for students to develop important skills such as communication, problem solving, and collaboration. It can also lead to improved student engagement and higher success levels since students are actively involved in their community. Moreover, service activities provide a great way to learn more about the world around them and how they can make a difference.

On the other hand, opponents to mandatory community service argue that it is a burden for students, taking away valuable time that could be spent studying or doing other activities. Additionally, it can be a challenge for students to find community service opportunities that align with their interests and that provide meaningful experiences. 

Ultimately, I believe that requiring students to participate in community service can be beneficial--not only teaching students valuable skills, but also providing them with an opportunity to make a positive impact on their community. By mandating community service, students have the opportunity to contribute to their local community in meaningful ways.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

Students can learn teamwork and social skills, have the opportunity to exercise, learn additional skills and compete against one another, and become active members of their school’s community. On the other hand, it is important to consider that this view is not suitable for all students. For some, the commitment and pressures of regular activity may be too great, or they may already be involved in activities outside of school that already fill their schedules. A sensible approach is necessary in which all students are encouraged to participate in as many activities as possible, but no one is left feeling overwhelmed.

"In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our lives. From smartphones to social media, it has revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with each other. While technology has brought many benefits, it has also had a significant impact on our social skills, especially among young generations. In this essay, I will discuss how technology interferes with students' social skills in the classroom, explore bullying on the internet, discuss the dangers of online trolling and fake news posts on social media, and propose methods to reduce the limitation of human contact due to technology.

One of the most significant impacts of technology on social skills is the way it has changed the way we communicate. With the rise of social media and instant messaging, people are now more likely to communicate through screens than in person. This has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which is essential for developing social skills. In the classroom, this can be particularly problematic, as students are less likely to interact with each other and build relationships.

Bullying on the internet is another significant issue that has arisen due to technology. With the rise of social media, it has become easier for bullies to harass and torment their victims. One real-life example of this is the case of Monica Lewinsky, who was subjected to intense bullying and harassment after her affair with former President Bill Clinton. This bullying continued for years, and Lewinsky has since become an advocate for victims of online harassment.

Online trolling and fake news posts on social media are also significant dangers that have arisen due to technology. Trolls are people who intentionally harass and provoke others online, often using fake accounts or multiple accounts to amplify their impact. Fake news posts are another issue, as they can spread false information and incite panic or violence. These dangers have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, and it is essential to be aware of them.

To reduce the limitation of human contact due to technology, there are several methods that can be implemented. One approach is to encourage face-to-face communication in the classroom. Teachers can organize activities that require students to interact with each other, such as group projects or debates. Another approach is to educate students about the dangers of online bullying and harassment, and to provide them with the tools to report and block ab",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"The history of the United States has been shaped by government regulations and an active mindset. Government regulations have played a crucial role in shaping the country's development, from the founding of the United States to the present day. For example, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights established the framework for the government and protected the rights of citizens. In addition, laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act have helped to protect the environment and public health.

However, an active mindset is also essential for the success of the United States. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, famously said, ""I am a firm believer in the power of an active mind to do great things."" This quote highlights the importance of an active mindset in achieving success and making a positive impact on the world.

Unfortunately, idle behavior has caused tragic consequences in the past. For example, the lazy lifestyle of many Americans during the Great Depression contributed to the economic crisis of the time. Similarly, the idle behavior of many young people today has led to a rise in obesity, mental health issues, and other negative outcomes.

Technology has also contributed to the rise of idle behavior. With the advent of smartphones and other digital devices, people are now more sedentary than ever before. Many people spend hours each day scrolling through social media or playing video games, instead of engaging in physical activity or other productive pursuits.

The impact of an idle lifestyle on individuals and the entire United States is significant. Idle behavior can lead to a host of negative health outcomes, including obesity, heart disease, and mental health issues. In addition, an idle lifestyle can contribute to a decline in productivity and economic growth.

To combat the negative effects of idle behavior, it is important to adopt an active mindset. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including exercise, volunteering, and engaging in other productive pursuits. By taking an active approach to life, individuals can improve their health, well-being, and overall quality of life.

In conclusion, the history of the United States has been shaped by government regulations and an active mindset. Thomas Jefferson's quote about the power of an active mind highlights the importance of this mindset in achieving success and making a positive impact on the world.

Okay, so, from what I gathered, Michelangelo was like, a total genius when it comes to art. He painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and stuff, and his sculptures are like, whoa.  But, I guess his quote is trying to say that setting your goals too high can be a bad thing. Like, if you aim too high and don't reach it, you might get discouraged and give up. 

I get what he's saying, I guess. Like, if you set your sights on something that's really hard to achieve, and you don't get it, you might feel like a failure.  But, on the other hand, setting your aim too low and achieving it might not be that satisfying either.  Like, if you only aim for something easy and get it, you might not feel like you've accomplished much. 

I think it's important to find a balance, you know?  Like, set your goals high enough that you have to work hard to achieve them, but not so high that you get discouraged if you don't reach them.  And, you know, it's okay to fall short sometimes. It's like, a learning experience, right? 

So, in conclusion,  I think Michelangelo's quote is trying to say that setting your aim too high can be a danger, but it's not the only danger.  It's important to find a balance and set your goals just right, so you can feel accomplished and motivated to keep trying.  And, you know, maybe one day you'll be as famous as Michelangelo and have your own quote to share with the world!

"The school day is already long, with many students feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to complete. However, some schools are considering adding an additional 90 minutes to the school day. While this may seem like a good idea on the surface, there are several potential impacts that need to be considered before making a decision.

One of the main concerns with adding an additional 90 minutes to the school day is students' alertness. Studies have shown that students' attention spans decrease as the day wears on. Adding an extra 90 minutes to the school day could exacerbate this problem, leading to students becoming more tired and less focused. This could ultimately lead to lower academic performance and a decrease in the quality of education that students receive.

Another factor to consider is teacher workload. Teachers already have a lot of work to do, with lesson planning, grading, and other administrative tasks taking up much of their time. Adding an additional 90 minutes to the school day could put even more pressure on teachers, leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in the quality of teaching that students receive.

Extracurricular activities are also an important consideration. Many students participate in sports, music, or other extracurricular activities outside of school. Adding an additional 90 minutes to the school day could take away from the time that students have for these activities, leading to a decrease in their involvement and participation. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in the overall well-being of students.

Finally, family time is an important factor to consider. Many students have busy schedules outside of school, with family obligations and other commitments taking up much of their time. Adding an additional 90 minutes to the school day could take away from the time that students have for their families, leading to a decrease in their relationships and overall well-being.

In conclusion, while adding an additional 90 minutes to the school day may seem like a good idea on the surface, there are several potential impacts that need to be considered before making a decision.

First off, let's talk about enthusiasm. It's like, super important to be excited about what you're doing, ya know? When you're passionate about something, you're more likely to put in the effort and keep at it. And education is also key. Learning new things and developing your skills can help you achieve your goals and make you a better person. 

But, here's the thing: jealousy and envy can totally get in the way of our success. When others are green with envy, it can make us feel like we're not good enough, and we might start to doubt ourselves. It's like, why can't they just be happy for us?

Working in a group can help you with like, any subject. You can all share your knowledge and expertise and learn from each other. It's like, a win-win situation! 

But, you know, there are also some benefits to working alone.  Like, sometimes you just need some alone time to like, focus and think deeply about something. When you're working alone, you don't have to worry about distractions or other people's opinions, so you can really dive deep into your work and come up with some amazing ideas.

"Often times, we find ourselves self-imposing limitations in areas of our lives where we feel we do not excel, or where we are uncomfortable. This can be detrimental to our own personal growth, both professionally and personally. Dissatisfaction is natural and healthy, as it often encourages us to strive for more and become better versions of ourselves, however it can also be dangerous if taken too far. It is wise to endeavor to constantly learn new things and strive further than our current capabilities -- continually striving for more can help us become more confident, rounded individuals. This is reflected in Emerson's statement that ""we should always be going after growth,"" as people are constantly gaining knowledge and pushing boundaries to reach some semblance of harmony in their lives.

"Growing up, I was constantly told what I should do with my life. From parents to teachers to my peers, I felt like the world was trying to direct me in my own path. Everyone had an opinion – choose this career, don't get too many tattoos, go to the right college – and I felt like I had to follow what I was told. However, over time, I've learned that it's important to stay true to myself and focus on my own goals, regardless of what the world says. 

For example, when I was deciding on a college major, I felt like I had to stick with a ""traditional"" degree, such as engineering or business. But deep down I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in the humanities, an area that many people have often deemed as ""unrealistic."" In the end, I decided to take a risk and completely forgo the advice of others, embracing my love of literature instead. 

By trusting my gut and focusing on my true goals, I have been able to take the necessary steps to succeed in my education and beyond. I have found that it is essential to listen to those around you, while also giving yourself the freedom to make your own decisions. It may be difficult to go against the current, but in the end it is worth it if you remain true to yourself and your own goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Decision-making is an important life skill that has potential implications for someone's future. making decisions independently or seeking guidance from experts and authorities can have both advantages and disadvantages. Seeking external guidance, particularly from trusted and knowledgeable sources, can help someone become better informed in their decision-making and weigh their options. However, reliance on outside help can also lead to an inability to make decisions independently, which can take away an individual's autonomy in their decision-making. 

Take the example of a college student deciding what degree to pursue. If the student solely makes the decision on their own, they may feel more in control and the process more authentic. However, depending largely on their own knowledge may lead them to miss out on other potential options or choices that could have been beneficial to their future. Alternatively, seeking external guidance such as advisors, family, or educational programs can give the student an outside perspective and information not available to them individually. Though seeking outside help can potentially lead to the student feeling less autonomy and sense of freedom, this can be beneficial to their future decision-making as they will be more informed and aware of the process. 

Ultimately, making decisions involves both advantages and disadvantages of independent or external guidance that can affect the individual and their future. These should be weighed against each other prior to reaching a decision to ensure that the choice made is the best option for the individual and their future.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

For example, we have a partnership with a local tech company that offers us internships and job opportunities. They also come to our school to give presentations and workshops on cool tech stuff. It's really helpful for us to learn about the industry and get a feel for what it's like to work in a real workplace.

Another cool partnership we have is with a non-profit organization that focuses on sustainability. They come to our school and teach us about environmental issues and how we can make a difference. They also organize community service projects that we can participate in, like cleaning up parks and waterways. It's really important for us to learn about these issues and take action to make the world a better place.

There are also some local companies that are associated with our school, like a coffee shop that donates a portion of their profits to our school's art program. It's really cool to see how these companies are invested in our school and want to help us succeed.

Now, when it comes to the type of workplace environment that would suit my interests and preferences, I think I would like to work in a place that values sustainability and social responsibility. I'm really passionate about these issues and I think it's important to work for a company that shares my values. I also want to work in a place that has a relaxed and inclusive atmosphere, where I can feel comfortable and happy.

Overall, I think it's really cool that my school has these partnerships and associations with local companies and organizations. It's a great way for us to learn about different industries and make a positive impact on our community. And who knows, maybe one day I'll work for one of these companies and make a difference in the world! 😊",1,llama2_chat,1
"In today's world, individuals' characters are influenced by a multitude of factors, some of which are within their control, while others are not. These influences can shape a person's beliefs, values, and behavior, and can ultimately determine the course of their life. In this essay, I will compare and contrast different influences that shape individuals' characters and discuss whether it is possible for people to choose their own path.

Firstly, genetics and biology play a significant role in shaping individuals' characters. Genetics determine certain traits that are inherent in a person, such as their temperament, personality, and even their physical appearance. These traits can have a significant impact on how a person interacts with the world and can influence their behavior and decision-making. However, it is important to note that genetics do not determine a person's character entirely, and environmental factors can also play a role in shaping an individual's personality.

Secondly, upbringing and family influence are also significant factors in shaping individuals' characters. The values, beliefs, and behavior of a person's parents and caregivers can have a lasting impact on their personality and behavior. For example, a person who grew up in a household that values honesty and integrity may be more likely to exhibit those traits in their own life. However, it is important to note that not all individuals have the same upbringing, and environmental factors such as poverty or abuse can also shape a person's character.

Thirdly, cultural and societal influences can also play a significant role in shaping individuals' characters. Culture and society can influence a person's beliefs, values, and behavior through social norms, media, and education. For example, a person who grows up in a culture that values independence and individualism may be more likely to exhibit those traits in their own life. However, it is important to note that cultural and societal influences can also be limiting, and individuals may feel pressure to conform to certain expectations or beliefs.

Finally, personal experiences and life events can also shape individuals' characters. Traumatic events such as abuse or loss can have a lasting impact on a person's personality and behavior, while positive experiences such as achieving a goal or forming meaningful relationships can also shape a person's character. However, it is important to note that personal experiences and life events are not",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Hey there!  I'm super excited to write this essay about failing and succeeding. It's like, totally relevant to our lives, you know? 

So, I started by researching some successful people and their stories. Like, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, and J.K. Rowling. They're all total rockstars, right?  And I noticed that they all encountered failure at some point in their lives. Like, Oprah was fired from her first job, Steve Jobs got kicked out of college, and J.K. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before someone finally picked up her book. 

But here's the thing: they didn't let failure get them down. They used it as an opportunity to learn and grow. They picked themselves up, dusted themselves off, and kept on going. They showed me that failure is not the end of the world, but rather a stepping stone to success. 

For example, Oprah could have given up after getting fired from her first job. But nope, she used it as a chance to learn and improve. She worked hard, landed a new job, and eventually became one of the most successful talk show hosts ever. 

Steve Jobs got kicked out of college, but he didn't let that stop him from pursuing his dreams. He dropped out, started a company, and created some of the most innovative products ever. 

And J.K. Rowling got rejected by 12 publishers, but she didn't give up. She kept writing, and eventually got her book published. And now, she's one of the most successful authors in the world. 

I realized that failure is not something to be afraid of, but something to embrace. It helps us learn more about ourselves and what we're capable of. It teaches us to be resilient, to persevere, and to never give up on our dreams. 

So, my conclusion is that failure is not the opposite of success, but rather a part of it. It's like, the obstacles",1,llama2_chat,2
"The Importance of Using a Writing Checklist

As an eighth-grade student, I am constantly working on my writing skills. Whether it's for a school assignment, a creative project, or a personal essay, writing is an important part of my life. However, as a writer, it can be challenging to know what to include and what to leave out of my work. This is where a writing checklist comes in handy.

A writing checklist is a tool that helps writers organize their thoughts and ideas before they start writing. It is a list of items or questions that a writer should consider before they start writing. These items can include things like the purpose of the writing, the target audience, the tone of the writing, and the structure of the writing.

Using a writing checklist is important because it helps writers to focus on the most important aspects of their writing. By considering these items before they start writing, writers can ensure that their work is clear, concise, and effective. Additionally, using a writing checklist can help writers to identify potential problems or weaknesses in their work, which they can then address before they submit it.

One of the main arguments for using a writing checklist is that it can help writers to save time. By considering the important aspects of their writing before they start writing, writers can avoid going back and making changes later on. This can save time and reduce the amount of stress and frustration that comes with the writing process.

Another argument for using a writing checklist is that it can help writers to improve the quality of their work. By considering the important aspects of their writing before they start writing, writers can ensure that their work is well-organized, easy to understand, and effectively communicates their message. This can help writers to receive better feedback from their readers and to achieve their writing goals.

However, not everyone agrees that using a writing checklist is important. Some people argue that it can stifle creativity and limit the writer's ability to think outside the box. Additionally, some people argue that using a writing checklist can be time-consuming and can take away from the enjoyment of the writing process.

In conclusion, using a writing checklist is an important tool for writers. It can help writers to focus on the most important aspects of their writing, save time, and improve the quality of their work. While there are some valid",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Failure: The Silent Teacher

 Failure. The word itself can send shivers down the spine of even the most confident individual. It's a word that can evoke feelings of disappointment, frustration, and self-doubt. But, is failure really a negative thing? In my opinion, failure is one of the most valuable experiences we can have in life. It's a silent teacher, guiding us towards success and growth.

Personally, I've experienced my fair share of failures. From bombing a test in math class to not making the basketball team, I've felt the sting of defeat. But, looking back, I realize that those failures were some of the most important experiences of my life. They taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, resilience, and self-motivation.

For instance, when I didn't make the basketball team, I was devastated. I had put in so much time and effort, and yet, I still came up short. But, instead of giving up, I used that failure as motivation to work even harder. I started practicing every day, pushing myself to be better. And, the next year, I made the team.

Similarly, when I bombed that math test, I felt like a total failure. But, I didn't let that one setback hold me back. I studied even harder, and my next test score improved significantly. I learned that failure is not the end of the world, but rather a stepping stone towards success.

The role of self-motivation in using failure as an opportunity to grow and succeed cannot be overstated. When we fail, we have two choices: we can let it discourage us, or we can use it as fuel to push ourselves harder. The latter is exactly what I did. I realized that I had the power to turn my failures into successes.

In conclusion, failure is not something to be feared or avoided. It's an inevitable part of life that can teach us valuable lessons and help us grow. By embracing failure and using it as an opportunity to learn and improve, we can turn what seems like a negative experience into a positive one. So, the next time you fail, don't give up.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Title: Inspired to Make a Change

As I sat in my history class, listening to my teacher talk about the civil rights movement, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and admiration for the brave individuals who fought for equality and justice. Their stories of resilience and determination inspired me to make a change in my own life.

I couldn't help but think of my own experiences and how I could make a difference. Growing up, I had always been aware of the racial tensions in my community, but I never really knew how to address them. I had always felt like an outsider, like I didn't quite belong. But after learning about the struggles of those who came before me, I realized that I had the power to make a difference.

I started small, by speaking up when I witnessed racist behavior and educating my friends and family about the importance of inclusivity and respect. It wasn't easy, and there were definitely times when I felt like giving up. But every time I heard a success story of someone who had stood up for what was right, no matter the cost, I felt a surge of determination.

One person who really stood out to me was Rosa Parks. Her courage and conviction in the face of oppression inspired me to take a stand, even when it was hard. I realized that I didn't have to be a leader or a hero to make a difference, I just had to be willing to listen and learn.

Learning about the experiences of others has inspired me to make a change in my own life. I've learned that even the smallest actions can have a big impact, and that standing up for what is right is always worth it. I may not be able to single-handedly change the world, but I can definitely make a difference in my own community. And who knows, maybe one day I'll be the one inspiring others to make a change.",1,llama2_chat,0
"As an 8th-grade student, I have been considering the possibility of attending a year-round school. While some people believe that year-round schools have many advantages, others argue that they have more disadvantages. In this essay, I will research and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of attending a year-round school.

One of the main advantages of attending a year-round school is that it allows students to have more opportunities to learn. With a traditional school year of 180 days, students have a limited amount of time to learn new concepts and skills. However, year-round schools typically have a longer school year of around 365 days. This means that students have more time to learn and retain new information. Additionally, year-round schools often offer more specialized courses and programs, allowing students to explore their interests and passions in more depth.

Another advantage of attending a year-round school is that it can help students stay on track academically. With a longer school year, students have more time to catch up on any missed work and get ahead of their peers. This can be especially helpful for students who struggle academically or who have fallen behind due to extracurricular activities or other commitments. Additionally, year-round schools often have smaller class sizes, which can provide more individualized attention and support for students.

However, there are also some disadvantages to attending a year-round school. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be more stressful for students and their families. With a longer school year, students may feel overwhelmed and burnt out. Additionally, year-round schools often require more commitment from families, as they need to plan their schedules around the school calendar. This can be challenging for families with other obligations, such as work or sports.

Another disadvantage of attending a year-round school is that it can be more expensive. Year-round schools often require more resources and funding, which can lead to higher tuition costs. Additionally, families may need to purchase more school supplies and materials, as they will be attending school for a longer period of time.

In conclusion, attending a year-round school has both advantages and disadvantages. While year-round schools offer more opportunities to learn and stay on track academically, they can also be more stressful and expensive for students and their families. Ultimately",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey there!  So, I'm gonna write this essay on the benefits of having a positive attitude in life. 

First off, let's talk about how having a positive attitude can help you overcome obstacles. Like, think about it, when you're faced with a challenge, if you're all like ""YOLO, let's do this!"" instead of ""Ugh, this is gonna be so hard..."", you're way more likely to tackle it head-on and come out on top.  It's like, if you have a positive mindset, you're more likely to find a solution than if you're all negative and stuff.

And it's not just about overcoming obstacles, having a positive attitude can also help you in your job and personal relationships. Like, if you're all positive and stuff, people are way more likely to wanna work with you and hang out with you. It's like, if you're all ""Hey, let's make this work!"" instead of ""Ugh, this is gonna be so hard..."", people are way more likely to be like ""Yeah, let's do it!"" 

And then there's the power of believing in yourself. Like, if you believe in yourself, you can do anything!  It's like, if you're all ""I can do this!"" instead of ""Ugh, I don't know if I can do this..."", you're way more likely to succeed.  And it's not just about school stuff, it's about life stuff too. Like, if you believe in yourself, you're way more likely to make good choices and stuff.

And finally, having a positive attitude can sometimes be the key to success. Like, think about it, if you're all positive and stuff, you're way more likely to take risks and try new things. And that's how you find success, by taking risks and trying new things!

"Being active and working towards a goal can be highly beneficial for individuals of all ages. While it may seem counterintuitive, being always busy and striving for something can have a positive impact on our mental and physical health.

Firstly, being active and working towards a goal can help us to stay focused and motivated. When we have a clear objective in mind, we are more likely to stay on track and avoid getting sidetracked by distractions. This can lead to increased productivity and a sense of accomplishment, which can boost our self-esteem and confidence.

Secondly, being active and working towards a goal can also help us to develop important skills such as time management, problem-solving, and perseverance. These skills can be applied to other areas of our lives, such as school, work, and personal relationships.

For example, consider a student who is working towards a goal of getting good grades in school. By staying focused and motivated, they are able to manage their time effectively, prioritize their studies, and seek help when needed. This can lead to improved academic performance and a greater sense of achievement.

Furthermore, being active and working towards a goal can also have a positive impact on our physical health. Exercise and physical activity have been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and boost energy levels. By staying busy and active, we can also reduce the risk of developing chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

In conclusion, while it may seem counterintuitive, being always busy and striving for something can be highly beneficial for individuals of all ages. By staying focused, motivated, and active, we can develop important skills, improve our mental and physical health, and achieve our goals. So, the next time you feel overwhelmed or unsure of what to do, remember that being active and working towards a goal can be the key to success.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" is a powerful statement that speaks to the importance of individuality in a society that often values conformity. In today's world, where people are constantly bombarded with messages about what they should look like, what they should wear, and what they should believe, it can be challenging to stay true to oneself. However, as Emerson suggests, the greatest accomplishment is to resist these pressures and to embrace one's own unique identity.

One example of the importance of individuality is seen in the world of art. Throughout history, artists have been celebrated for their ability to create works that are true to their own vision, even when faced with criticism and rejection. For example, Vincent van Gogh's use of bold, vibrant colors and swirling brushstrokes in his paintings was seen as controversial and even madness by some during his lifetime. However, today, his works are celebrated for their unique beauty and emotional depth. Similarly, Pablo Picasso's groundbreaking Cubist style was met with skepticism and resistance at first, but it has since become one of the most influential art movements in history.

Another example of the importance of individuality is seen in the world of business. Entrepreneurs who have succeeded by following their own unique vision and creating a product or service that meets a specific need or desire have changed the world. For example, Steve Jobs' vision for Apple Inc. was to create a company that focused on design and innovation, rather than just following the latest trends. This approach led to the creation of products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which revolutionized the music and technology industries.

In addition to these examples, there are countless others throughout history and in the present day where individuals have achieved great success by staying true to themselves. Whether it's in art, business, or any other field, the greatest accomplishments come from those who have the courage to follow their own unique path, even in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" is a powerful reminder of the importance of individuality in a society that often values conformity.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"A positive attitude is a powerful tool that can have far reaching effects on one's life and can even have a positive impact on the world around them. Having a positive attitude in the workplace can benefit both co-workers and employers. A positive attitude can improve productivity, create a positive work environment, and even influence the motivation levels of other employees. Its effects on daily life are far-reaching and can have profound impacts on self-esteem, communication, relationships, decision-making, and mental health. Respect is an integral part of having a positive attitude, and those who cultivate feelings of respect for those around them are often seen as happier and more successful.

When comparing and contrasting the effects of a positive attitude against a negative attitude, one must consider how these two attitudes can affect a person's ability to think, act, and succeed. Generally speaking, having a positive attitude can lead to a greater feeling of accomplishment, better physical and mental health, enhanced social relationships, and improved decision-making abilities. On the other hand, a negative attitude can lead to feelings of depression, low self-esteem, unhealthy relationships, and a lack of ambition.

When faced with the choice to have a positive or negative attitude, it can be argued that having a positive attitude is the most beneficial route to take. Positive attitudes can help shape a more successful life, and in turn, a more successful world. Therefore, it is completely worth the effort to strive for and maintain a positive attitude.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey, it's me, like, totally stoked to be writing this essay about making good first impressions! 😃 It's totally important to make a good first impression, like, in any situation, whether it's at school, at a job interview, or even on social media. 📱📸

So, like, let's talk about personality first. When you meet someone for the first time, you want to make sure you come across as friendly and approachable. If you're, like, super shy or awkward, it can be hard for people to want to hang out with you or get to know you better. But if you're, like, super outgoing and bubbly, people are more likely to be drawn to you and want to be your friend. 🤩

And then there's actions. Like, you want to make sure you're not, like, totally clumsy or disrespectful when you first meet someone. If you spill food on someone's shirt or, like, accidentally knock over a lamp, it can be, like, super embarrassing and make a bad impression. But if you're, like, super careful and considerate, people will think you're, like, super thoughtful and caring. 💖

"In recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether high schools should offer a three-year program instead of the traditional four-year program. While some argue that a three-year program would be beneficial for students, others believe that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will investigate the motivations, qualifications, and advantages of offering a three-year high school program, as well as the potential drawbacks and disadvantages.

One of the main motivations for offering a three-year program is to provide students with an opportunity to enter the workforce sooner. By completing high school in three years, students would be able to start earning a salary and gaining valuable work experience at an earlier age. This could be particularly beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a career that requires practical experience, such as construction or manufacturing.

Another advantage of a three-year program is that it would reduce the cost of education for students and their families. With a shorter high school program, students would be able to graduate and enter the workforce sooner, which could help to reduce the amount of student loan debt they would accrue. Additionally, a shorter high school program would mean that students would be able to start earning a salary sooner, which could help to alleviate some of the financial pressures that many families face.

However, there are also potential drawbacks and disadvantages to offering a three-year high school program. One of the main concerns is that a shorter high school program may not provide students with enough time to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in college or the workforce. While some students may be able to complete their coursework in three years, others may need more time to master certain concepts or to pursue additional interests or extracurricular activities.

Another potential disadvantage of a three-year program is that it may not be as attractive to colleges and employers. Many colleges and employers require a four-year high school diploma as a minimum qualification, and a three-year diploma may not be seen as equivalent. This could limit the opportunities available to students who choose to pursue a three-year program, and could make it more difficult for them to advance in their careers.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to offering a three-year high school program. While a shorter program could provide students with an opportunity to",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"I still remember the first time I encountered my supervisor in the office. At first, I was too intimidated to even introduce myself properly. I had heard about her from other colleagues and was aware of her strict attitude regarding work. When I looked into her eyes, I suddenly felt the pressure to step up my game and be more productive. She had the kind of impression that made me think twice before I acted on my assumptions. It was not just the way she looked at me, but also the way she dealt with all the issues that made me adjust my attitude. 

I realized how more significant relationships and inner qualities were more influential in a person's attitude than first impressions. My previous boss made me do things with the utmost care and diligence, while my supervisor created an atmosphere that enabled me to think more out of the box and build my creative skills. 

The most important change I went through was gaining more confidence in myself and my work. Before this change, I was always stressed out and scared to take any risks. With the help of my supervisor, I now feel more prepared and able to take on risks. 

These experiences have taught me important lessons and it has certainly shaped the way I treat others and the first impressions I make. Over time, I have realized that it is essential to take the time to get to know someone before making any conclusions.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Virginia has a rich and diverse history that is worth exploring. There are many museums and parks that offer visitors a unique glimpse into the past. In this essay, I will discuss some of the top museums and parks in Virginia that are perfect for a vacation.

The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. is one of the most popular museums in Virginia. It features a wide range of exhibits, including the Wright Brothers' airplane, the Apollo 11 command module, and the Space Shuttle Discovery. Visitors can also explore the museum's interactive exhibits, which allow them to learn more about the history and science of flight.

Another great museum in Virginia is the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. This museum features a vast collection of art from around the world, including works by famous artists such as Monet, Picasso, and Warhol. Visitors can also take advantage of the museum's educational programs, which include guided tours, workshops, and lectures.

For those who love nature, the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia is a must-visit. This park features stunning natural beauty, including waterfalls, hiking trails, and wildlife. Visitors can also take advantage of the park's educational programs, which include ranger-led talks, guided hikes, and interpretive exhibits.

In addition to museums and parks, Virginia also offers a variety of educational programs for students during vacation. For example, many schools offer field trips to historical sites and museums, which can be a great way for students to learn about Virginia's history. Some schools also offer summer camps that focus on outdoor education, science, and technology.

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important for teachers to take advantage of vacation days during school breaks. This can be a great opportunity for teachers to recharge and refresh, which can ultimately lead to better teaching and more engaged students. Additionally, teachers can use vacation days to take advantage of educational opportunities and learn new skills, which can benefit their students in the long run.

These attractions offer visitors a unique glimpse into the past and provide educational opportunities for both visitors and students.

"As humans, we are constantly evaluating, learning, and growing through our experiences. It can be said that our past experiences shape our future first impressions, either through how we prepare ourselves or how we interpret the reactions and feelings of those around us. This can be crucial when it comes to embarrassing situations that can happen in social settings. Every individual has their own set of experiences that shape them, and therefore, the ability to better prepare for these situations will depend on acknowledging our past experiences and using them to form our future actions. Taking lessons from the past situations and feeling comfortable enough to properly apply them can be the difference between being more confident and successful in our first impressions, or perpetuating embarrassing, and sometimes embarrassing, situations. The goal then to is to learn from past experiences in order to gain the necessary skills to successfully stand up to and prepare for potential embarrassing situations.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 😃

Okay, so I know you said we're supposed to write an essay on why imagination is important for knowledge, but like, have you ever just thought about it? 🤔 Like, it's like, totally crucial! 🔥

First of all, imagine if we didn't have imagination. Like, we wouldn't be able to dream up new ideas or invent new things! 🚀 Can you imagine a world without smartphones or video games? 😳 It would be so boring! Imagination helps us come up with new and better ways of doing things, and that's how we make progress.

And it's not just about inventions, Mrs. J. Imagination also helps us understand things better. Like, if we didn't use our imagination to visualize things, we wouldn't be able to understand them as well. For example, if I was trying to explain a complicated science concept to my little brother, but I didn't use any visual aids, he wouldn't be able to understand it as well. But if I used my imagination to draw a picture or create a video, he would be way more likely to get it! 💡

And have you heard of the story of Albert Einstein, Mrs. J? 🤔 He was a scientist who imagined all sorts of crazy things, like how time and space were connected. And then he used his imagination to figure out how to prove it! 🔮 That's how he came up with his theory of relativity! 🚀

So, like, in conclusion, imagination is super important for knowledge because it helps us come up with new ideas, understand things better, and make progress. 💡🔥 So, let's all try to use our imaginations more often, okay? 😃 Thanks for reading, Mrs. J! 👍",1,llama2_chat,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that learning how to fix cars and tune a computer for an engine, understanding basic physics and equations, and practicing playing shooter video games are all important skills to acquire. While these may seem like unrelated topics, I believe that they are all interconnected and can help me become a more well-rounded individual.

Firstly, learning how to fix cars and tune a computer for an engine is an important skill to have. Not only does it allow me to save money by doing my own repairs, but it also teaches me about the inner workings of machines. This knowledge can be applied to other areas of my life, such as understanding how to fix other machines or even how to build my own. Additionally, working on cars and computers can help me develop problem-solving skills, as I will need to diagnose and fix issues that arise.

Secondly, understanding basic physics and equations is also crucial. Physics is the foundation of many aspects of our lives, from the way our cars move to the way our bodies function. By understanding the principles of physics, I can better understand how the world works and make more informed decisions. Additionally, learning equations can help me solve problems and make calculations in various fields, such as engineering or finance.

Lastly, playing shooter video games can help me become faster and more accurate with reactions. While this may seem like a frivolous activity, I believe that it can have real-world benefits. For example, playing shooter games can help me develop quick reflexes and improve my hand-eye coordination. Additionally, many games require strategic thinking and problem-solving, which can help me develop these skills in other areas of my life.

In conclusion, I believe that learning how to fix cars and tune a computer for an engine, understanding basic physics and equations, and practicing playing shooter video games are all important skills to acquire. While they may seem unrelated, they are all interconnected and can help me become a more well-rounded individual. By developing these skills, I can improve my problem-solving abilities, save money, and become a more informed and coordinated individual.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"As individuals, we are all faced with the destiny of having to choose our own character traits. With the ever-shifting nature of the world, it is vital to be able to pick what elements of our personality are ours and which ones we should discard for the betterment of ourselves and those around us. The Victorian biologist, John Lubbock, sums up this idea beautifully when he said, ""In the long run, we shape our lives, and we shape ourselves. The process never ends until we die. And the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility.""

This sentiment is strengthened when we look at our own personal experiences. It is all too easy to be pulled into trends and succumb to societal pressures that shape our character. But if we step back and take our lives into our own hands, we can decide exactly who we want to be. We have the power in ourselves to pick and choose the traits that will create a strong and positive person. This could mean never settling for mediocrity and striving to reach our goals and push our boundaries, or it could mean never giving up on our beliefs and maintaining our sense of integrity. It could also mean being kind and compassionate, lending an ear to those who need it and a hand to those who are struggling. Ultimately, it is up to us to choose these traits and create a unique life full of potential.

In conclusion, it bears repeating that the power to choose our own character traits lies within us. We have the power to shape our lives and our character. With this power, we can choose to become the best version of ourselves, a bettering of our previous self and a new take on our own reality. Despite what trends, society, or anyone else may try to impose on us, it is up to us to choose our own character and live with the consequences of our actions.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"First impressions are not always accurate because they are based on a limited amount of information. People often judge others based on their appearance, body language, and initial behavior, which may not accurately reflect their true character or abilities. Additionally, people may have preconceived notions or biases that can influence their first impressions.

To counteract first impressions that are not accurate, it is important to get to know the person better. This can be done by asking questions, observing their behavior over time, and seeking feedback from others. It is also important to be aware of one's own biases and to actively work to overcome them.

Another way to counteract first impressions is to focus on building positive relationships with others. This can be done by being friendly, open, and genuine in interactions. It is also important to be patient and understanding, as it can take time for people to open up and reveal their true selves.

In conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate and can be influenced by a variety of factors. To counteract inaccurate first impressions, it is important to get to know the person better, be aware of one's own biases, and focus on building positive relationships. By doing so, we can foster more accurate and meaningful connections with others.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"While online classes offer the convenience of being able to access course materials and lectures without having to attend in-person classes, they can also have some disadvantages for students. One of the biggest challenges with virtual learning is that it is easy to get distracted and not pay attention for the duration of the lecture. This can cause students to miss important points and comprehension of the material being discussed. Furthermore, not taking notes can also have a negative effect on learning, as it is critical for students to capture all relevant information and ideas from the lecture to be able to process it later. 

Online classes can be difficult for some students because of the self-discipline that is required in order to effectively learn and retain information. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult to build a sense of community within the classroom, which can be beneficial to many students. Additionally, it can be difficult to have meaningful discussions with classmates over the internet, which can limit opportunities for critical thinking and collaboration. 

Overall, while online classes have the potential to provide students with convenience and flexibility when it comes to their education, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. If students are unable to stay focused and take notes, they may not get the full educational experience that is available in an in-person setting. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult for students to build meaningful connections. Consequently, online classes may not be a beneficial choice for all students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an average 8th grade student, I have been tasked with researching the debate surrounding the idea of finishing high school in three years. After conducting extensive research and analyzing the potential issues that could arise, I have come to the conclusion that while shortening the high school program may have some benefits, it is not the most beneficial option for students.

One of the main arguments in favor of finishing high school in three years is that it would allow students to enter the workforce or college earlier. This could be particularly beneficial for students who are eager to start their careers or further their education as soon as possible. However, there are several potential issues that could arise if all high schools were to undertake this program.

Firstly, shortening the high school program could result in a lack of depth in certain subjects. With less time to cover the curriculum, students may not have the opportunity to explore their interests and develop a deeper understanding of certain subjects. This could lead to a lack of preparation for college or the workforce, where students are expected to have a more comprehensive understanding of their chosen field.

Secondly, shortening the high school program could lead to a lack of socialization and extracurricular activities. High school is not just about academics; it is also a time for students to develop their social skills, make new friends, and participate in extracurricular activities. By cutting short the high school program, students may miss out on these important aspects of their development.

Thirdly, shortening the high school program could have a negative impact on student motivation and engagement. Students who are able to take their time to explore their interests and develop their skills may be more motivated and engaged in their learning. By rushing through the curriculum, students may feel disconnected from their education and less invested in their academic success.

In order to successfully change the high school curriculum, there are several responsibilities that must be taken. Firstly, schools must ensure that the changes made to the curriculum are aligned with state and national standards. This will ensure that students are adequately prepared for college or the workforce. Secondly, schools must communicate the changes to students, parents, and teachers in a clear and transparent manner. This will help to alleviate any concerns or resistance to the changes.",1,llama2_chat,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a four-day school week has its advantages and disadvantages. While it can help conserve energy and resources, it can also limit the time students have to participate in extracurricular activities, work, and help with younger siblings. In this essay, I will discuss the disadvantages of having a four-day school week and compare them to the benefits.

One of the main disadvantages of having a four-day school week is that students may not have enough time to participate in extracurricular activities. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other activities outside of school, and having an extra day off can make it difficult to balance these activities with their academic responsibilities. For example, if a student is on a sports team that practices three days a week, having an extra day off can make it challenging for them to keep up with their practice schedule and maintain their performance level. This can lead to missed opportunities to develop new skills and build relationships with their teammates.

Another disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that students may not have enough time to work. Many students have part-time jobs or internships, and having an extra day off can make it difficult for them to balance their work responsibilities with their academic ones. For example, if a student works 20 hours per week and has a four-day school week, they may struggle to complete their workload in time for their shift. This can lead to missed opportunities to gain valuable work experience and build their resume.

Finally, having a four-day school week can also limit the time students have to help with younger siblings. Many students have younger siblings who rely on them for care and support, and having an extra day off can make it difficult for them to balance their responsibilities at home with their academic ones. For example, if a student has a younger sibling who needs help with homework or other tasks, having an extra day off can make it difficult for them to provide the necessary support. This can lead to missed opportunities to develop important family relationships and responsibilities.

While having a four-day school week has its advantages, such as energy conservation and reduced resources used, it also has its disadvantages. Students may not have enough time to participate in extracurricular activities, work, or help with younger siblings. It",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Hey there!  So, you know how they say ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away""? Well, it's actually a whole bunch of different foods that can keep us healthy! 🥕🥗🍎

Research shows that eating a variety of foods can provide our bodies with all the nutrients it needs to function properly. For example, leafy greens like spinach and kale are packed with vitamins and minerals that help keep our bones strong and our eyes healthy. 🥑🥦 And let's not forget about the amazing benefits of omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish like salmon and tuna! 🐟🍣

But here's the thing: a lot of schools' cafeteria food can be, well, let's just say... not the healthiest. 🙅‍♂️🍔🥤 It's like they're missing out on all these amazing nutrients that could be keeping us healthy and strong! 💪

So, if I were in charge of the school cafeteria, I would totally mix things up! 💁‍♀️ I would make sure to include more fruits and veggies, and less processed foods like hot dogs and pizza. And don't even get me started on the importance of drinking plenty of water! 💧

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what about the kids who love the existing cafeteria food? Won't they be sad if they don't get their favorite burgers and fries?"" 🤔 And to that, I say... 🤷‍♀️ There are so many delicious and healthy options out there that kids might actually enjoy! 😋 Think about it: sweet potatoes are a great source of fiber and vitamins, and they're super tasty when roasted! 🥔🍜 And have you tried quinoa?

"Morals, social class, and people play a crucial role in building character. Each of these factors shapes a person's values, beliefs, and actions, ultimately influencing their overall character. In this essay, we will explore the significance of these three elements and how they contribute to the formation of a person's character.

Morals are the principles and values that guide a person's behavior. They are the foundation of a person's character and help them to make decisions that are right and wrong. Morals are learned from a variety of sources, including family, religion, and society. A person's moral compass is shaped by the values and beliefs that are instilled in them by their family, community, and culture. For example, a person may learn that honesty, kindness, and respect are important values from their parents and teachers. These moral principles help to shape a person's character and guide them to make ethical decisions throughout their life.

Social class also plays a significant role in building character. A person's social class can affect their access to resources, opportunities, and experiences, which can shape their values and beliefs. For example, a person from a lower socioeconomic background may value hard work and perseverance, as they may have to work harder to achieve their goals. On the other hand, a person from a higher socioeconomic background may value education and achievement, as they may have more opportunities to pursue their dreams. Social class can also affect a person's sense of entitlement and their willingness to help others.

People also play a crucial role in building character. The relationships and interactions that a person has with others can shape their values and beliefs. For example, a person who has a positive relationship with their parents may learn the importance of kindness, respect, and empathy. A person who has a negative relationship with their peers may learn the importance of standing up for themselves and their beliefs. People can also influence a person's sense of identity and their beliefs about themselves and the world around them.

In conclusion, morals, social class, and people all play a significant role in building character. Each of these factors shapes a person's values, beliefs, and actions, ultimately influencing their overall character. It is important to recognize the impact of these factors on a person's character development and to strive to make positive changes in our own",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Homework Club: A Win-Win for Students and Teachers

As an 8th grader, I believe that having a homework club after school can bring numerous benefits to both students and teachers. While some may argue that homework is a burden, I firmly believe that a homework club can actually enhance the learning experience and create a more productive environment.

Firstly, a homework club can provide students with a structured and supportive environment to complete their assignments. This can be particularly helpful for students who may struggle with completing their homework on their own, as they can receive guidance and support from their peers and teachers. This can also foster a sense of community and collaboration among students, as they work together to complete their assignments.

Secondly, a homework club can help teachers by reducing the workload on their shoulders. Teachers often have to spend a significant amount of time during class time helping students with their homework, which can be time-consuming and exhausting. By having a homework club, teachers can free up some of their time to focus on other important tasks, such as lesson planning and grading. This can ultimately lead to a more productive and efficient learning environment.

Furthermore, a homework club can also help students develop important skills such as time management, organization, and responsibility. By having a set time and place to complete their homework, students can learn how to prioritize their tasks and manage their time effectively. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may struggle with procrastination and distractions at home.

In addition, a homework club can also provide an opportunity for students to receive additional support and feedback on their assignments. Teachers can provide guidance and answer questions, which can help students better understand the material and improve their understanding of the subject. This can ultimately lead to better grades and a more fulfilling learning experience.

In conclusion, a homework club can bring numerous benefits to both students and teachers. By providing a structured and supportive environment for students to complete their assignments, teachers can free up time to focus on other important tasks, and students can develop important skills such as time management and responsibility. Overall, a homework club can enhance the learning experience and create a more productive environment for everyone involved.",1,llama2_chat,2
"Setting a good example is an effective way of influencing others, as opposed to authoritarian and traditional methods of control. People of all ages respond positively to visible demonstrations of good behaviour. Seeing someone else set a good example encourages others to follow suite. It triggers the urge to mimic that behaviour and the person setting the example becomes a role model, thereby setting off a chain reaction. 

In contrast, authoritarian and traditional methods of control are often met with resentment and frustration. As evidenced by numerous psychological studies, individuals struggle to accept and act upon instructions that are imposed on them. Not surprisingly, they also find it difficult to embrace any positive behaviour derived from such enforced rules and regulations. 

The effectiveness of setting a good example therefore should not be underestimated. As an influential tool, it has the power to positively affect the behaviour of a large group of people. Furthermore, it can also inspire greatness within them by triggering a sense of responsibility and integrity.  To conclude, setting a good example is an effective way of inspiring and influencing others and should be employed whenever possible.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that changing the school policy to require students have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities would have both positive and negative effects on students, educators, and other stakeholders.

On the one hand, requiring a minimum B average to participate in sports or other activities would motivate students to work harder academically. Students would understand that their grades have a direct impact on their ability to participate in activities they enjoy, and they would be more likely to prioritize their studies. This could lead to a higher overall academic performance, which would benefit students in the long run.

Furthermore, this policy would help to ensure that students who participate in sports or other activities are genuinely committed to their academic pursuits. Students who struggle academically may be more likely to drop out of sports or other activities, which could lead to a lack of discipline and responsibility. By requiring a minimum B average, students would be more likely to take their studies seriously and commit to both their academic and extracurricular pursuits.

On the other hand, requiring a minimum B average to participate in sports or other activities could have negative consequences for students who may not have the academic ability to maintain a B average. These students may feel excluded from activities they enjoy and may be less likely to participate in other extracurricular activities. This could lead to a lack of socialization and a sense of belonging among these students, which could have long-term negative effects on their mental health and well-being.

Additionally, this policy could put a strain on educators, who would be responsible for monitoring students' grades and ensuring that they meet the minimum requirement. This could take away from their time and resources, which could negatively impact their ability to provide quality instruction to students.

In conclusion, while requiring a minimum B average to participate in sports or other activities may have some positive effects, it could also have negative consequences for students, educators, and other stakeholders. Ultimately, I believe that schools should consider alternative policies that motivate students to prioritize their studies while also allowing for participation in extracurricular activities for all students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0

First of all, when you're doing poorly in school, you're not gonna be able to focus on anything else, like, at all. And if you're out there playing sports or joining clubs and stuff, you're gonna be like, totally distracted and not pay attention to your schoolwork. And that's just, like, not cool.

Pros and Cons of Attending School versus Traditional Distance Learning

As an 8th grader, I've been thinking a lot about the different ways students can learn. Some kids go to school every day, while others learn from home through distance learning. My parents are always talking about how they wish they could homeschool me, but I think I would miss out on too much if I didn't go to school. So, I decided to research the pros and cons of attending school versus traditional distance learning to see which one is better.

One of the biggest pros of attending school is that you get to hang out with your friends all day. I love seeing my friends every day and learning with them. It's way more fun than sitting at home alone. Plus, you get to play with toys and do fun activities in class, like science experiments or art projects. You also get to have recess and play games with your friends. That's way more fun than sitting at a desk all day.

Another pro of attending school is that you get to develop your social skills. When you're at school, you have to work with other kids and learn how to share and take turns. You also learn how to be a good friend and how to be in a group. These are really important skills that you need to know how to do when you grow up. If you don't learn them in school, you might have trouble making friends or working with others when you're older.

On the other hand, some people say that distance learning is better because you can learn at your own pace. If you're really good at math, you can move ahead and learn more challenging things. And if you're not good at math, you can take your time and practice until you get it right. Plus, you don't have to worry about getting bullied or feeling left out if you're shy.

But, I think distance learning is not as good as going to school. Even though you can learn at your own pace, you don't get to hang out with your friends or play with toys. And, you don't get to have recess or play games with",1,llama2_chat,1
"When it comes to making important decisions, it is often beneficial to seek counsel from multiple sources. Asking for advice from a variety of people can provide insight into different perspectives and ideas that may have otherwise been overlooked. Asking for advice from friends, family members, and mentors can be very empowering as it can give necessary support and practical guidance. 

The input of those around us can provide valuable information that’s not accessible in single-source research. Different pieces of advice and opinions can help us understand the situation from multiple angles and draw conclusions or make decisions in a thorough manner. After gathering advice from multiple sources, we can reflect on the counsel we’ve received and develop best possible solutions to our problems. 

Moreover, asking for advice can serve as a helpful reminder that navigating life’s challenges cannot be done alone. This simple act of seeking guidance can help build self-confidence and resilience and likewise, impart knowledge and wisdom from those who’ve gone through similar experiences. By leveraging the valuable insights of the people around us, we can make choices that ultimately have a positive impact on our lives. 

In summary, it is advantageous to seek advice from multiple people in order to gain useful and unique perspectives that can help us make better, informed decisions. In doing so, not only will we learn which choices lead to success, but we can also develop meaningful connections with the people that are around us.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of extending the school day by 30 minutes as an average 8th grade student:

Extending the school day by 30 minutes has been a topic of discussion in our school for quite some time now. While some people think it's a great idea, others are against it. As an 8th grader, I think it's important to weigh the pros and cons of this proposal.

One of the main benefits of extending the school day is that it would give us more time to learn. With an extra 30 minutes in the day, we could cover more material in our classes, especially in subjects like math and science where we need more time to practice problems and conduct experiments. Additionally, we could have more time for extracurricular activities, which are important for our overall development. For example, we could have more time for sports, music, or art classes, which can help us develop our talents and interests.

However, there are also some drawbacks to extending the school day. One of the biggest concerns is that it could be detrimental to our mental and physical health. Students already have a lot of pressure on them to perform well academically, and adding more time to the school day could make things even more stressful. We could also have less time for extracurricular activities outside of school, which are important for our well-being and social development. Furthermore, some students may have after-school jobs or other commitments that could be affected by the extended school day.

Another concern is that extending the school day could lead to overcrowding in our classes. With more students in the school, we may not get the individual attention we need from our teachers, which could negatively impact our learning experience. Additionally, the school may not be able to provide adequate resources and facilities to accommodate the increased number of students.

In conclusion, while extending the school day by 30 minutes could provide us with more time to learn, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks. We need to make sure that any changes to the school day are made with the well-being and success of students in mind. Maybe we could have a staggered schedule where some students attend school for the full day",1,llama2_chat,2
"In today's digital world, it is no surprise that online classes have become increasingly popular among high school students. As we move deeper into the 21st century, more and more students and parents are questioning whether online courses can provide an adequate educational experience for high school students. As a matter of fact, there are both advantages and disadvantages to taking online classes. 

On the one hand, the flexibility that online courses offer is attractive to both students and parents. For students, who often have competing demands on their time, being able to attend classes from the comfort of their own home can be a huge benefit. For parents, the comfort of knowing that their children are not in a physical classroom environment can be a relief. Additionally, online classes often provide additional resources like student-led discussion boards and forums which can be a great way for students to connect with peers and get the kind of support they might not get in a traditional classroom environment.

On the other hand, the lack of face-to-face interaction and the potential for distraction are two drawbacks of taking online courses. For students, having no peers or teachers around for support can be a challenge. For parents, not being able to physically monitor their children's progress in the classroom can be a source of worry. Additionally, distractions such as watching TV or playing video games while taking an online class can lead to lower grades and incomplete assignments.

Overall, it is clear that online classes can provide an appropriate educational experience for high school students, but it is important to consider the pros and cons before making a decision. Students and parents should weigh the benefits of taking an online class against the potential drawbacks in order to determine which option is best for them.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4

"As an 8th grader, I strongly believe that having a curfew is crucial for teenagers. After conducting research on the effects of lack of sleep on teens and the potential risks of not having a curfew, I have come to realize that it is essential to establish guidelines for our safety and well-being.

Firstly, lack of sleep has severe consequences on our health and cognitive abilities. According to the National Sleep Foundation, teenagers need around 8-10 hours of sleep each night to function properly. However, many of us tend to stay up late, scrolling through our phones or hanging out with friends, which can lead to chronic sleep deprivation. This can result in impaired cognitive function, mood disturbances, and even an increased risk of accidents and injuries. Moreover, sleep deprivation can affect our mental health, causing anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.

Secondly, not having a curfew can lead to unsafe situations, such as teenagers being out late at night without proper supervision. This can expose them to drugs, alcohol, and other harmful substances, which can have long-term consequences for their health and well-being. Additionally, being out late at night can increase the risk of encountering dangerous individuals, such as predators or criminals. By having a curfew, parents can ensure that their children are safe and secure at home, rather than being vulnerable to these risks.

However, some people may argue that having a curfew infringes upon their personal freedom and privacy. They may feel that their parents should not have complete control over their whereabouts and activities. While it is important to respect individual freedom, I believe that safety and well-being should take precedence. As a teenager, I value my safety and the safety of my peers, and I believe that a curfew is necessary to ensure that we are protected from harm.

Moreover, having a curfew can actually provide teenagers with more freedom and independence. By establishing clear guidelines and expectations, parents can give their children the space to make their own choices and decisions, while still providing the necessary support and supervision. This can help teen",1,llama2_chat,0
"Hey there!  So, like, I know this might sound kinda weird, but I think taking your own path and self-teaching are, like, super important life skills. I mean, think about it. When you're forced to learn something a certain way in school, it can be, like, super limiting. You might not even realize it, but it can really stifle your creativity and curiosity. 

But, like, when you take your own path and self-teach, you get to learn stuff on your own terms. You can, like, explore whatever you want, whenever you want. And, like, it's not just about learning new things. It's also about, like, discovering who you are and what you're passionate about.

"Making important life decisions independently versus seeking advice from experts and authorities is a topic that has been debated for years. While some people believe that making decisions on their own is the best way to grow and develop, others believe that seeking advice from experts and authorities is the only way to make informed decisions. In this essay, I will explore the merits of both approaches and argue that the best approach depends on the individual and the situation.

On the one hand, making important life decisions independently can be very beneficial. When you make decisions on your own, you have complete control over the outcome. You are not bound by the opinions of others, and you can make decisions based on your own values and beliefs. This can be especially important when it comes to personal relationships and career choices. When you make decisions on your own, you are also more likely to learn from your mistakes and grow as a person.

On the other hand, seeking advice from experts and authorities can also be very beneficial. When you seek advice from experts and authorities, you can benefit from their knowledge and experience. They may have insights and perspectives that you do not have, and they may be able to help you make more informed decisions. This can be especially important when it comes to major life decisions such as buying a house or starting a business. When you seek advice from experts and authorities, you are also more likely to make decisions that are in your best interest.

Ultimately, the best approach depends on the individual and the situation. If you are a confident and experienced person who values independence and personal growth, making decisions on your own may be the best approach. However, if you are unsure about a particular decision or if you are facing a major life decision, seeking advice from experts and authorities may be the best approach.

In conclusion, making important life decisions independently versus seeking advice from experts and authorities is a complex issue with no easy answer. While both approaches have their merits, the best approach depends on the individual and the situation. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach before making a decision, and to seek advice from experts and authorities when necessary. By doing so, you can make informed decisions that are in your best interest.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"It is well-documented that eating a wide variety of foods contributes to a healthy lifestyle and supports overall well-being. Introducing healthier food options in a school cafeteria would encourage students to experiment and broaden their taste preferences. Eating a more diverse range of foods can lead to a healthier diet filled with essential vitamins and minerals. 

Nevertheless, it is especially important to consider students who prefer the existing cafeteria food and how they would be affected by the introduction of healthier food options. This could be done by offering more options and variety than previously offered, catering to both healthier and existing preferences. Even small changes to existing food can still make a difference, such as adding more fruits and vegetables to existing meals or replacing unhealthy snacks with healthier ones. 

In conclusion, it is vital that schools should strive to provide students with healthy and varied food options in their cafeterias. Through the introduction of healthier choices, students can learn to make healthier dietary decisions that can stay with them through the rest of their life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Hey there! 

So, the school board is thinking about adding an extra hour and a half to our school day.  I mean, I get it, they want us to learn more and stuff, but come on, can't they see how much homework we already have?!  It's like, how are we supposed to fit in extra school time and still get enough sleep?! 

I mean, think about it. If we go to school for an extra hour and a half, that means we'll be there from 8am to 3pm.  That's a total of 5 hours in school!  And then we have to do homework in the evening, which can take up to 2 hours.  That means we'll be up until 11pm at least, trying to finish our assignments. 

And don't even get me started on the impact it'll have on our sleep.  I mean, I know the school board thinks we're little robots who can just power through our schoolwork and still get 8 hours of sleep, but let's be real.  We're teenagers. We need our sleep.  And with that extra hour and a half in school, it'll be even harder to get the rest we need. 

So, what can we do about it?  Well, I think the school board should consider some alternatives.  Maybe they could add more breaks throughout the day, so we can actually take a breather and relax.  Or, they could give us more time to finish our homework, so we're not staying up late every night. 

I mean, I know the school board wants us to be well-rounded and stuff, but they also need to think about our well-being.  We're not machines, you know.  We need rest and relaxation too. 

So, there you have it.",1,llama2_chat,2
"After researching the partnerships, local companies, and organizations associated with my school, I discovered many activities associated with each of them. For example, the local theater company offers volunteer opportunities, while the art museum provides educational outreach programs to the community. Additionally, each of these entities offers a unique workplace environment. The theater company has a relaxed and creative atmosphere, while the art museum has a more formal and professional environment. I must now consider which type of workplace would be the best fit for my interests and preferences.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Sure thing! Here's my essay:

Hey there! So, I've been thinking a lot about skills and how they can help us grow as people. And I realized that I've actually mastered one skill that I'm really proud of - playing the guitar! It's been a few years now since I started learning, and I've put in a ton of practice time. I mean, I'm not a rockstar or anything, but I can play some pretty cool songs and I even write my own music sometimes.

But here's the thing - I don't want to just stop at being good at the guitar. I want to get even better! So, my goal is to start taking lessons with a professional guitar teacher. I know it will be tough, but I'm determined to learn even more advanced techniques and improve my skills. And I'm not just going to stop at lessons - I'm going to practice every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. It might not seem like a lot, but every little bit helps!

And you know what the coolest part is? When I started playing the guitar, I never thought I'd be able to do it. It seemed like something that only cool people could do, but now I'm actually good at it! It's shown me that if I put my mind to something, I can accomplish it. And that's so important to remember.

I mean, think about it - if we don't challenge ourselves, we'll never know how good we can really be. We'll just stick with what we're good at and never try anything new. And that's not living life to the fullest! So, even if it's scary or hard, we should always try to push ourselves and see what we're capable of.

In conclusion, mastering a skill is super important because it shows us what we're capable of and helps us grow as people. And even though it might be hard, it's totally worth it in the end. So, let's all go out there and master something! 🎸💪",1,llama2_chat,3
"When it comes to achieving success, there are benefits and drawbacks to both working with a group and working alone. Working in a group can bring the advantage of being able to have multiple different perspectives and ideas on how to tackle an issue. This can allow for more thorough and innovative solutions and greater success overall. However, working in a group also tends to require more coordination, and can lead to frustrations due to differing opinions and differences in work styles. 

Working alone can be beneficial in that it allows for uninterrupted focus and the ability to progress quickly. Working by yourself also requires fewer resources, and can lead to achievements faster. On the other hand, working alone can mean less creative input and ideas, as well as little to no external feedback. 

When deciding whether to work alone or in a group, the focus should be on what the individual task or project requires in terms of creative input, feedback, resources, and time constraints. If more perspectives are needed to achieve success, then working in a group may be the best choice. If quick results are desired, then working alone may be the better option.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement highlights the importance of failure as a crucial aspect of the pursuit of success. Failure is not something to be feared, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. In this essay, I will analyze the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success and argue that failure can help lead to success and make us better people.

Failure is an inevitable part of life. We all experience it at some point, whether it's in school, work, or personal relationships. However, it's not just about the number of times we fail, but how we respond to it. When we fail, we have the opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and learn from our mistakes. This process of self-reflection can help us improve our skills, knowledge, and understanding, which can ultimately lead to success.

Moreover, failure teaches us resilience and perseverance. When we face failure, we may feel discouraged and defeated, but we must learn to push through and keep trying. This requires a great deal of courage and determination, which are essential qualities for success. By facing failure and overcoming it, we build our character and become stronger, more resilient individuals.

Furthermore, failure can help us develop empathy and compassion towards others. When we fail, we may feel embarrassed or ashamed, but we must remember that everyone fails at some point. By acknowledging and accepting our own failures, we can better understand and support others who are struggling. This can lead to stronger relationships and a more compassionate society.

In conclusion, failure plays a crucial role in the pursuit of success. It provides us with valuable lessons, teaches us resilience and perseverance, and helps us develop empathy and compassion towards others. We must embrace failure as an opportunity for growth and use it to propel ourselves towards success. As Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.""",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Ugh, I can't believe I got that bad grade on my math test!  It's really frustrating when you put in so much effort and still don't do well. I know I'm not the best at math, but I thought I at least did okay. 

But, you know what? I know I can't change the past, so I might as well focus on the future.  Having a positive attitude during difficult times is super important. It can help you cope with challenges and bounce back from setbacks. Like, if you have a positive mindset, you're more likely to be motivated to try harder and do better next time. 

One thing you can do to maintain a positive attitude is to practice positive self-talk.  This means talking to yourself in a nice way, like telling yourself you can do something instead of putting yourself down. Like, instead of saying ""I'm so stupid for getting that bad grade,"" you could say ""I'm going to work hard and do better next time.""  It might feel weird at first, but it really does help!

Another thing you can do is to focus on the good things in your life.  Like, even though you didn't do well on that test, maybe you had a great day otherwise. You could focus on that instead of dwelling on the bad grade.  It's like, why get bogged down by one thing when there are so many other good things happening? 

And, you know what? It's okay to have a bad day sometimes.  Everyone has bad days, and it's normal to feel upset or frustrated. But, it's important to not let those feelings get the best of you.  You can still have a positive attitude even when things aren't going your way. 

So, there you have it!  Having a positive attitude during difficult times is super important, and practicing positive self-talk and focusing on the good things in your life can really help.  It might not be easy",1,llama2_chat,4

"Studying the arts in school can provide students with invaluable life skills. Arts such as music, drama, and visual arts not only offer students the opportunity to flex their creative muscles, but they also help students learn to communicate and collaborate effectively.

In music classes, students learn to work together as a team and express complex emotions and ideas. Students are forced to learn the music and understand each other's parts in order to create something beautiful. Not only do students learn the fundamentals of music theory, they also learn to express themselves and communicate through improvisation.

Additionally, drama classes help students practice communication skills and confidence. By performing directly in front of an audience, students learn to speak out loud and stand by their own words. They also learn to listen to and respond to their peers in a constructive way.

Visual arts classes provide students with yet another opportunity to practice communication. By creating their own works, students are forced to explain the idea behind the artwork throughout the entire process. Additionally, students learn to recognize feedback and take criticism constructively.

In conclusion, classes like music, drama, and visual arts can provide essential life skills to high school students. Students learn the importance of teamwork and communication while having fun and creating something beautiful. Such classes can provide the stepping stones to developing successful careers and ultimately achieving personal fulfillment.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Thomas Jefferson was one of the founding fathers of the United States of America and a strong advocate for individual rights and freedoms. However, he also believed in the importance of hard work and coming together to serve each other with respect. In this essay, I will explore Jefferson's life and beliefs about these topics and how they apply to the present day.

Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, in Port Conway, Virginia. He was a self-taught polymath, who was interested in a wide range of subjects, including science, philosophy, and politics. Jefferson believed that individual rights and freedoms were essential for a successful society, and he advocated for these principles throughout his life.

One of Jefferson's most famous quotes is ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" This quote, which is part of the Declaration of Independence, reflects Jefferson's belief in the importance of individual rights and freedoms. He believed that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their own happiness and that government should not infringe on these rights.

Jefferson also believed in the importance of hard work and coming together to serve each other with respect. He believed that individuals should work hard to improve themselves and their communities. Jefferson was a strong advocate for education and believed that everyone should have access to education, regardless of their social or economic status. He also believed in the importance of community service and volunteering.

In the present day, Jefferson's beliefs about hard work and coming together to serve each other with respect are still relevant. In today's society, many people still believe in the importance of individual rights and freedoms. However, there is also a growing recognition of the importance of community and coming together to serve each other. This is reflected in the increasing popularity of volunteer work and community service.

Jefferson's belief in the importance of education is also still relevant today. Education is a key factor in personal and societal success, and many people still believe that everyone should have access to education, regardless of their social or economic status.

"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that it is better to have a summer break than to have it at different times throughout the year. While some may argue that having breaks at different times would allow students to have a better work-life balance, I believe that having a traditional summer break has several benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Firstly, having too many breaks throughout the year can hinder students' learning progress. While breaks are important for students to rest and recharge, they can also lead to a loss of momentum and a decrease in productivity. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling to keep up with the demands of school. By having a traditional summer break, students can take a longer break from academics and have a chance to catch up on any missed material.

Secondly, having a summer break allows students to spend more time with their family and friends. This is particularly important for students who may feel isolated or overwhelmed during the school year. During the summer, students can take a break from the stresses of school and spend quality time with the people who matter most to them. This can help to improve their mental health and overall well-being.

Thirdly, having a summer break can make it easier for students to do their work. During the school year, students may have to juggle multiple responsibilities, such as homework, extracurricular activities, and a part-time job. This can be particularly challenging for students who are trying to maintain a work-life balance. By having a summer break, students can take a break from these responsibilities and focus on getting caught up on any missed work.

Finally, having a summer break can help students to be more successful in school. By taking a break from academics, students can recharge and come back to school with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation. This can lead to better grades, improved attendance, and a greater overall success in school.

In conclusion, while some may argue that having breaks at different times throughout the year would allow students to have a better work-life balance, I believe that having a traditional summer break has several benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks. By having a summer break, students can catch up on missed material, spend more time with their family and friends, do their work more easily, and be more successful in school.

"Hey there!  So, you're asking us to research the effects of culture, practice, and adjustment on first impressions, and how they can change.  Like, I know it's a pretty deep topic, but I'll do my best to dive in. 😅

First of all, let's talk about culture.  Culture plays a huge role in shaping our first impressions of people. For example, in some cultures, it's common to greet someone with a hug or a kiss on the cheek, while in other cultures, it's more common to shake hands or bow.  I mean, can you imagine if you went to a party and someone gave you a hug without asking? 😳 It would be so awkward! But, on the other hand, if you're in a culture where hugs are a common greeting, it could make you feel more comfortable and relaxed around that person. 

Now, let's talk about practice.  Practice can also shape our first impressions. For instance, if someone is really good at a particular skill or activity, we might be more likely to form a positive impression of them.  Like, if someone is a great singer or musician, you might be more likely to think they're cool and talented.  But, on the other hand, if someone is really bad at something, it could make you think they're not very smart or capable. 

Lastly, let's talk about adjustment.  Adjustment can also play a role in shaping our first impressions. For example, if someone is new to a group or situation, we might be more likely to form a negative impression of them if they don't fit in right away.  Like, if someone is the new kid in class and they don't know the rules or customs, they might get teased or bullied.  But, if they keep trying and eventually figure things out, we might start to see them in a more positive light.

"Career pathways are an important aspect of a student's life. It is essential for students to understand the different options available to them and to choose the one that best suits their interests and skills. In addition to choosing a career path, it is also important for students to gain practical experience in their chosen field. This can be achieved through partnerships with local companies.

One way to help students become aware of their interests is through career counseling. Career counselors can provide students with information about different career paths, as well as help them assess their skills and interests. This can be done through assessments, interviews, and other tools. By understanding their interests, students can make more informed decisions about their career path.

Partnerships with local companies can provide students with valuable opportunities to gain experience in their chosen field. These partnerships can take many forms, including internships, apprenticeships, and mentorship programs. Through these programs, students can gain hands-on experience in their chosen field, learn about the work that companies do, and network with professionals in their industry.

In addition to providing practical experience, partnerships with local companies can also benefit students in other ways. For example, these partnerships can provide students with valuable networking opportunities, which can be helpful when they graduate and enter the workforce. They can also provide students with the opportunity to learn about the skills and qualifications that are required for different careers.

Overall, partnerships with local companies can be a valuable tool for helping students understand their interests and gain practical experience in their chosen field.

"In the current digital age, online activities, such as shopping, playing games, and connecting with people on social media sites, have revolutionized the way in which groups of people interact. There are numerous potential benefits of engaging with these activities, such as the ease of access to people outside of your geographical area or the ability to purchase items without leaving your house. However, it is also important to consider the risks associated with partaking in these activities as well; for example, scams, identity theft, and digital addiction. 

We live in a world where staying connected is becoming increasingly important; however, with these connections come some important caveats. Undoubtedly, it can be beneficial to remain digitally connected with the world and have access to others’ insights and opportunities, however, it is also crucial to keep in mind that not everyone needs to know all the information about other people. Maintaining the boundaries between private and public information can be difficult in our current online-focused culture, and therefore requires dedicated effort in order to do so. Thus, it is important to remain connected with the digital world, in order to keep up with the changing times, while also establishing limits on just how much time and energy are put into these activities.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Hey there, Mrs. Johnson! 

I'm super stoked to be writing this essay about whether the school board should add one and a half hours to the school day. As an 8th grader, I've got a lot of thoughts on this topic, and I'm gonna share 'em with you.

First off, let's talk about physical and mental well-being. Adding more time to the school day could be a total game-changer for us students. We could have more time for PE, which is like, super important for our health and fitness. And let's be real, who doesn't love recess? It's like, the highlight of my day. More time in school means more time for us to learn, play, and just chill with our friends. Plus, it'll give us more time to de-stress and relax, which is crucial for our mental health.

But, here's the thing. Adding more time to the school day could also have some pretty big impacts on family dynamics. Like, my parents are always stressing about getting me to school on time, and adding more time would just make things harder for them. They might have to adjust their work schedules or find other childcare options, which could be tough. And let's not forget about the cost of transportation – more time in school means more money for bus passes or gas. It's like, a lot to think about.

And don't even get me started on student morale. I mean, let's be real, we're already feeling pretty burnt out from the regular school day. Adding more time could make things feel even more exhausting and stressful. We might start to feel like we're never gonna catch up on our homework or get enough sleep, which could totally affect our grades and overall well-being.

So, like, what do you think? Should the school board add one and a half hours to the school day? I think it's a tough call, but I'm definitely on the fence about it. I mean, more time in school could be awesome, but it could also be super stressful and hard for some people. What do you think, Mrs. Johnson?",1,llama2_chat,1

"Pet Daycares:

Pet daycares are facilities that offer a variety of services for pets, including grooming, boarding, and daycare. These facilities are designed to provide a safe and comfortable environment for pets while their owners are away. Pet daycares typically offer a range of activities for pets, such as playtime, exercise, and socialization. In addition to these services, many pet daycares also offer specialized care for pets with specific needs, such as dogs with separation anxiety or senior pets.

When choosing a pet daycare, it is important to research the facility's qualifications and experience. Look for a facility that has certified and trained staff, and that follows industry best practices for pet care. It is also important to consider the facility's location and availability, as well as their pricing and services.

Types of Fish and their Necessary Habitat Requirements:

Fish are a popular pet for many people, but they require a specific habitat to thrive. Different types of fish have different requirements for their environment, including water temperature, pH level, and tank size. Some fish, such as tropical fish, require warm water and a well-maintained aquarium with a variety of decorations and hiding places. Other fish, such as cold water fish, require a cooler environment with a well-filtered tank.

In addition to these basic requirements, it is important to provide fish with a balanced diet and regular maintenance. This includes feeding them a high-quality diet, monitoring their water chemistry, and performing regular water changes. By providing the right habitat and care, fish can live healthy and happy lives as pets.

Impact of Temperature Changes on Plants:

Temperature changes can have a significant impact on plants, both indoors and outdoors. Plants require a specific temperature range to grow and thrive, and even small changes in temperature can cause stress or damage. For example, plants that are kept in a room with a draft or near a heating vent may experience temperature fluctuations that can harm them.

To ensure that plants are correctly taken care of, it is important to monitor their temperature and provide them with the right amount of light and water. This includes placing them in a location with the appropriate amount of sunlight, watering them regularly, and providing them with proper drainage.

"Ummm... Okay, so...

I think, umm, a lot of people are, like, trying to be something they're not, instead of just being themselves. Like, they see someone else who's successful or popular or whatever, and they're like, ""Oh, I want to be like them!"" But they're not really thinking about if that's what they truly want, or if they're just trying to impress others. And then they end up, like, miserable or something.

Like, my friend Sarah, she's always trying to be this perfect student and get all the good grades and stuff, but she's not really passionate about any of it. She's just doing it to make her parents happy or something. And I'm like, ""Dude, why are you doing this if you don't even care about it?"" But she's like, ""I don't know, I just don't want to disappoint them."" And it's like, girl, you're not going to be happy if you're not being true to yourself!

And it's not just with school stuff, it's like, with their whole lives. People are constantly trying to fit in with the ""cool kids"" or the ""popular crowd"" or whatever, even if it means sacrificing their own happiness. And it's like, why are you doing this? Are you really going to be happy pretending to be someone you're not?

And then there's this quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson that I really like. He's like, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" And I think that's so true. Like, if you're not being true to yourself, you're never going to be happy or fulfilled. You're just going to be this fake version of yourself, and that's not worth it.

So, yeah, I think people should just be themselves and not try to be something they're not. It's hard, I know, because there's a lot of pressure to conform and fit in, but it's important to be true to yourself and do what",1,llama2_chat,1
"The old adage of ""If at first you don't succeed, try again"" exemplifies one of the most essential elements for achieving success in life. That element is determination; the unwavering drive and commitment to persist in the pursuit of one's aspirations. An often-told story involving a spider perfectly demonstrates this concept: No matter how many times the spider fell from the ceiling, it continued to climb back up, never giving up until it reached its goal. Although this fable is an exaggeration, it does serve as a metaphor for never relenting in the face of adversity.

Failure is inevitable in life; however, failure should not be viewed as a roadblock to success, but rather as an opportunity to learn and grow. In order to overcome failure and succeed in the long run, one must remain vigilant and be encouraged to keep striving for excellence. Furthermore, having enthusiasm for one's goals is a major factor in achieving success, as it cultivates motivation and brings passion to the process.

Strides in life can also be made through hard work and dedication. Pouring all of one's effort into their ambitions can open many doors for opportunities that will otherwise be missed. In order to make the best of those opportunities, the key is to keep going and refuse to back down from any challenge that may arise. 

By sticking to one’s convictions and being caffeinated by determination, encouragement, enthusiasm, and hard work, success can be attained. In the same way the spider never wavered from its goal, inspire yourself to adopt the same unwavering attitude and achieve your goals - no matter what stands in your way.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

"Introduction:

The education system has always been focused on the younger generation, but there is a growing trend of older students helping younger students in various life skills. These programs have been gaining popularity in many countries, and their impact on the environment is also being studied. This essay will explore the benefits of older students helping younger students, the ways in which they can teach them various life skills, and the impact such programs would have on the environment.

Teaching Life Skills:

Older students can teach younger students various life skills, such as walking, social etiquette, and respect for others. These skills are essential for a person's growth and development. For example, older students can teach younger students how to walk safely on the streets, how to behave appropriately in social situations, and how to show respect for others. These skills will help younger students become more confident and responsible individuals.

Benefits of Older Students Helping Younger Students:

There are several benefits to having older students help younger students. Firstly, it provides educational opportunities for younger students. Older students can share their knowledge and experiences with younger students, which can help them learn more about the world around them. Secondly, it can improve job prospects for older students. Many employers value the skills and experience that older students bring to the workplace. Finally, it can help older students gain new talents and skills. For example, teaching younger students can help older students improve their communication and leadership skills.
